            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um, I believe the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They have been discussing how the Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because, often, the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. For example, like gay marriage, abortion, contraception, and so on. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, which is fine, but they are sometimes a bit outdated. So, if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nUm, I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. People don't agree with them on certain topics anymore, and they feel that the Church has the wrong views on these subjects. For instance, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not be comfortable in a faith that considers it completely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to pursue it, you might not want to follow a faith that doesn't agree with that.\n\nUm, I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. But I don't think allowing these changes would have necessarily prevented what happened. While I believe priests can't have families, it's hard to say if they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. The Church doesn't seem to have been affected by these restrictions much. I mean, if they were married, would they have acted differently? It's hard to tell.\n\nWell, I don't see why priests can't have families. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their life to God, but everyone else with a job also has a family life and is devoted to other people. So, why can't priests have both? No.",
            "Well, I personally don’t object to same-sex marriage. I don’t think it’s something people choose consciously. So, I think it’s wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a choice. People don’t have a choice about how they are born. I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It’s not like they made a conscious decision for which they should be held responsible.\n\nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because it’s not a legal or moral issue. It’s just how people are. They shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nBecause, in essence, there isn't a convincing reason not to.\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but in reality, the situation is much more complex. The dynamics and aspects of these relationships are so different that they can't be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin: heads and tails, but essentially the same.\nMoreover, there are various civil rights associated with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare, where, for instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed in the hospital or permitted to make medical decisions for their partner because they're not considered family.\nI think this is silly if you're spending the rest of your life with someone.\nNumerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\nThe main issue is that people seem to get hung up on the idea of same-sex couples not wanting to get married in a church. They're asking for a marriage certificate and legal recognition, not a religious ceremony.\nAnd if there's no religious involvement, there shouldn't be an issue. People from various religions, including Catholics, shouldn't be able to use their beliefs to oppose civil rights.\nIt's akin to segregation: separate but unequal.\nGay couples and heterosexual couples are similar in many ways, with the roles they play in relationships. People also worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple living in a community might affect it, and how children of gay couples will adjust.\nHowever, the treatment children receive from their peers and adults is often more concerning. In places like New York City, special schools are needed for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools. Parents have to fight to remove their children from these schools.\nAgain, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite.\nHowever, I think President Bush has very strong views on this issue, much like his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons against same-sex marriage seem to be moral in nature, but morality varies from person to person.\nEmbracing the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, especially considering recent controversies.\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, resulting from childhood trauma or personality defects. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these ideas, and people should rely on research and facts instead of popular opinion or cultural trends.",

It's not beneficial.\nYou know what I mean?\n\nYeah, I mean there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone,\nUm\nVicodin\nPercoets\nThat kind of thing\nAnd those are controlled substances\nBut we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana,\nThen there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\nUm\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it can lead to bad things.\nUm\nIt's tough. I'd say,\nNot\nYou could integrate it\nLike gradually make it legal, not all at once\nBecause then it would be abused, but if you just\nYou have to remove that taboo around marijuana first\nAnd then people might use it responsibly.\nUm\nYeah\nPeople have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug\nBut\nI mean it's not that bad for you\nIt's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that\nUm\nSo\nIf we remove that image of marijuana as this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly\nAnd certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",

            "I was initially fine with the premise, but people were still reeling from the September 11th attacks, which led to our invasion of Iraq, presumably under some pretext.

This really bothers me, as does the Iraq war in general.\n\nUm\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and has yet to admit it.\nEven Colin Powell, after his big UN presentation, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time.\nI think that's an abuse of power, and it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think the Bush administration has total disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least September 11th.\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of the\nUm\nSecretary of the Treasury who basically made that allegation in his book after being forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and I think in the long term he was aiming to secure more energy resources for us,\nWhich is a very sneaky way to do things.\n\nUm\nI think we've been in this long enough.\nI think there would be issues if we withdrew right now because there's a high chance the country could descend into civil war and more people would die.\nUm\nThe alternative being pushed by the UN and the US seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order.\nBut I'm not sure if that's a good idea, as it could cause more problems in the long run because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as it seems the interim government is falling apart.\n\nFrom the news reports I've heard, it seems the Parliament isn't very effective.\nUm\nI can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any control over the political process or what's going on.\nEven Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.\nI think the political process is facing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nI can't articulate any of this in polite company",

            "I really don't feel it's right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I think any attempt to enforce power over it would be a defiance of what's already been written. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can and can't make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of our constitution and promotes religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments to restrict people rather than the government. I don't feel it's right. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment to ban it, as it might even have a positive impact on society. Umm, I think I've said it all.",
            "OK\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality didn't have much to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people because of the outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm\nI\nI myself was against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died.\nAnd that’s horrible.\nWhat they were doing was removing the country’s government. I really don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm\nAnd here\nAnd the government\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam.\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold and implement democracy.\nAnd that’s what they should have learned from the Vietnam War. It’s not going to be a clear victory like it wasn’t in Vietnam because there are always going to be insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens of the country.\nI think that the government should have been more prepared for this kind of situation.\nI mean, the government wasn’t prepared for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government.\nI mean, we’re still there today and almost at the end of 2006 and we’re still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government, in a way, tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq.\nWell, it’s not that easy. It takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today. There was a lot of tension and there was a civil war.\nSo, it’s just not an easy thing to do.\nI think the government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do.\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because\nWell, that was my feeling in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote. One of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started.\nAnd so, it's really hard because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people?\nI mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now?\nSo it’s probably something that we should try to see it through.\nBut again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nMeaning, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. This is where we get our oil from. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nMeaning, another one of the pretenses for going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found.\nAnd yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Let’s see, I’m in favor of gay marriage, as I’ve always been. I truly believe it’s a personal preference, and I think it’s more biological than sociological. It seems inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I’ve always advocated for gay marriage. I don’t think politics or government should interfere with this; it’s a personal, household matter, not a state-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples, and they function like any other family. I think it’s ridiculous for someone like Bush to try to interpret marriage as he likes. I mean, I’ve read and heard that it’s a chemical thing in the brain, you might be predisposed to be homosexual. It’s not about your upbringing. With gay marriage, it’s like if a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it secretly, but if two gay people want to, it makes the news. I think it should be a private matter, not a public or national issue.",

            "I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much. I think the purpose was good in the beginning. It was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. We're now maybe doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motives were questionable, dealing with George Bush's father's previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. So I think the original motivation, if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters in it, I do not think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. We got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war. I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out. Yeah, I think it has gone on long enough. It should stop. I mean there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and whatnot that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements. You know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Health care that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this?\n\nWell, I think it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um.\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else as a member to see someone's profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, any time you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um.\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\n\nUm, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across. Or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that? Or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So I don't really know.\n\nSure.\nWell, um, like I said, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about this man who was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone. But I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos.\n\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think is that the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh.\nWell, I heard my roommate telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it's not just women, but also men and other genders.\nI feel it has something to do with the particular field of work you're in.\nUm\nOverall, I feel that women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even when equality is supposed to be the norm, many people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man.\nIt's because society has been like this for so long.\nAnd so in the workplace, women often find that they're qualified for a job but aren't promoted to that position just because historically, women haven't been seen in higher positions in the business world.\nAnd the same goes for men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\nIt's really uncommon to see a man stay at home to raise children.\nUm\nA lot of people look down on that because society thinks a man should be the one working and making money.\nSo it can be really tough for men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wife has the better job.\nAnd in the fashion industry,\nUm\nPeople often don't take men seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it seems like people think men in fashion might not understand what women are like.\nSo depending on the field of work, I feel there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nChanging it is difficult because society has a set mindset.\nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change takes time.\nUm\nYes, I think it's also about promoting the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against.\nYou need to show their strengths without being too pushy.\nUm\nI feel we're at a good balance now where it's starting to happen.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long way; change takes time.\nUm\nI guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on their job or where they're from.\nIf you grew up on a farm with poor grammar but are extremely intelligent, other people might look down on you, thinking you can't be a CEO if you can't speak well.\nUm\nYeah, so sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you, and so can gender discrimination.\nI don't know, I guess that's another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means that it's similar to a traffic ticket. You just get cited and don't go to jail or court. If you get caught and cited, it could affect job interviews or other things. While it's decriminalized, people are still worried about future ramifications. It costs a lot to arrest and house people, but some places don't want to decriminalize it because of their stance on it. In Denver, which is more open-minded, they've benefited financially, allowing them to spend more on public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nI was all for going over there and causing as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI think, given the emotional impact of what happened,\nwe overlooked many things and didn’t think much about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of went over there like we were unprepared, without a plan\nUm\nAnd I really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI don’t know\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very much against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike, I don’t think our presence there will make any difference if they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo, um\nLike unfortunately, because of 9/11, I’ve just\nI just don’t care anymore about what happens over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re even human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they just can’t\nThey’re just incapable\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there without knowing what we were getting into\nWe didn’t know what to expect over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war is different for them compared to us\nThey’re more like savage people when it comes to war, and I don’t think they’re looking to improve their country\nI just think they want to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave, that’s all\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because\npretty much because the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time, I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t do that and us just say, “OK, let’s rebuild and that’s it.”\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could’ve let it go\nBut I think we could’ve had a better plan of what we were going to do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly, I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there,\nOnce we leave, it’s just going to collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo, I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um, I believe the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They have been discussing how the Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because, often, the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. For example, like gay marriage, abortion, contraception, and so on. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, which is fine, but they are sometimes a bit outdated. So, if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nUm, I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. People don't agree with them on certain topics anymore, and they feel that the Church has the wrong views on these subjects. For instance, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not be comfortable in a faith that considers it completely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to pursue it, you might not want to follow a faith that doesn't agree with that.\n\nUm, I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. But I don't think allowing these changes would have necessarily prevented what happened. While I believe priests can't have families, it's hard to say if they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. The Church doesn't seem to have been affected by these restrictions much. I mean, if they were married, would they have acted differently? It's hard to tell.\n\nWell, I don't see why priests can't have families. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their life to God, but everyone else with a job also has a family life and is devoted to other people. So, why can't priests have both? No.",
            "Well, I personally don’t object to same-sex marriage. I don’t think it’s something people choose consciously. So, I think it’s wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a choice. People don’t have a choice about how they are born. I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It’s not like they made a conscious decision for which they should be held responsible.\n\nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because it’s not a legal or moral issue. It’s just how people are. They shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nBecause, in essence, there isn't a convincing reason not to.\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but in reality, the situation is much more complex. The dynamics and aspects of these relationships are so different that they can't be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin: heads and tails, but essentially the same.\nMoreover, there are various civil rights associated with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare, where, for instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed in the hospital or permitted to make medical decisions for their partner because they're not considered family.\nI think this is silly if you're spending the rest of your life with someone.\nNumerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\nThe main issue is that people seem to get hung up on the idea of same-sex couples not wanting to get married in a church. They're asking for a marriage certificate and legal recognition, not a religious ceremony.\nAnd if there's no religious involvement, there shouldn't be an issue. People from various religions, including Catholics, shouldn't be able to use their beliefs to oppose civil rights.\nIt's akin to segregation: separate but unequal.\nGay couples and heterosexual couples are similar in many ways, with the roles they play in relationships. People also worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple living in a community might affect it, and how children of gay couples will adjust.\nHowever, the treatment children receive from their peers and adults is often more concerning. In places like New York City, special schools are needed for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools. Parents have to fight to remove their children from these schools.\nAgain, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite.\nHowever, I think President Bush has very strong views on this issue, much like his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons against same-sex marriage seem to be moral in nature, but morality varies from person to person.\nEmbracing the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, especially considering recent controversies.\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, resulting from childhood trauma or personality defects. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these ideas, and people should rely on research and facts instead of popular opinion or cultural trends.",

It's not beneficial.\nYou know what I mean?\n\nYeah, I mean there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone,\nUm\nVicodin\nPercoets\nThat kind of thing\nAnd those are controlled substances\nBut we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana,\nThen there's no point in doing that for me.

I'd say,\nNot\nYou could integrate it\nLike gradually make it legal, not all at once\nBecause then it would be abused, but if you just\nYou have to remove that taboo around marijuana first\nAnd then people might use it responsibly.\nUm\nYeah\nPeople have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug\nBut\nI mean it's not that bad for you\nIt's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that\nUm\nSo\nIf we remove that image of marijuana as this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly\nAnd certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",

            "I was initially fine with the premise, but people were still reeling from the September 11th attacks, which led to our invasion of Iraq, presumably under some pretext.

This really bothers me, as does the Iraq war in general.\n\nUm\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and has yet to admit it.\nEven Colin Powell, after his big UN presentation, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time.\nI think that's an abuse of power, and it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think the Bush administration has total disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least September 11th.\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of the\nUm\nSecretary of the Treasury who basically made that allegation in his book after being forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and I think in the long term he was aiming to secure more energy resources for us,\nWhich is a very sneaky way to do things.\n\nUm\nI think we've been in this long enough.\nI think there would be issues if we withdrew right now because there's a high chance the country could descend into civil war and more people would die.\nUm\nThe alternative being pushed by the UN and the US seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order.\nBut I'm not sure if that's a good idea, as it could cause more problems in the long run because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as it seems the interim government is falling apart.\n\nFrom the news reports I've heard, it seems the Parliament isn't very effective.\nUm\nI can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any control over the political process or what's going on.\nEven Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.\nI think the political process is facing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nI can't articulate any of this in polite company",

            "I really don't feel it's right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I think any attempt to enforce power over it would be a defiance of what's already been written. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can and can't make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of our constitution and promotes religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments to restrict people rather than the government. I don't feel it's right. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment to ban it, as it might even have a positive impact on society. Umm, I think I've said it all.",
            "OK\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality didn't have much to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people because of the outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm\nI\nI myself was against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died.\nAnd that’s horrible.\nWhat they were doing was removing the country’s government. I really don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm\nAnd here\nAnd the government\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam.\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold and implement democracy.\nAnd that’s what they should have learned from the Vietnam War. It’s not going to be a clear victory like it wasn’t in Vietnam because there are always going to be insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens of the country.\nI think that the government should have been more prepared for this kind of situation.\nI mean, the government wasn’t prepared for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government.\nI mean, we’re still there today and almost at the end of 2006 and we’re still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government, in a way, tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq.\nWell, it’s not that easy. It takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today. There was a lot of tension and there was a civil war.\nSo, it’s just not an easy thing to do.\nI think the government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do.\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because\nWell, that was my feeling in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote. One of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started.\nAnd so, it's really hard because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people?\nI mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now?\nSo it’s probably something that we should try to see it through.\nBut again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nMeaning, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. This is where we get our oil from. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nMeaning, another one of the pretenses for going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found.\nAnd yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Let’s see, I’m in favor of gay marriage, as I’ve always been. I truly believe it’s a personal preference, and I think it’s more biological than sociological. It seems inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I’ve always advocated for gay marriage. I don’t think politics or government should interfere with this; it’s a personal, household matter, not a state-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples, and they function like any other family. I think it’s ridiculous for someone like Bush to try to interpret marriage as he likes. I mean, I’ve read and heard that it’s a chemical thing in the brain, you might be predisposed to be homosexual. It’s not about your upbringing. With gay marriage, it’s like if a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it secretly, but if two gay people want to, it makes the news. I think it should be a private matter, not a public or national issue.",

            "I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much. I think the purpose was good in the beginning. It was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. We're now maybe doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motives were questionable, dealing with George Bush's father's previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. So I think the original motivation, if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters in it, I do not think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. We got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war. I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out. Yeah, I think it has gone on long enough. It should stop. I mean there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and whatnot that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements. You know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Health care that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this?\n\nWell, I think it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um.\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else as a member to see someone's profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, any time you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um.\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\n\nUm, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across. Or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that? Or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So I don't really know.\n\nSure.\nWell, um, like I said, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about this man who was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone. But I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos.\n\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think is that the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh.\nWell, I heard my roommate telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it's not just women, but also men and other genders.\nI feel it has something to do with the particular field of work you're in.\nUm\nOverall, I feel that women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even when equality is supposed to be the norm, many people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man.\nIt's because society has been like this for so long.\nAnd so in the workplace, women often find that they're qualified for a job but aren't promoted to that position just because historically, women haven't been seen in higher positions in the business world.\nAnd the same goes for men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\nIt's really uncommon to see a man stay at home to raise children.\nUm\nA lot of people look down on that because society thinks a man should be the one working and making money.\nSo it can be really tough for men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wife has the better job.\nAnd in the fashion industry,\nUm\nPeople often don't take men seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it seems like people think men in fashion might not understand what women are like.\nSo depending on the field of work, I feel there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nChanging it is difficult because society has a set mindset.\nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change takes time.\nUm\nYes, I think it's also about promoting the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against.\nYou need to show their strengths without being too pushy.\nUm\nI feel we're at a good balance now where it's starting to happen.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long way; change takes time.\nUm\nI guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on their job or where they're from.\nIf you grew up on a farm with poor grammar but are extremely intelligent, other people might look down on you, thinking you can't be a CEO if you can't speak well.\nUm\nYeah, so sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you, and so can gender discrimination.\nI don't know, I guess that's another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means that it's similar to a traffic ticket. You just get cited and don't go to jail or court. If you get caught and cited, it could affect job interviews or other things. While it's decriminalized, people are still worried about future ramifications. It costs a lot to arrest and house people, but some places don't want to decriminalize it because of their stance on it. In Denver, which is more open-minded, they've benefited financially, allowing them to spend more on public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless.

I don't believe it should be a national issue, but rather something that each state decides individually, rather than the president making a decision for the whole country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's obvious that democratic states will push for gay marriage.

I don't think Bush has the right to decide how each state should run itself, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth.

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um, I believe the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They have been discussing how the Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because, often, the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many things. For example, like gay marriage, abortion, contraception, and so on. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, which is fine, but they are sometimes a bit outdated. So, if they adapted to a more modern way of thinking, they wouldn't have to worry about losing their followers.\n\nUm, I've heard that many people are starting to turn away from the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues. People don't agree with them on certain topics anymore, and they feel that the Church has the wrong views on these subjects. For instance, if you're in favor of abortion, you might not be comfortable in a faith that considers it completely wrong. The same goes for issues like gay marriage, where if you believe in it and want to pursue it, you might not want to follow a faith that doesn't agree with that.\n\nUm, I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. But I don't think allowing these changes would have necessarily prevented what happened. While I believe priests can't have families, it's hard to say if they would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. The Church doesn't seem to have been affected by these restrictions much. I mean, if they were married, would they have acted differently? It's hard to tell.\n\nWell, I don't see why priests can't have families. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their life to God, but everyone else with a job also has a family life and is devoted to other people. So, why can't priests have both? No.",
            "Well, I personally don’t object to same-sex marriage. I don’t think it’s something people choose consciously. So, I think it’s wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex can’t. I haven’t given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say it’s wrong for them to say that.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a choice. People don’t have a choice about how they are born. I was born straight, and some people are born gay. It’s not like they made a conscious decision for which they should be held responsible.\n\nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because it’s not a legal or moral issue. It’s just how people are. They shouldn’t be punished for that. That’s it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nBecause, in essence, there isn't a convincing reason not to.\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but in reality, the situation is much more complex. The dynamics and aspects of these relationships are so different that they can't be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin: heads and tails, but essentially the same.\nMoreover, there are various civil rights associated with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare, where, for instance, a partner in a same-sex relationship might not be allowed in the hospital or permitted to make medical decisions for their partner because they're not considered family.\nI think this is silly if you're spending the rest of your life with someone.\nNumerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\nThe main issue is that people seem to get hung up on the idea of same-sex couples not wanting to get married in a church. They're asking for a marriage certificate and legal recognition, not a religious ceremony.\nAnd if there's no religious involvement, there shouldn't be an issue. People from various religions, including Catholics, shouldn't be able to use their beliefs to oppose civil rights.\nIt's akin to segregation: separate but unequal.\nGay couples and heterosexual couples are similar in many ways, with the roles they play in relationships. People also worry about adoption and community issues, such as how a gay couple living in a community might affect it, and how children of gay couples will adjust.\nHowever, the treatment children receive from their peers and adults is often more concerning. In places like New York City, special schools are needed for children of gay parents because they face bullying and exclusion in public schools. Parents have to fight to remove their children from these schools.\nAgain, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in every state. I believe the amendment should be the opposite.\nHowever, I think President Bush has very strong views on this issue, much like his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons against same-sex marriage seem to be moral in nature, but morality varies from person to person.\nEmbracing the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on an entire country, especially considering recent controversies.\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged, resulting from childhood trauma or personality defects. However, the American Psychological Association has debunked these ideas, and people should rely on research and facts instead of popular opinion or cultural trends.",

This really bothers me, as does the Iraq war in general.\n\nUm\nIt seems to me that the Bush administration lied to the American people openly and has yet to admit it.\nEven Colin Powell, after his big UN presentation, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time.\nI think that's an abuse of power, and it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think the Bush administration has total disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least September 11th.\nUm\nThey came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nUm\nI forget the name of the\nUm\nSecretary of the Treasury who basically made that allegation in his book after being forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems like the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and I think in the long term he was aiming to secure more energy resources for us,\nWhich is a very sneaky way to do things.\n\nUm\nI think we've been in this long enough.\nI think there would be issues if we withdrew right now because there's a high chance the country could descend into civil war and more people would die.\nUm\nThe alternative being pushed by the UN and the US seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order.\nBut I'm not sure if that's a good idea, as it could cause more problems in the long run because\nUm\nIraq's sovereignty could become a major issue, as it seems the interim government is falling apart.\n\nFrom the news reports I've heard, it seems the Parliament isn't very effective.\nUm\nI can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister doesn't seem to have any control over the political process or what's going on.\nEven Muqtada al-Sadr, who we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.\nI think the political process is facing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nI can't articulate any of this in polite company",

            "I really don't feel it's right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as such. I believe it's up to the churches to decide, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I think any attempt to enforce power over it would be a defiance of what's already been written. In terms of the people trying to make it illegal, I think that's choosing one church's belief over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except for some areas like Boston. It's not the government's place to decide what churches can and can't make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of our constitution and promotes religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already been said. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments to restrict people rather than the government. I don't feel it's right. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved. The push for this amendment seems to be based on personal beliefs as a Catholic, showing a preference for one religion over others. It's up to the churches to decide, not the president or any government official. There's no valid reason for an amendment to ban it, as it might even have a positive impact on society. Umm, I think I've said it all.",
            "OK\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality didn't have much to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people because of the outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001, and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\nUm\nI\nI myself was against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the\nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died.\nAnd that’s horrible.\nWhat they were doing was removing the country’s government. I really don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\nUm\nAnd here\nAnd the government\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government. It’s kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam.\nThey were trying to push out Communists and uphold and implement democracy.\nAnd that’s what they should have learned from the Vietnam War. It’s not going to be a clear victory like it wasn’t in Vietnam because there are always going to be insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting the citizens of the country.\nI think that the government should have been more prepared for this kind of situation.\nI mean, the government wasn’t prepared for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government.\nI mean, we’re still there today and almost at the end of 2006 and we’re still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government, in a way, tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq.\nWell, it’s not that easy. It takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today. There was a lot of tension and there was a civil war.\nSo, it’s just not an easy thing to do.\nI think the government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do.\nSo\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because\nWell, that was my feeling in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote. One of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started.\nAnd so, it's really hard because once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people?\nI mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now?\nSo it’s probably something that we should try to see it through.\nBut again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq?\nMeaning, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. This is where we get our oil from. It’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources.\nMeaning, another one of the pretenses for going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found.\nAnd yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Let’s see, I’m in favor of gay marriage, as I’ve always been. I truly believe it’s a personal preference, and I think it’s more biological than sociological. It seems inhumane to deny people rights over something they have no control over. I’ve always advocated for gay marriage. I don’t think politics or government should interfere with this; it’s a personal, household matter, not a state-level issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples, and they function like any other family. I think it’s ridiculous for someone like Bush to try to interpret marriage as he likes. I mean, I’ve read and heard that it’s a chemical thing in the brain, you might be predisposed to be homosexual. It’s not about your upbringing. With gay marriage, it’s like if a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it secretly, but if two gay people want to, it makes the news. I think it should be a private matter, not a public or national issue.",

            "I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much. I think the purpose was good in the beginning. It was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. We're now maybe doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motives were questionable, dealing with George Bush's father's previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. So I think the original motivation, if it was to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation. If there were any personal matters in it, I do not think it would have been fair. But I do think it's been drawn out. We got our purpose across in the first couple months just starting the war. I think that was a statement in and of itself. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it's way too drawn out. Yeah, I think it has gone on long enough. It should stop. I mean there comes a point when their government, their officials are gonna have to fend for themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy spending billions of dollars when we have our own wars on our own turf such as poverty and whatnot that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously such as poverty or internal improvements. You know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Health care that I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now that money's being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this?\n\nWell, I think it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOkay, um.\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else as a member to see someone's profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it. You're giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, any time you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um.\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that. But then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\n\nUm, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles. But I guess it all depends on the situation they came across. Or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that? Or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So I don't really know.\n\nSure.\nWell, um, like I said, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once about this man who was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone. But I've had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me. And it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos.\n\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think is that the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. So it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know. I mean, you never know really who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh.\nWell, I heard my roommate telling me that her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "Um\nYes, I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it's not just women, but also men and other genders.\nI feel it has something to do with the particular field of work you're in.\nUm\nOverall, I feel that women have it harder because of the glass ceiling. Even when equality is supposed to be the norm, many people have a hard time working under a woman if they are a man.\nIt's because society has been like this for so long.\nAnd so in the workplace, women often find that they're qualified for a job but aren't promoted to that position just because historically, women haven't been seen in higher positions in the business world.\nAnd the same goes for men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.\nIt's really uncommon to see a man stay at home to raise children.\nUm\nA lot of people look down on that because society thinks a man should be the one working and making money.\nSo it can be really tough for men who want to stay home with their children, especially if their wife has the better job.\nAnd in the fashion industry,\nUm\nPeople often don't take men seriously if they're straight.\nI don't know if that makes sense, but it seems like people think men in fashion might not understand what women are like.\nSo depending on the field of work, I feel there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nChanging it is difficult because society has a set mindset.\nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change takes time.\nUm\nYes, I think it's also about promoting the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped against.\nYou need to show their strengths without being too pushy.\nUm\nI feel we're at a good balance now where it's starting to happen.\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long way; change takes time.\nUm\nI guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on their job or where they're from.\nIf you grew up on a farm with poor grammar but are extremely intelligent, other people might look down on you, thinking you can't be a CEO if you can't speak well.\nUm\nYeah, so sometimes where you're from can discriminate against you, and so can gender discrimination.\nI don't know, I guess that's another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it. They decriminalized it, which means that it's similar to a traffic ticket. You just get cited and don't go to jail or court. If you get caught and cited, it could affect job interviews or other things. While it's decriminalized, people are still worried about future ramifications. It costs a lot to arrest and house people, but some places don't want to decriminalize it because of their stance on it. In Denver, which is more open-minded, they've benefited financially, allowing them to spend more on public education, social programs, and food programs for the homeless.

            "I was raised in a Christian home, so I find homosexuality to be a bit of a gray area for me. I have many gay friends, and while I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle, I think it should be legalized. I don't believe it should be a national issue, but rather something that each state decides individually, rather than the president making a decision for the whole country.\n\nMany states are either democratic or republican, and it's obvious that democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect that state's position on the issue, as you chose to live there. I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nWell, I already answered that, but I don't feel that Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to each individual state to decide whether to legalize it or not. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush has the right to decide how each state should run itself, as he doesn't live in every state. Plus, he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state, as they will be the ones to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. They have been discussing how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because, often, the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many issues. For instance, in the cases of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception, the Church has strong views, which is okay, but these views can seem old-fashioned at times. If the Church adapted to more modern thinking, it wouldn't be concerned with losing its following. I've heard that many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues and disagree with them on certain subjects. I feel that the Church's views on these matters are often incorrect. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not be comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage. I don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't believe these changes would have prevented what happened, although I don't know if they would have done things differently if priests could be married. It's hard to say for sure. I don't see why priests can't have both a family life and be devoted to their job, just like everyone else in the world.",

            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Basically, there is no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are numerous aspects to consider and it is fundamentally different, like two sides of the same coin. Many civil rights issues are at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where, for instance, a partner may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized loved one because they are not considered family.\n\nScientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same success rates in relationships and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The main issue is that people are hung up on the idea that same-sex couples are asking for church approval, but they are simply seeking legal recognition. If there is no religious involvement, this should not be an issue.\n\nPeople also worry about adoption and community impacts, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples face bullying in schools and may be treated differently. However, parenting skills are the same regardless of the parents' sexual orientation. Same-sex couples can be just as involved in their communities as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in every state. President Bush has strong religious views on this issue, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most reasons against same-sex marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among people. It is unethical to enforce one group's morality over others, especially considering recent controversies about religious phrases in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are against same-sex marriage due to the belief that gay people are psychologically damaged. However, this is not supported by research from institutions like the American Psychological Association. People should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",

            "I was initially okay with the premise but everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think that we sort of went into Iraq as a pretext with various reasons leading us into Iraq. I think early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war frustrates me. It seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge that fact. Even Colin Powell, after his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. To me, that's just a breach of duty; I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, at least since September 11th. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. I forget the name of the Treasury Secretary who made that allegation in his book after being probably forced out of his office, but it seems that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with a fractious group of radical elements who are vying for control of the government.

            "I really don't feel like it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution, it's explicitly stated that there should be a separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be defying what's already been written in the constitution. So, I think that the people trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except for in Boston and some other areas. But I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches are allowed to make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right at all, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or society.",
            "The war in Iraq was not begun with full honesty by the government towards the American people concerning the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, the government did not provide clear explanations. The Iraq invasion was linked with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but in reality, there was not much connection between the two. However, the government leveraged the public's outrage against the 9/11 attacks to initiate the Iraq invasion in 2003. Personally, I am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The Iraq War is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that followed. The United States removed Iraq's government and attempted to establish a democratic government, similar to what was tried in Vietnam. The government should have known that this would be a long and difficult process, not a clear-cut victory. The same challenges exist today, with ongoing American casualties and efforts to train Iraqi forces to govern their own country. The government underestimated the complexity and duration of the task. The initial optimism that the Iraq intervention would be short and successful was naïve. The war in Iraq is a hard decision to make. During the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to see the task through, but it is difficult to abandon the people we displaced. The large number of American casualties and the costs of continuing the war also need to be considered. The stated reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is oil, as the United States is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil. The government's decision-making process regarding Iraq was not thorough enough, as it did not account for the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, despite knowing about such weapons in North Korea. I hope that the war ends soon and peace is restored, but it seems unlikely.",

            "To begin, I believe the war has been prolonged too long. Initially, the goal was commendable—to restore democracy in a country that lacked fair political systems. However, we seem to have lost sight of that original purpose. It now appears we are engaged in the conflict merely to demonstrate our global supremacy. When considering the past, the initial motivation was likely influenced by George Bush's father's unresolved disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was genuinely to establish democracy in a country suffering under a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, over time, this purpose has been obscured, and our actions have become misguided. We appear to be at war to maintain the status quo of conflict. Additionally, the war has stretched on for too long. The local government should now be capable of managing their own affairs. Our economy is being drained by this prolonged conflict, and we have our own critical issues, such as poverty and infrastructure needs, that desperately require funding. The money spent on this war could be more effectively allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns. It's high time we end this war.",
            "Can I ask a question that clarifies that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like...\n\nO ok, um, no, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone’s profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that, but if you’ve accepted them as your friend, you’ve given them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that’s tough. Because, I mean, obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.” Um, I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on what situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people’s profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just proved how he could get information so easily. He went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it’s hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much, so it’s a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I think I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more time I need to talk about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean I hate to say you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like oh I was against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but like it’s not really important anymore\nBecause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean you just have to look at like the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean no one\nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quick sand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Um\nYes, I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it's not just women. It has to do with the particular field of work you're in.\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, where even if there's supposed to be equality, most people have difficulty working under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world.\nAnd the same thing goes for men, like in the fashion industry or being a parent at home. It's really uncommon to have a parent staying at home who's male, and a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, \"Well, you're the male, you should be out working. You should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\"\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that.\nAnd in the fashion industry, a lot of times people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males in fashion have different styles of life. So if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like, you don't really know what our case is like, like these other guys.\"\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds, but change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now—because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world—it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\"\nAnd for fashion people, they will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" So they do know where I'm coming from.\nSo, I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against. Not too pushy, but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo, I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself to work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world. Other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"\nSo, yeah.\nSo, like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender.\nI don't know.\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; they decriminalized it. It knocked it down from a criminal offense to something like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked, arrested, and brought in for all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean so, I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons. But there’s this whole, like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like, why it shouldn’t necessarily well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and in a lot of contexts. Uh, to smoke marijuana so to have it out in the open like that I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know. Um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no I don’t",
            "Yes, I would say so.\nBecause\nWell\nMany of their actions are quite traditional,\nThey’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd it’s beneficial to be rooted in traditions,\nBut it’s also crucial to be adaptable to change.\nI suppose\nA lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week,\nAnd they are quite strict about how things are done,\nAnd sometimes\nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t adhere strictly to the doctrine,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t perfect Catholics,\nAnd they also reject those of other religions,\nFor instance,\nMy parents,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic,\nThey wouldn’t marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion,\nThat’s not being tolerant of other religions,\nWe were always taught to love others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut it’s hypocritical to preach love and then not accept them in this way,\nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do certain things,\nBut the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they still continue with it.\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally believe it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut I don’t think that would necessarily stop them from committing pedophilic acts,\nIt’s a different realm,\nUm\nI don’t think it would be an issue,\nWell\nI guess\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not,\nBecause it’s children which is different from a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless.\n\nNope",

It's a matter of personal choice and I don't see how the president, whether Republican or Democratic, should impose their views on the whole country. Instead, states should have the freedom to decide based on their own values and preferences. It's not up to the president to make this decision for everyone.

            "Um\nNo, I don’t think so.\nUm\nLet me see.\nThe way I see it,\nMyspace is a public thing,\nIt’s a bulletin board,\nYou know?\nIf you look up the definition,\nUm,\nIt basically means to post for the public to see,\nOr for others to see,\nUm,\nWhatever you’re trying to get across.\nAnd,\nIf you post that on the internet,\nUm,\nYou know,\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that,\nWhether they’re school officials or not,\nUm,\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that,\nThey had every right to see it,\nBecause,\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name,\nThey could have still accessed that,\nUh,\nThrough their homes,\nUm,\nBut uh,\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting,\nYou know,\nAs long as it saves the lives of,\nUh,\nStudents,\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system,\nI think that,\nUh,\nThat’s perfectly fine.\nUm,\nLet me see here,\nLike,\nUm,\nYou know,\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if,\nYou know,\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they’re not supposed to be doing,\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students,\nAnd,\nTo get them in trouble,\nAnd,\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy,\nBut,\nUm,\nI feel as though,\nYou know,\nAs long as they save,\nYou know,\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place,\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all.\nUm,\nShould I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah um,\nAlright,\nWell,\nUm,\nHmm,\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh,\nExpress yourself,\nUm,\nA lot longer when you’re writing,\nBut,\nUm,\nLike what I was saying,\nIt is a public thing,\nUm,\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace,\nAnd,\nNot expecting to get in trouble,\nThat’s ridiculous,\nUm,\nEverything,\nLike I’m,\nUh,\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails,\nUm,\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email,\nBecause,\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up,\nAnd,\nYou know,\nEverything like,\nEverything nowadays comes back,\nAnd,\nYou know,\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say.\n\nUm,\nLike,\nYou know,\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow,\nAnd,\nLike,\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet,\nAnd,\nUm,\nYou know,\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it,\nYou will get in trouble,\nAnd,\nI don’t,\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy,\nBecause,\nYou know,\nLike I said before,\nAnd,\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing,\nAnd,\nUm,\nI don’t know,\nLet’s see here,\n\nUm,\nLike I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students,\nBut,\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place,\nUm,\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them,\nOr,\nUm,\nOther officials such as the police to go on,\nUm,\nYou know,\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though,\nYou know,\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place,\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm,\nA\nUh,\nTeacher of mine,\nI went to a public high school,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey say,\nYou know,\nWe have to ensure stuff like this,\nBecause,\nLike,\nWe would do like lock downs,\nAnd,\nStuff,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks,\nUh,\nWe had to be safe about that,\nWe had like drill stuff,\nAnd,\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting,\nBecause,\nUm,\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess,\nUm,\nSo we,\nYou know,\nWe did practice that stuff,\nUm,\nIn order to make the school a safer place,\nAnd,\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case,\nThey were just making it a safer place,\nUm,\nPreventing anything bad from happening,\nLike,\nColumbine or something like that,\nUm,\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with,\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was all for the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go over there and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, I believe we overlooked many aspects and didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went over there unprepared and without a clear plan, and I think it backfired on us. I don't know; I was all for it at first, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I think as long as they're fighting each other, they won't be fighting with us. I've almost lost interest in what happens over there due to 9/11. I don't care about their issues anymore. Sometimes I don't think they're human; they fight amongst themselves and can't do anything about it. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them than for us; they're savage when it comes to war, and I don't think they're trying to improve their country. I think they just want us to leave. I think we should just leave. We were more emotional and angry than rational about what this could lead to or how they would react. I think President Bush went to war because the people wanted to go. He declared war on Iraq, but he was coming from a place where we couldn't just let them do that and then rebuild. We couldn't have just let it go, but we could have had a better plan. We didn't have a clear goal in terms of creating order, and there was no unity. I think we were driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created in turn. I don't think we can change them, and I don't think they'll ever change. I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on for too long. We're not making enough progress to stay there. I think no matter how long we stay, it will collapse once we leave. We can't stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, I'm done."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. They have been discussing how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because, often, the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many issues. For instance, in the cases of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception, the Church has strong views, which is okay, but these views can seem old-fashioned at times. If the Church adapted to more modern thinking, it wouldn't be concerned with losing its following. I've heard that many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues and disagree with them on certain subjects. I feel that the Church's views on these matters are often incorrect. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not be comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage. I don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't believe these changes would have prevented what happened, although I don't know if they would have done things differently if priests could be married. It's hard to say for sure. I don't see why priests can't have both a family life and be devoted to their job, just like everyone else in the world.",

            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Basically, there is no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are numerous aspects to consider and it is fundamentally different, like two sides of the same coin. Many civil rights issues are at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where, for instance, a partner may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized loved one because they are not considered family.\n\nScientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same success rates in relationships and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The main issue is that people are hung up on the idea that same-sex couples are asking for church approval, but they are simply seeking legal recognition. If there is no religious involvement, this should not be an issue.\n\nPeople also worry about adoption and community impacts, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples face bullying in schools and may be treated differently. However, parenting skills are the same regardless of the parents' sexual orientation. Same-sex couples can be just as involved in their communities as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in every state. President Bush has strong religious views on this issue, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most reasons against same-sex marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among people. It is unethical to enforce one group's morality over others, especially considering recent controversies about religious phrases in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are against same-sex marriage due to the belief that gay people are psychologically damaged.

            "I was initially okay with the premise but everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think that we sort of went into Iraq as a pretext with various reasons leading us into Iraq. I think early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war frustrates me. It seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge that fact. Even Colin Powell, after his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. To me, that's just a breach of duty; I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, at least since September 11th. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. I forget the name of the Treasury Secretary who made that allegation in his book after being probably forced out of his office, but it seems that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with a fractious group of radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.",

            "I really don't feel like it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution, it's explicitly stated that there should be a separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be defying what's already been written in the constitution. So, I think that the people trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except for in Boston and some other areas. But I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches are allowed to make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right at all, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or society.",
            "The war in Iraq was not begun with full honesty by the government towards the American people concerning the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, the government did not provide clear explanations. The Iraq invasion was linked with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but in reality, there was not much connection between the two. However, the government leveraged the public's outrage against the 9/11 attacks to initiate the Iraq invasion in 2003. Personally, I am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The Iraq War is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that followed. The United States removed Iraq's government and attempted to establish a democratic government, similar to what was tried in Vietnam. The government should have known that this would be a long and difficult process, not a clear-cut victory. The same challenges exist today, with ongoing American casualties and efforts to train Iraqi forces to govern their own country. The government underestimated the complexity and duration of the task. The initial optimism that the Iraq intervention would be short and successful was naïve. The war in Iraq is a hard decision to make. During the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to see the task through, but it is difficult to abandon the people we displaced. The large number of American casualties and the costs of continuing the war also need to be considered. The stated reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is oil, as the United States is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil. The government's decision-making process regarding Iraq was not thorough enough, as it did not account for the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, despite knowing about such weapons in North Korea. I hope that the war ends soon and peace is restored, but it seems unlikely.",

            "To begin, I believe the war has been prolonged too long. Initially, the goal was commendable—to restore democracy in a country that lacked fair political systems. However, we seem to have lost sight of that original purpose. It now appears we are engaged in the conflict merely to demonstrate our global supremacy. When considering the past, the initial motivation was likely influenced by George Bush's father's unresolved disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was genuinely to establish democracy in a country suffering under a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, over time, this purpose has been obscured, and our actions have become misguided. We appear to be at war to maintain the status quo of conflict. Additionally, the war has stretched on for too long. The local government should now be capable of managing their own affairs. Our economy is being drained by this prolonged conflict, and we have our own critical issues, such as poverty and infrastructure needs, that desperately require funding. The money spent on this war could be more effectively allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns. It's high time we end this war.",
            "Can I ask a question that clarifies that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like...\n\nO ok, um, no, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone’s profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that, but if you’ve accepted them as your friend, you’ve given them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that’s tough. Because, I mean, obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.” Um, I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on what situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people’s profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just proved how he could get information so easily. He went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it’s hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much, so it’s a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I think I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "Um\nYes, I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it's not just women. It has to do with the particular field of work you're in.\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, where even if there's supposed to be equality, most people have difficulty working under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world.\nAnd the same thing goes for men, like in the fashion industry or being a parent at home. It's really uncommon to have a parent staying at home who's male, and a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, \"Well, you're the male, you should be out working. You should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\"\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that.\nAnd in the fashion industry, a lot of times people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males in fashion have different styles of life. So if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like, you don't really know what our case is like, like these other guys.\"\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds, but change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now—because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world—it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\"\nAnd for fashion people, they will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" So they do know where I'm coming from.\nSo, I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against. Not too pushy, but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo, I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself to work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world. Other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"\nSo, yeah.\nSo, like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender.\nI don't know.\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; they decriminalized it. It knocked it down from a criminal offense to something like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked, arrested, and brought in for all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean so, I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons. But there’s this whole, like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like, why it shouldn’t necessarily well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and in a lot of contexts. Uh, to smoke marijuana so to have it out in the open like that I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know. Um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no I don’t",
            "Yes, I would say so.\nBecause\nWell\nMany of their actions are quite traditional,\nThey’ve been doing the same things for a long time,\nAnd it’s beneficial to be rooted in traditions,\nBut it’s also crucial to be adaptable to change.\nI suppose\nA lot of Catholics believe they must attend church every week,\nAnd they are quite strict about how things are done,\nAnd sometimes\nI feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t adhere strictly to the doctrine,\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t perfect Catholics,\nAnd they also reject those of other religions,\nFor instance,\nMy parents,\nMy dad was an Episcopalian, and my mom was a Catholic,\nThey wouldn’t marry them in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion,\nThat’s not being tolerant of other religions,\nWe were always taught to love others,\nThat’s a Catholic teaching,\nBut it’s hypocritical to preach love and then not accept them in this way,\nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do certain things,\nBut the Catholic practice goes against it,\nBecause it’s so outdated,\nBut they still continue with it.\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it,\nI mean,\nI personally believe it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry,\nBut I don’t think that would necessarily stop them from committing pedophilic acts,\nIt’s a different realm,\nUm\nI don’t think it would be an issue,\nWell\nI guess\nPeople who molest children,\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not,\nBecause it’s children which is different from a spouse,\nSo if you’re going to do something like that,\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married,\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nThose things from happening,\nI think that would probably happen regardless.\n\nNope",
            "我\n还没有做出决定\n我还没有搞清楚这个问题\n所以\n我还不能说哪边对哪边错\n因为\n这个问题太复杂了\n因为\n它离宗教和国家之间的分离这么近\n以及\n如何定义婚姻是一个非常困难的事情\n不会冒犯到任何人\n所以\n我还没有想清楚\n我还没有想清楚\n所有的民事同性婚姻\n我不确定婚姻应该如何看待\n以及\n像\n由政府定义\n看到它作为一个圣礼\n人们不会得到税收优惠\n或者\n在政府眼中被特别对待，如果他们是被洗礼的\n所以\n如果你结婚了，我想政府应该把它看作是民事同性婚姻\n因为\n这就是它的本质\n它是两个人\n他们不应该有宗教和国家之间的分离\n他们不应该被问及这是哪种婚姻\n两个人结合在一起\n所以\n以及\n同性婚姻\n我意思是\n这两个人结合在一起\n\n嗯\n如果所有的州能够达成一个合理的结论\n那么他们应该推动把它变成联邦法\n但是\n宪法修正案禁止同性婚姻简直荒谬\n因为\n宪法不应该因为一些事情而被修改\n我意思是\n这对某些人来说是一个很大的原因\n但是\n它不大到足以成为宪法修正案\n\n它并不重要到需要修改宪法\n来定义\n禁止同性婚姻\n简单来说\n\n嗯\n不",
            "I was raised in a Christian family, so I have a complicated view of homosexuality. I have many gay friends and I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by each individual state. It's a matter of personal choice and I don't see how the president, whether Republican or Democratic, should impose their views on the whole country. Instead, states should have the freedom to decide based on their own values and preferences. It's not up to the president to make this decision for everyone. The issue should be handled at the state level to respect the diversity of opinions and beliefs within our country.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t think so.\nUm\nLet me see.\nThe way I see it,\nMyspace is a public thing,\nIt’s a bulletin board,\nYou know?\nIf you look up the definition,\nUm,\nIt basically means to post for the public to see,\nOr for others to see,\nUm,\nWhatever you’re trying to get across.\nAnd,\nIf you post that on the internet,\nUm,\nYou know,\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that,\nWhether they’re school officials or not,\nUm,\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that,\nThey had every right to see it,\nBecause,\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name,\nThey could have still accessed that,\nUh,\nThrough their homes,\nUm,\nBut uh,\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting,\nYou know,\nAs long as it saves the lives of,\nUh,\nStudents,\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system,\nI think that,\nUh,\nThat’s perfectly fine.\nUm,\nLet me see here,\nLike,\nUm,\nYou know,\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if,\nYou know,\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they’re not supposed to be doing,\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students,\nAnd,\nTo get them in trouble,\nAnd,\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy,\nBut,\nUm,\nI feel as though,\nYou know,\nAs long as they save,\nYou know,\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place,\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all.\nUm,\nShould I elaborate more on that?\n\nYeah um,\nAlright,\nWell,\nUm,\nHmm,\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh,\nExpress yourself,\nUm,\nA lot longer when you’re writing,\nBut,\nUm,\nLike what I was saying,\nIt is a public thing,\nUm,\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace,\nAnd,\nNot expecting to get in trouble,\nThat’s ridiculous,\nUm,\nEverything,\nLike I’m,\nUh,\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails,\nUm,\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email,\nBecause,\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up,\nAnd,\nYou know,\nEverything like,\nEverything nowadays comes back,\nAnd,\nYou know,\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say.\n\nUm,\nLike,\nYou know,\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow,\nAnd,\nLike,\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet,\nAnd,\nUm,\nYou know,\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it,\nYou will get in trouble,\nAnd,\nI don’t,\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy,\nBecause,\nYou know,\nLike I said before,\nAnd,\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing,\nAnd,\nUm,\nI don’t know,\nLet’s see here,\n\nUm,\nLike I had said before, I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students,\nBut,\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place,\nUm,\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them,\nOr,\nUm,\nOther officials such as the police to go on,\nUm,\nYou know,\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though,\nYou know,\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place,\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm,\nA\nUh,\nTeacher of mine,\nI went to a public high school,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThey say,\nYou know,\nWe have to ensure stuff like this,\nBecause,\nLike,\nWe would do like lock downs,\nAnd,\nStuff,\nAnd,\nUm,\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks,\nUh,\nWe had to be safe about that,\nWe had like drill stuff,\nAnd,\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting,\nBecause,\nUm,\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess,\nUm,\nSo we,\nYou know,\nWe did practice that stuff,\nUm,\nIn order to make the school a safer place,\nAnd,\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case,\nThey were just making it a safer place,\nUm,\nPreventing anything bad from happening,\nLike,\nColumbine or something like that,\nUm,\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with,\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was all for the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go over there and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, I believe we overlooked many aspects and didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went over there unprepared and without a clear plan, and I think it backfired on us. I don't know; I was all for it at first, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I think as long as they're fighting each other, they won't be fighting with us. I've almost lost interest in what happens over there due to 9/11. I don't care about their issues anymore. Sometimes I don't think they're human; they fight amongst themselves and can't do anything about it. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them than for us; they're savage when it comes to war, and I don't think they're trying to improve their country. I think they just want us to leave. I think we should just leave. We were more emotional and angry than rational about what this could lead to or how they would react. I think President Bush went to war because the people wanted to go. He declared war on Iraq, but he was coming from a place where we couldn't just let them do that and then rebuild. We couldn't have just let it go, but we could have had a better plan. We didn't have a clear goal in terms of creating order, and there was no unity. I think we were driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created in turn. I don't think we can change them, and I don't think they'll ever change. I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on for too long. We're not making enough progress to stay there. I think no matter how long we stay, it will collapse once we leave. We can't stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, I'm done."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. They have been discussing how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because, often, the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of many issues. For instance, in the cases of gay marriage, abortion, and contraception, the Church has strong views, which is okay, but these views can seem old-fashioned at times. If the Church adapted to more modern thinking, it wouldn't be concerned with losing its following. I've heard that many people are turning against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues and disagree with them on certain subjects. I feel that the Church's views on these matters are often incorrect. For example, if someone supports abortion, they might not be comfortable in a church that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage. I don't see why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married. I don't believe these changes would have prevented what happened, although I don't know if they would have done things differently if priests could be married. It's hard to say for sure. I don't see why priests can't have both a family life and be devoted to their job, just like everyone else in the world.",

            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. Basically, there is no compelling reason not to. Many people worry that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are numerous aspects to consider and it is fundamentally different, like two sides of the same coin. Many civil rights issues are at stake, such as property taxes and healthcare, where, for instance, a partner may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized loved one because they are not considered family.\n\nScientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same success rates in relationships and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The main issue is that people are hung up on the idea that same-sex couples are asking for church approval, but they are simply seeking legal recognition. If there is no religious involvement, this should not be an issue.\n\nPeople also worry about adoption and community impacts, but these concerns are unfounded. Children of same-sex couples face bullying in schools and may be treated differently. However, parenting skills are the same regardless of the parents' sexual orientation. Same-sex couples can be just as involved in their communities as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in every state. President Bush has strong religious views on this issue, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. Most reasons against same-sex marriage are based on morality, which varies greatly among people. It is unethical to enforce one group's morality over others, especially considering recent controversies about religious phrases in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nMany people are against same-sex marriage due to the belief that gay people are psychologically damaged. However, this is not supported by research from institutions like the American Psychological Association. People should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or cultural beliefs.",

            "I was initially okay with the premise but everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think that we sort of went into Iraq as a pretext with various reasons leading us into Iraq. I think early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since been proven false. This really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war frustrates me. It seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to acknowledge that fact. Even Colin Powell, after his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. To me, that's just a breach of duty; I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, at least since September 11th. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. I forget the name of the Treasury Secretary who made that allegation in his book after being probably forced out of his office, but it seems that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration, and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue. A major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we’re still dealing with a fractious group of radical elements who are vying for control of the government.

            "I really don't feel like it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the churches, because in the constitution, it's explicitly stated that there should be a separation of church and state. It's clearly stated, and I feel that trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be defying what's already been written in the constitution. So, I think that the people trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another, because, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except for in Boston and some other areas. But I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches are allowed to make illegal or legal. Separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution and what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about it would be right at all, and I don't see how it would impact the economy or society.",
            "The war in Iraq was not begun with full honesty by the government towards the American people concerning the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, the government did not provide clear explanations. The Iraq invasion was linked with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but in reality, there was not much connection between the two. However, the government leveraged the public's outrage against the 9/11 attacks to initiate the Iraq invasion in 2003. Personally, I am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The Iraq War is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes. A significant number of American soldiers have died, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that followed. The United States removed Iraq's government and attempted to establish a democratic government, similar to what was tried in Vietnam. The government should have known that this would be a long and difficult process, not a clear-cut victory. The same challenges exist today, with ongoing American casualties and efforts to train Iraqi forces to govern their own country. The government underestimated the complexity and duration of the task. The initial optimism that the Iraq intervention would be short and successful was naïve. The war in Iraq is a hard decision to make. During the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to see the task through, but it is difficult to abandon the people we displaced. The large number of American casualties and the costs of continuing the war also need to be considered. The stated reason for invading Iraq was to make it a democratic nation, but why not do the same for other countries? The main reason is oil, as the United States is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil. The government's decision-making process regarding Iraq was not thorough enough, as it did not account for the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq, despite knowing about such weapons in North Korea.

            "When you post something online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this. Whatever you put out there will influence people's opinions of you. If you talk about harmful activities like blowing things up or shootings, people will take notice, and if the school gets involved, they must take action. If something serious is posted, even if it was meant as a joke, it could be taken seriously by the school. There's no invasion of privacy if you've made something public. If you don't want it seen or certain thoughts about you to be known, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret what you share. I don't think school officials should friend students on these platforms, but if something concerning is reported, they must act. It's the responsibility of those who use such platforms to be aware of privacy laws and to report any dangerous content.",
            "To begin, I believe the war has been prolonged too long. Initially, the goal was commendable—to restore democracy in a country that lacked fair political systems. However, we seem to have lost sight of that original purpose. It now appears we are engaged in the conflict merely to demonstrate our global supremacy. When considering the past, the initial motivation was likely influenced by George Bush's father's unresolved disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was genuinely to establish democracy in a country suffering under a tyrant, that would be a just cause. However, over time, this purpose has been obscured, and our actions have become misguided. We appear to be at war to maintain the status quo of conflict. Additionally, the war has stretched on for too long. The local government should now be capable of managing their own affairs. Our economy is being drained by this prolonged conflict, and we have our own critical issues, such as poverty and infrastructure needs, that desperately require funding. The money spent on this war could be more effectively allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns. It's high time we end this war.",
            "Can I ask a question that clarifies that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like...\n\nO ok, um, no, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy. On sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone’s profile. You might need to be their friend or something like that, but if you’ve accepted them as your friend, you’ve given them permission to see your profile. So anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that. So if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum, um, that’s tough. Because, I mean, obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.” Um, I mean, I don’t think it would really be right to have someone’s job be to look at people’s profiles. But it all depends on what situation they came across that profile or if someone was just randomly looking at people’s profiles and just randomly happened to see that or if they were actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\n\nSure, um, well, like, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook. I do. It bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just proved how he could get information so easily. He went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute and got her to meet with him. And personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone, but I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it’s me. And it’s hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you. All sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends. I don’t want to limit it too much, so it’s a tricky issue. Because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really who can look at what.\n\nHum, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school. And that struck me as a little bit strange. Like, I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I think I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and one more time I need to talk about the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean I feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean I hate to say you know\nI hate to join the bandwagon of people who are like oh I was against it from the beginning\nUm\nI was but like it’s not really important anymore\nBecause just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean you just have to look at like the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve done United States polls\nThey’ve done Iraqi polls\nThey’ve done global polls\nAnd I mean no one\nAbout seventy five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops that are over there\nLike the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in\nIt was already a disaster\nAnd now pulling out is also going to be a disaster\nThere’s really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nJust the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states\nI mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations\nAnd they think that they can just like bring Democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist\nLike that’s not the way that\nUm\nThis totally different group of people would choose to run their lives\nI mean sure Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not\nBut, I mean you have to weight the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to\nYou know turn into just a complete disaster\nJust like quick sand from when we went over there\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t really see a reason at all to stay in there\nUm\nI mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there\nUm\nAnd you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out\nI don’t agree with them\nI’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should\nUm\nI mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year\nUm\nI guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that\nBut, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now\nUm\nI mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now\nAnd like these\nThese are the people that we’re trying to save like that we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nYou know I think they might know better than that\nAnd at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens\nYou know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to\nUm\nAnd then you know at least we’ll\nI mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys\nKind of\nNot really, no\nWe’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, you know\nIt’ll be better than you know where we are\nWhere we stand right now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Um\nYes, I feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it's not just women. It has to do with the particular field of work you're in.\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it harder because there's the glass ceiling, where even if there's supposed to be equality, most people have difficulty working under a woman if they're a man, just because of how society has been raised for so long.\nAnd so, a lot of times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for it, but maybe the board won't promote them to that position just because historically it's not seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world.\nAnd the same thing goes for men, like in the fashion industry or being a parent at home. It's really uncommon to have a parent staying at home who's male, and a lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks, \"Well, you're the male, you should be out working. You should be the money maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\"\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it's always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job, and it's working out fine for them, but society looks down upon that.\nAnd in the fashion industry, a lot of times people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I don't know if that makes sense, but I guess it's because typically males in fashion have different styles of life. So if you have the typical style of life and you're a male and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for a woman? Like, you don't really know what our case is like, like these other guys.\"\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and obviously, we've come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds, but change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now—because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they're getting more accepted in the business world—it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works.\"\nAnd for fashion people, they will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their friends that are females or their wives and stuff.\" So they do know where I'm coming from.\nSo, I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against. Not too pushy, but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it, people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.\nSo, I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist.\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself to work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world. Other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"\nSo, yeah.\nSo, like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender.\nI don't know.\nI guess that'd be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; they decriminalized it. It knocked it down from a criminal offense to something like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked, arrested, and brought in for all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited for it, then for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well, at least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and to house them and then to let them go. And then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times and then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine and I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean so, I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons. But there’s this whole, like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like, why it shouldn’t necessarily well no, I mean I don’t know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and in a lot of contexts. Uh, to smoke marijuana so to have it out in the open like that I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know. Um, I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean, but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah, uh, no I don’t",

            "Initially, I was all for the war because I was personally affected by 9/11. I wanted to go over there and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, I believe we overlooked many aspects and didn't consider the long-term consequences. We went over there unprepared and without a clear plan, and I think it backfired on us. I don't know; I was all for it at first, but now I'm strongly against it. I don't think it accomplished anything. I think as long as they're fighting each other, they won't be fighting with us. I've almost lost interest in what happens over there due to 9/11. I don't care about their issues anymore. Sometimes I don't think they're human; they fight amongst themselves and can't do anything about it. We definitely went over there unprepared, not knowing what to expect. War is different for them than for us; they're savage when it comes to war, and I don't think they're trying to improve their country. I think they just want us to leave. I think we should just leave. We were more emotional and angry than rational about what this could lead to or how they would react. I think President Bush went to war because the people wanted to go. He declared war on Iraq, but he was coming from a place where we couldn't just let them do that and then rebuild. We couldn't have just let it go, but we could have had a better plan. We didn't have a clear goal in terms of creating order, and there was no unity. I think we were driven by emotion and anger, and that's what we created in turn. I don't think we can change them, and I don't think they'll ever change. I really don't have anything else to say. It's gone on for too long. We're not making enough progress to stay there. I think no matter how long we stay, it will collapse once we leave. We can't stay there forever, and I think we're hurting ourselves by staying there. No, I'm done."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um, I believe the Catholic Church needs to change in several ways. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's because they are not accepting of many things. For example, they have strong views against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are quite outdated. If they adapted to more modern views, they might not worry about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues, as they don't agree with these views. For instance, if you support abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a following that disapproves of these things. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the decline in followers. However, I believe priests should be able to have both a devoted life to God and a family life, just like everyone else with a job.",

It's like saying heads and tails are the same, but they're not.\nThere are civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a same-sex partner may not have the same rights as a spouse in a straight marriage.\n\nAdditionally, scientific research shows that same-sex couples are just as capable of maintaining successful relationships as opposite-sex couples.\nThe debate often revolves around the right to marry in a church, but same-sex couples are simply seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIt's essential to separate church and state in this matter. If you're allowing civil unions, why not legalize same-sex marriage?\nThis is akin to segregation, and same-sex couples are often treated unequally.\nThere are concerns about adoption and the impact on communities, but these fears are unfounded.\nChildren of same-sex couples are no different from children of straight couples, and their upbringing is influenced by their parents' personality choices, not their sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.\nPresident Bush has strong personal beliefs about same-sex marriage, influenced by his religion.\nHowever, morality is subjective and varies among individuals.\nIt's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the rest of the country without considering cultural and moral diversity.\nThe government's stance on same-sex marriage is hypocritical, given the recent controversies over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are against same-sex marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage and trauma in childhood.\nThe American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, but some people still rely on outdated beliefs and popular opinions rather than scientific research.",

            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still recovering from the shock of September 11th. I believe we went into Iraq under the guise of finding a pretext, with the Iraq war being connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and the Bush administration asserting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know to be false. That really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. Um, it seems to me that the Bush administration outright lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for that. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war. Um, I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his position, but it seems like the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration, and in the long term, he was hoping to secure more energy supplies, which is quite underhanded. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough. I do think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war and more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative being considered now, where the UN and the United States are moving towards, is a coalition of nations from the surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as in the long term, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. A lot of news reports suggest that the interim government is dissolving at this point, and the Parliament doesn't seem to be very effective. There's a lot of friction in the political process due to this. Um, none of this can be expressed in polite company.",

            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nFrom the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war in Iraq. I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they had little connection. However, the government made it seem otherwise, playing on the emotions of the American people following the September 11th attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself am generally against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is in many ways a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the tremendous loss of American soldiers, which is horrendous. The government did not seem prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to install a democratic one, similar to the efforts in Vietnam to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, the government should have known that such a task would be long and difficult, not a clear victory like the one in Vietnam.\n\nYou're not fighting an actual army; you're fighting the citizens of the country. I think the government should not have gotten involved in the war to begin with. But if you do, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They didn't plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there today, at the end of 2006, many American troops are still dying, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. This is a long process, and I think the government made it seem like a short, successful stay. In reality, it takes years to implement a new form of government and to make it successful, as it did in our own country.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. I wouldn't have voted for George Bush in the 2004 presidential election, but I would have hoped he would finish what he started. Once we go in, we can't abandon the people. It's too much to ask for us to leave them now. We should try to finish what we started, but there's also the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace, but probably not.",
            "I support same-sex marriage. I've always been. I believe it's a personal preference and it's been shown to be more of a biological inclination than a sociological one. So, I don't think people should have their rights taken away because of something they can't control. It seems inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think politics and government should have any part in this. It's a personal and household level issue. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street like anyone else does. I think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to interpret marriage in his own way.\n\nYes, I mean, I've read and heard numerous reports and heard from different sources that it's something that might be predisposed to in your brain, as opposed to growing up with certain family dynamics. So that would be the biological side opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, besides the obvious, I think it's because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing rather than a public or national domain.",
            "When you post something online, it's a public forum. It's entirely public. You can't control what others think about you.

Once something is out there, it can influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's something like talking about physical violence. Online, anything you say might be taken seriously by others. Even if you're just joking. Schools have strict protocols when someone posts something concerning. They can't ignore it, just in case something serious happens. However, not everything should be taken seriously. Some people do post things as jokes. But if something is brought to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. The school should not monitor students' social media accounts, but if a student posts something dangerous, the school has to act. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else brings it to their attention. Teachers should not create fake accounts to friend students. If a student posts something dangerous, the school should not ignore it. It's not up to me to know if my residents are drinking and posting pictures online. I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like the war has been prolonged far too much. Initially, I thought the purpose was good—to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've lost sight of this goal. Now, it seems we're fighting for the sake of it, to prove our power. The original motivation might have been questionable due to George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, it was justifiable. However, I think we’ve now lost our original cause. We should have achieved our purpose within the first couple of months, but the war has dragged on for over a year. I think it’s been prolonged enough. Our reason for continuing the war has deteriorated and been misconceived; it seems like we’re still fighting just to fight. We don’t want to end the war without a decisive victory. The war has gone on long enough. I believe Iraq's government should now take care of itself. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions on this war while we have our own issues at home, like poverty and education. War is not sustainable for the long term. Instead of spending money on a foreign war, we should focus on our own internal improvements, such as public roads, schools, and healthcare.",

            "Hmm, uh, we only have this chance and one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Um, yeah, I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it. I mean, I hate to say, you know, I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was, but it's not really important anymore. And, um, the general consensus everywhere is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done U.S. polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between, like, the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap, and for like this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think that they can just like bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's like arguing that he's not, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand from when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And, like these, these are the people that we're trying to save like that we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, you know, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Um, yeah, uh, no.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nNot only is it a problem with women, but also in certain fields of work.\nOverall, I think women have a harder time because of the glass ceiling; even with equal opportunities, many people struggle to work under a woman, just due to societal norms.\nMen, too, face discrimination in fields like fashion or in staying at home as a parent.\nSociety often looks down on men staying home, assuming they should be the breadwinners.\nIn the fashion industry, men, especially straight ones, may not be taken seriously, as society might question their knowledge about fashion, assuming they don't understand women's perspectives.\nDepending on the field of work, there is indeed gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nChanging this is challenging because societal mindsets are set, but progress is being made.\nWomen are taking on higher positions and becoming CEOs, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted.\nTo address these issues, we need to promote good qualities of those stereotyped against, not by being pushy, but by highlighting their qualities.\nSociety is at a balance where this is more enforced, so we don't need to rush the change.\nYes, people also face discrimination based on their job type or where they come from.\nFor example, someone from a farm with poor grammar but high intelligence may face discrimination from other men who assume they're not truly what they seem.\nYes, I guess that's another example of how gender and background can cause discrimination.\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you might get cited for rather than booked and arrested. I believe that if someone gets caught and cited for it, the consequences could still affect job interviews and other aspects of life, just like a drug charge. The worst ramifications of a drug charge usually involve being jailed, and the costs of prosecuting and incarcerating people are substantial. When municipalities are facing financial difficulties, many are reluctant to make these changes, even if it could free up funds for other programs. In Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, this change is seen more favorably. The municipality has more money to spend on education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. I think it's important to consider these factors, as marijuana shouldn't be widespread on the streets. It's not something that should be legalized to the extent that it's sold in gas stations and smoked openly. It's still taboo in many places and contexts. I'm not sure how I feel about legalization because it could lead to people smoking it while driving. Marijuana and alcohol both have adverse effects on people, and the impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people can handle substances well, while others cannot. It's difficult to generalize about substances because they affect people differently. However, both have their own adverse effects. I don't know.",

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "Um, I believe the Catholic Church needs to change in several ways. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's because they are not accepting of many things. For example, they have strong views against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are quite outdated. If they adapted to more modern views, they might not worry about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues, as they don't agree with these views. For instance, if you support abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a following that disapproves of these things. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the decline in followers. However, I believe priests should be able to have both a devoted life to God and a family life, just like everyone else with a job.",

It's like saying heads and tails are the same, but they're not.\nThere are civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a same-sex partner may not have the same rights as a spouse in a straight marriage.\n\nAdditionally, scientific research shows that same-sex couples are just as capable of maintaining successful relationships as opposite-sex couples.\nThe debate often revolves around the right to marry in a church, but same-sex couples are simply seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIt's essential to separate church and state in this matter. If you're allowing civil unions, why not legalize same-sex marriage?\nThis is akin to segregation, and same-sex couples are often treated unequally.\nThere are concerns about adoption and the impact on communities, but these fears are unfounded.\nChildren of same-sex couples are no different from children of straight couples, and their upbringing is influenced by their parents' personality choices, not their sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.\nPresident Bush has strong personal beliefs about same-sex marriage, influenced by his religion.\nHowever, morality is subjective and varies among individuals.\nIt's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the rest of the country without considering cultural and moral diversity.\nThe government's stance on same-sex marriage is hypocritical, given the recent controversies over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are against same-sex marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage and trauma in childhood.\nThe American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, but some people still rely on outdated beliefs and popular opinions rather than scientific research.",

            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still recovering from the shock of September 11th. I believe we went into Iraq under the guise of finding a pretext, with the Iraq war being connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and the Bush administration asserting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know to be false. That really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. Um, it seems to me that the Bush administration outright lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for that. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war. Um, I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his position, but it seems like the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration, and in the long term, he was hoping to secure more energy supplies, which is quite underhanded. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough. I do think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war and more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative being considered now, where the UN and the United States are moving towards, is a coalition of nations from the surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as in the long term, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. A lot of news reports suggest that the interim government is dissolving at this point, and the Parliament doesn't seem to be very effective. There's a lot of friction in the political process due to this. Um, none of this can be expressed in polite company.",

            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nFrom the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war in Iraq. I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they had little connection. However, the government made it seem otherwise, playing on the emotions of the American people following the September 11th attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself am generally against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is in many ways a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the tremendous loss of American soldiers, which is horrendous. The government did not seem prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to install a democratic one, similar to the efforts in Vietnam to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, the government should have known that such a task would be long and difficult, not a clear victory like the one in Vietnam.\n\nYou're not fighting an actual army; you're fighting the citizens of the country. I think the government should not have gotten involved in the war to begin with. But if you do, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They didn't plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there today, at the end of 2006, many American troops are still dying, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. This is a long process, and I think the government made it seem like a short, successful stay. In reality, it takes years to implement a new form of government and to make it successful, as it did in our own country.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. I wouldn't have voted for George Bush in the 2004 presidential election, but I would have hoped he would finish what he started. Once we go in, we can't abandon the people. It's too much to ask for us to leave them now. We should try to finish what we started, but there's also the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace, but probably not.",
            "I support same-sex marriage. I've always been. I believe it's a personal preference and it's been shown to be more of a biological inclination than a sociological one. So, I don't think people should have their rights taken away because of something they can't control. It seems inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think politics and government should have any part in this. It's a personal and household level issue. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street like anyone else does. I think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to interpret marriage in his own way.\n\nYes, I mean, I've read and heard numerous reports and heard from different sources that it's something that might be predisposed to in your brain, as opposed to growing up with certain family dynamics. So that would be the biological side opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, besides the obvious, I think it's because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing rather than a public or national domain.",
            "When you post something online, it's a public forum. It's entirely public. You can't control what others think about you. For example, as a Resident Advisor (R.A.), I've had to deal with this. Once something is out there, it can influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's something like talking about physical violence. Online, anything you say might be taken seriously by others. Even if you're just joking. Schools have strict protocols when someone posts something concerning. They can't ignore it, just in case something serious happens. However, not everything should be taken seriously. Some people do post things as jokes. But if something is brought to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. The school should not monitor students' social media accounts, but if a student posts something dangerous, the school has to act. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else brings it to their attention. Teachers should not create fake accounts to friend students. If a student posts something dangerous, the school should not ignore it. It's not up to me to know if my residents are drinking and posting pictures online. I don't want that kind of connection.",
            "I feel like the war has been prolonged far too much. Initially, I thought the purpose was good—to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've lost sight of this goal. Now, it seems we're fighting for the sake of it, to prove our power. The original motivation might have been questionable due to George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, it was justifiable. However, I think we’ve now lost our original cause. We should have achieved our purpose within the first couple of months, but the war has dragged on for over a year. I think it’s been prolonged enough. Our reason for continuing the war has deteriorated and been misconceived; it seems like we’re still fighting just to fight. We don’t want to end the war without a decisive victory. The war has gone on long enough. I believe Iraq's government should now take care of itself. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions on this war while we have our own issues at home, like poverty and education. War is not sustainable for the long term. Instead of spending money on a foreign war, we should focus on our own internal improvements, such as public roads, schools, and healthcare.",

            "Hmm, uh, we only have this chance and one more time to talk about the Iraq War. Um, yeah, I mean, I feel hypocritical talking about it. I mean, I hate to say, you know, I hate to jump on the bandwagon of people who say, \"I was against it from the beginning.\" I was, but it's not really important anymore. And, um, the general consensus everywhere is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done U.S. polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between, like, the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap, and for like this administration or previous administrations to understand. And they think that they can just like bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, I don't think anyone's like arguing that he's not, but you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, just like quicksand from when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And, like these, these are the people that we're trying to save like that we're trying to help. Telling us to leave. Um, you know, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll at least be the good guys. Kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Um, yeah, uh, no.",
            "I feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States.\nNot only is it a problem with women, but also in certain fields of work.\nOverall, I think women have a harder time because of the glass ceiling; even with equal opportunities, many people struggle to work under a woman, just due to societal norms.\nMen, too, face discrimination in fields like fashion or in staying at home as a parent.\nSociety often looks down on men staying home, assuming they should be the breadwinners.\nIn the fashion industry, men, especially straight ones, may not be taken seriously, as society might question their knowledge about fashion, assuming they don't understand women's perspectives.\nDepending on the field of work, there is indeed gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nChanging this is challenging because societal mindsets are set, but progress is being made.\nWomen are taking on higher positions and becoming CEOs, and men staying at home is becoming more accepted.\nTo address these issues, we need to promote good qualities of those stereotyped against, not by being pushy, but by highlighting their qualities.\nSociety is at a balance where this is more enforced, so we don't need to rush the change.\nYes, people also face discrimination based on their job type or where they come from.\nFor example, someone from a farm with poor grammar but high intelligence may face discrimination from other men who assume they're not truly what they seem.\nYes, I guess that's another example of how gender and background can cause discrimination.\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you might get cited for rather than booked and arrested. I believe that if someone gets caught and cited for it, the consequences could still affect job interviews and other aspects of life, just like a drug charge. The worst ramifications of a drug charge usually involve being jailed, and the costs of prosecuting and incarcerating people are substantial. When municipalities are facing financial difficulties, many are reluctant to make these changes, even if it could free up funds for other programs. In Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, this change is seen more favorably. The municipality has more money to spend on education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. I think it's important to consider these factors, as marijuana shouldn't be widespread on the streets. It's not something that should be legalized to the extent that it's sold in gas stations and smoked openly. It's still taboo in many places and contexts. I'm not sure how I feel about legalization because it could lead to people smoking it while driving. Marijuana and alcohol both have adverse effects on people, and the impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people can handle substances well, while others cannot. It's difficult to generalize about substances because they affect people differently. However, both have their own adverse effects. I don't know.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "Um, I believe the Catholic Church needs to change in several ways. They have been discussing the decline in their following, and I think it's because they are not accepting of many things. For example, they have strong views against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which are quite outdated. If they adapted to more modern views, they might not worry about losing their followers. Many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their stance on these issues, as they don't agree with these views. For instance, if you support abortion or gay marriage, you might not feel comfortable in a following that disapproves of these things. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or allow priests to be married, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the decline in followers. However, I believe priests should be able to have both a devoted life to God and a family life, just like everyone else with a job.",
            "I’m not opposed to gay marriage. I think that people, whether they are born that way or whatever, shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it’s wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can’t really. I don’t think the federal government should be involved because it’s not a legal issue or a moral issue. It just seems like they’re out of place. It doesn’t seem like they have any right to interject in people’s lives. And I mean, that’s just who they are. The federal government shouldn’t be involved.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized.\nThere is no compelling reason not to.\nMany people view same-sex couples as a threat to the traditional heterosexual family, but this view is shortsighted.\nHomosexual relationships are distinct, and the analogy of two sides of the same coin isn't apt. It's like saying heads and tails are the same, but they're not.\nThere are civil rights at stake here, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a same-sex partner may not have the same rights as a spouse in a straight marriage.\n\nAdditionally, scientific research shows that same-sex couples are just as capable of maintaining successful relationships as opposite-sex couples.\nThe debate often revolves around the right to marry in a church, but same-sex couples are simply seeking a legal marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIt's essential to separate church and state in this matter. If you're allowing civil unions, why not legalize same-sex marriage?\nThis is akin to segregation, and same-sex couples are often treated unequally.\nThere are concerns about adoption and the impact on communities, but these fears are unfounded.\nChildren of same-sex couples are no different from children of straight couples, and their upbringing is influenced by their parents' personality choices, not their sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.\nPresident Bush has strong personal beliefs about same-sex marriage, influenced by his religion.\nHowever, morality is subjective and varies among individuals.\nIt's unethical to impose the morality of one group on the rest of the country without considering cultural and moral diversity.\nThe government's stance on same-sex marriage is hypocritical, given the recent controversies over the pledge of allegiance.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are against same-sex marriage due to misconceptions about psychological damage and trauma in childhood.\nThe American Psychological Association has debunked these claims, but some people still rely on outdated beliefs and popular opinions rather than scientific research.",

            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still recovering from the shock of September 11th. I believe we went into Iraq under the guise of finding a pretext, with the Iraq war being connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and the Bush administration asserting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know to be false. That really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just boils my blood. Um, it seems to me that the Bush administration outright lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for that. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, that's a clear case of malfeasance in office, an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th, at least. I think they came into office with the intention of going to war. Um, I can't remember the name of the Treasury Secretary who made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his position, but it seems like the younger Bush had a vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his dad's administration, and in the long term, he was hoping to secure more energy supplies, which is quite underhanded. Well, I do think it's gone on long enough. I do think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, as there's a good chance the country would descend into civil war and more people would die as a result. Um, I think the alternative being considered now, where the UN and the United States are moving towards, is a coalition of nations from the surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and restore order. But I'm not sure that's a good idea either, as in the long term, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. A lot of news reports suggest that the interim government is dissolving at this point, and the Parliament doesn't seem to be very effective. There's a lot of friction in the political process due to this. Um, none of this can be expressed in polite company.",

            "I honestly don't feel it's appropriate to make it legal or for a state to even declare it legal.

            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nFrom the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war in Iraq. I believe there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the September 11th terrorist attacks, but in reality, they had little connection. However, the government made it seem otherwise, playing on the emotions of the American people following the September 11th attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself am generally against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is in many ways a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the tremendous loss of American soldiers, which is horrendous. The government did not seem prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would occur. The United States was removing the Iraqi government and trying to install a democratic one, similar to the efforts in Vietnam to push out Communists and implement democracy. However, the government should have known that such a task would be long and difficult, not a clear victory like the one in Vietnam.\n\nYou're not fighting an actual army; you're fighting the citizens of the country. I think the government should not have gotten involved in the war to begin with. But if you do, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I believe the government was not as prepared as it should have been. They didn't plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We're still there today, at the end of 2006, many American troops are still dying, and we're still trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. This is a long process, and I think the government made it seem like a short, successful stay. In reality, it takes years to implement a new form of government and to make it successful, as it did in our own country.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. I wouldn't have voted for George Bush in the 2004 presidential election, but I would have hoped he would finish what he started. Once we go in, we can't abandon the people. It's too much to ask for us to leave them now. We should try to finish what we started, but there's also the consideration of the American casualties. How much is too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace, but probably not.",
            "I support same-sex marriage. I've always been. I believe it's a personal preference and it's been shown to be more of a biological inclination than a sociological one. So, I don't think people should have their rights taken away because of something they can't control. It seems inhumane to me. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think politics and government should have any part in this. It's a personal and household level issue. In my neighborhood, there are a couple of openly gay couples, not married because they're not allowed to. But they function just like any other family. They walk their dogs on the street like anyone else does. I think it's ridiculous that Bush is trying to interpret marriage in his own way.\n\nYes, I mean, I've read and heard numerous reports and heard from different sources that it's something that might be predisposed to in your brain, as opposed to growing up with certain family dynamics. So that would be the biological side opposed to sociological.\n\nWell, besides the obvious, I think it's because marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can just run off to Las Vegas and do it. But if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal, private thing rather than a public or national domain.",

Once something is out there, it can influence people's opinions of you, especially if it's something like talking about physical violence. Online, anything you say might be taken seriously by others. Even if you're just joking. Schools have strict protocols when someone posts something concerning. They can't ignore it, just in case something serious happens. However, not everything should be taken seriously. Some people do post things as jokes. But if something is brought to the school's attention, they have to take it seriously. The school should not monitor students' social media accounts, but if a student posts something dangerous, the school has to act. It's not an invasion of privacy if someone else brings it to their attention. Teachers should not create fake accounts to friend students.

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged far too much. Initially, I thought the purpose was good—to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we've lost sight of this goal. Now, it seems we're fighting for the sake of it, to prove our power. The original motivation might have been questionable due to George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, it was justifiable. However, I think we’ve now lost our original cause. We should have achieved our purpose within the first couple of months, but the war has dragged on for over a year. I think it’s been prolonged enough. Our reason for continuing the war has deteriorated and been misconceived; it seems like we’re still fighting just to fight. We don’t want to end the war without a decisive victory. The war has gone on long enough. I believe Iraq's government should now take care of itself. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions on this war while we have our own issues at home, like poverty and education. War is not sustainable for the long term. Instead of spending money on a foreign war, we should focus on our own internal improvements, such as public roads, schools, and healthcare.",

And, um, the general consensus everywhere is that it was a bad idea, except within the administration because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, I mean, you just have to look at the recent polls. They've done U.S. polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the U.S. troops there think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. Um, I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between, like, the United States and the Middle Eastern states.

Um, I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that.

            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it's been downgraded from a criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know, something you might get cited for rather than booked and arrested. I believe that if someone gets caught and cited for it, the consequences could still affect job interviews and other aspects of life, just like a drug charge. The worst ramifications of a drug charge usually involve being jailed, and the costs of prosecuting and incarcerating people are substantial. When municipalities are facing financial difficulties, many are reluctant to make these changes, even if it could free up funds for other programs. In Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, this change is seen more favorably. The municipality has more money to spend on education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. I think it's important to consider these factors, as marijuana shouldn't be widespread on the streets. It's not something that should be legalized to the extent that it's sold in gas stations and smoked openly. It's still taboo in many places and contexts. I'm not sure how I feel about legalization because it could lead to people smoking it while driving. Marijuana and alcohol both have adverse effects on people, and the impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people can handle substances well, while others cannot.

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in several ways. Many people believe that the Church is losing its followers because it's not very accepting of certain issues. For instance, they're against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While their strong views are fine, they sometimes seem outdated. If they adopted a more modern perspective, they might not worry about losing followers. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Church due to their views, as people don't agree with them on certain subjects. I feel that the Church has the wrong views on some things. For example, the Church is against abortion, so if someone is pro-choice, they might not feel comfortable in a community that teaches abortion is completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with you. I don't see a reason why women can't be priests or priests can't be married. I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a job and a family life, as everyone else does. The Church says priests are married to God, but they're still devoted to their work and family.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that people are not responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not something they choose, so it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like it's a choice they make. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just a part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nBecause\nFrankly, there's no good reason not to\nMany people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families\nBut\nIt's so different\nIt has many different aspects, it can't be considered the same\nIt's like two sides of the same coin\nOne side is heads, the other side is tails\nYet\nIt's essentially the same thing\nAnd\nThere are many civil rights that come with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and healthcare, where\nIf you're in a same-sex couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you\nBecause they're not technically family\n\nAnd\nI think that's ridiculous, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nMany scientific studies have shown that\nSame-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing\nAnd\nI think where many people get stuck is\nSame-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey're asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\n\nAnd\nIf there's no involvement of church and state, that shouldn't be an issue\nBecause\nI can't understand why people, like Catholics, get hung up on \"that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us\" when\nIn a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal\nThey are\nThey're the same in many ways, like the types of relationships and roles played by different partners\nAnd\nPeople worry about adoption issues and how a same-sex couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about children of same-sex couples and how they'll adjust to society\nWhether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices\n\nBut\nWell, again, it's new, so it's hard to say\nI'm not sure about the children aspect\nBecause\nI think the main drawback is\nHow children are treated by their peers and by other adults in society\n\nLike in New York City, there are special schools for children of same-sex parents\nBecause in public schools in New York City, they get bullied\nAnd\nParents protest to get the child removed from the school\nAnd\nIt's just a kid\nThey're going to have the same points of view and everything\nParenting skills are the same in same-sex couples as in heterosexual couples\n\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to\nIt's just about personal choices\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking same-sex marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\n\nBut\nI think President Bush has very strong views on this, having to do with his religion\nHis stance on same-sex marriage actually aligns with his stance on abortion and stem cell research\nI'm not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly, I try not to pay attention to politics much\nBut\nThe main reasons I've heard are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo go along with what religious groups believe and create an amendment banning same-sex marriage is hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering there's been opposition to \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance\nBut\nYet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\n\nAnd\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThat the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood or a personality defect\nBut\nThat's not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue\nAnd\nIf people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and friends or popular opinion in their culture or church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little differently",

So, I mean, as far as having it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes, because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, just like if you abuse alcohol too. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say you could integrate it gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Uh, yeah, um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that.

            "I think the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, and it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, dressed in cute little outfits with matching shoes and a purse. Now, as I've grown older, they've created a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, even in summer, some come in beach clothes. The church has become more casual even in morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis. As for other aspects, the biggest change I've noticed is that the church is less formal. I don't know the politics within the church, but that's what I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is often genetic and can't be hidden through marriage. If the church had known and tried to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think they always knew. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but I believe everyone was still very much recovering from the September 11 attacks. We may have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, as there were indeed pretexts that led us into the war. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11 attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know to be false. This really gets under my skin, and the Iraq war just boils my blood. I think the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I think that's malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11. I think they came into office with the intention to go to war. There's a former Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after being forced out of his office. I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration and was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which was a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I worry that if we withdraw now, the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. I think the alternative being considered, with a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to restore order, won't necessarily solve the problem. I don't think that's a good idea in the long term because it will cause more issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, as the interim government seems to be falling apart. From the news reports, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is effective at all, and the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process. Even Muqtada al-Sadr's party now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government. The political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.",

            "I don't feel it's right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. It's up to the churches to decide, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of control over it would go against what's already established. The people trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think the government should decide this, as it's not their place. The separation of church and state has been a fundamental part of our constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already stated. It would likely restrict people rather than the government, which isn't right. The federal government or any government shouldn't be involved, as it's against personal beliefs. The push for this amendment is just a preference for one religion over others. Ultimately, it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There's no logical reason to create an amendment banning it, as it won't impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact.",
            "Well\nThe war in Iraq\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq, and the government tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when, in reality, they didn’t have that much to do with each other. However, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the attacks of September 11, 2001. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes. Many American soldiers have died, and the government wasn’t prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. The United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the challenges and the time required to implement such a system.\n\nThe government should have been better prepared. They didn’t plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, and many American troops are still dying. The government should have known that it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory. There are many insurgents in Iraq, and it’s hard to fight them when they are civilians. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision.

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it, reducing it from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction such as a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited for it, the impact on job interviews and other areas might not be as severe as having a drug charge. While the future ramifications might not disappear with decriminalization, there is an argument that it's more cost-effective to cite people rather than arrest, book, and house them, and then have them go through the court process. Communities that are financially struggling might be hesitant to make such a change, even if it would free up significant resources. In places like Denver, which tend to be more liberal, they might find it acceptable. The municipality there could then use the saved money to fund public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be everywhere, there are other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be fully legalized, such as the potential for it to be sold in gas stations and smoked openly, which could be seen as awkward in many contexts. Additionally, while alcohol can have more debilitating effects on motor skills, marijuana can have more adverse effects on lifestyle. Every person reacts differently to substances, and some people may have personalities that lead them to use substances more or less moderately. Overall, both substances have their own adverse effects.",

            "This matter is still up in the air for me, so I can't say for certain what's right or wrong. However, I find this the most challenging topic we’re facing today. The issue is so close to the line between church and state, and defining marriage without offending anyone is tricky. I'm not sure whether civil unions should be treated the same as marriage by the government. After all, people don't get tax breaks or special treatment simply because they're baptized. So, if two people are married, I think they should be seen as in a civil union. It's two people united, and the government shouldn't delve into what kind of marriage it was. As for gay marriage, it's just two people getting a civil union. If all states can reach a reasonable conclusion, they should push for it to become federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous; it's not important enough to amend the constitution. It's just not significant enough to define or ban gay marriage. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so I'm a bit conflicted about homosexuality because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision for each state to make on its own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Most states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear that democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratically leaning and they choose to legalize gay marriage, it's their right. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that, but I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide for the entire country. I believe that each state should decide for itself, and I don't agree with his ban on it. It's not fair for Bush to decide how each state wants to run itself. He's not the one who will have to live with the consequences. I think some things should be left up to each individual state. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will be the ones living with the decision.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in several ways. Many people believe that the Church is losing its followers because it's not very accepting of certain issues. For instance, they're against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While their strong views are fine, they sometimes seem outdated. If they adopted a more modern perspective, they might not worry about losing followers. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Church due to their views, as people don't agree with them on certain subjects. I feel that the Church has the wrong views on some things. For example, the Church is against abortion, so if someone is pro-choice, they might not feel comfortable in a community that teaches abortion is completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with you. I don't see a reason why women can't be priests or priests can't be married. I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a job and a family life, as everyone else does. The Church says priests are married to God, but they're still devoted to their work and family.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that people are not responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not something they choose, so it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like it's a choice they make. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just a part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nBecause\nFrankly, there's no good reason not to\nMany people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families\nBut\nIt's so different\nIt has many different aspects, it can't be considered the same\nIt's like two sides of the same coin\nOne side is heads, the other side is tails\nYet\nIt's essentially the same thing\nAnd\nThere are many civil rights that come with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and healthcare, where\nIf you're in a same-sex couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you\nBecause they're not technically family\n\nAnd\nI think that's ridiculous, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nMany scientific studies have shown that\nSame-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing\nAnd\nI think where many people get stuck is\nSame-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey're asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\n\nAnd\nIf there's no involvement of church and state, that shouldn't be an issue\nBecause\nI can't understand why people, like Catholics, get hung up on \"that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us\" when\nIn a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal\nThey are\nThey're the same in many ways, like the types of relationships and roles played by different partners\nAnd\nPeople worry about adoption issues and how a same-sex couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about children of same-sex couples and how they'll adjust to society\nWhether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices\n\nBut\nWell, again, it's new, so it's hard to say\nI'm not sure about the children aspect\nBecause\nI think the main drawback is\nHow children are treated by their peers and by other adults in society\n\nLike in New York City, there are special schools for children of same-sex parents\nBecause in public schools in New York City, they get bullied\nAnd\nParents protest to get the child removed from the school\nAnd\nIt's just a kid\nThey're going to have the same points of view and everything\nParenting skills are the same in same-sex couples as in heterosexual couples\n\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to\nIt's just about personal choices\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking same-sex marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\n\nBut\nI think President Bush has very strong views on this, having to do with his religion\nHis stance on same-sex marriage actually aligns with his stance on abortion and stem cell research\nI'm not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly, I try not to pay attention to politics much\nBut\nThe main reasons I've heard are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo go along with what religious groups believe and create an amendment banning same-sex marriage is hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering there's been opposition to \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance\nBut\nYet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\n\nAnd\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThat the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood or a personality defect\nBut\nThat's not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue\nAnd\nIf people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and friends or popular opinion in their culture or church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little differently",

So, I mean, as far as having it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes, because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, just like if you abuse alcohol too. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say you could integrate it gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Uh, yeah, um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Um, so, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, and it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, dressed in cute little outfits with matching shoes and a purse. Now, as I've grown older, they've created a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, even in summer, some come in beach clothes. The church has become more casual even in morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis. As for other aspects, the biggest change I've noticed is that the church is less formal. I don't know the politics within the church, but that's what I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is often genetic and can't be hidden through marriage. If the church had known and tried to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think they always knew. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but I believe everyone was still very much recovering from the September 11 attacks. We may have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, as there were indeed pretexts that led us into the war. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11 attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know to be false. This really gets under my skin, and the Iraq war just boils my blood. I think the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I think that's malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11. I think they came into office with the intention to go to war. There's a former Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after being forced out of his office. I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration and was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which was a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I worry that if we withdraw now, the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. I think the alternative being considered, with a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to restore order, won't necessarily solve the problem. I don't think that's a good idea in the long term because it will cause more issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, as the interim government seems to be falling apart. From the news reports, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is effective at all, and the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process. Even Muqtada al-Sadr's party now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government. The political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.",

            "I don't feel it's right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. It's up to the churches to decide, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of control over it would go against what's already established. The people trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think the government should decide this, as it's not their place. The separation of church and state has been a fundamental part of our constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already stated. It would likely restrict people rather than the government, which isn't right. The federal government or any government shouldn't be involved, as it's against personal beliefs. The push for this amendment is just a preference for one religion over others. Ultimately, it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There's no logical reason to create an amendment banning it, as it won't impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact.",
            "Well\nThe war in Iraq\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq, and the government tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when, in reality, they didn’t have that much to do with each other. However, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the attacks of September 11, 2001. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes. Many American soldiers have died, and the government wasn’t prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. The United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the challenges and the time required to implement such a system.\n\nThe government should have been better prepared. They didn’t plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, and many American troops are still dying. The government should have known that it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory. There are many insurgents in Iraq, and it’s hard to fight them when they are civilians. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision. It’s hard to abandon the people we took the government from, but how much is too much risk to keep taking for a free democratic Iraq?\n\nLet’s see\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there.

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it, reducing it from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction such as a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited for it, the impact on job interviews and other areas might not be as severe as having a drug charge. While the future ramifications might not disappear with decriminalization, there is an argument that it's more cost-effective to cite people rather than arrest, book, and house them, and then have them go through the court process. Communities that are financially struggling might be hesitant to make such a change, even if it would free up significant resources. In places like Denver, which tend to be more liberal, they might find it acceptable. The municipality there could then use the saved money to fund public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be everywhere, there are other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be fully legalized, such as the potential for it to be sold in gas stations and smoked openly, which could be seen as awkward in many contexts. Additionally, while alcohol can have more debilitating effects on motor skills, marijuana can have more adverse effects on lifestyle. Every person reacts differently to substances, and some people may have personalities that lead them to use substances more or less moderately. Overall, both substances have their own adverse effects.",

            "This matter is still up in the air for me, so I can't say for certain what's right or wrong. However, I find this the most challenging topic we’re facing today. The issue is so close to the line between church and state, and defining marriage without offending anyone is tricky. I'm not sure whether civil unions should be treated the same as marriage by the government. After all, people don't get tax breaks or special treatment simply because they're baptized. So, if two people are married, I think they should be seen as in a civil union. It's two people united, and the government shouldn't delve into what kind of marriage it was. As for gay marriage, it's just two people getting a civil union. If all states can reach a reasonable conclusion, they should push for it to become federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous; it's not important enough to amend the constitution. It's just not significant enough to define or ban gay marriage. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so I'm a bit conflicted about homosexuality because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision for each state to make on its own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Most states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear that democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratically leaning and they choose to legalize gay marriage, it's their right. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that, but I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide for the entire country. I believe that each state should decide for itself, and I don't agree with his ban on it. It's not fair for Bush to decide how each state wants to run itself. He's not the one who will have to live with the consequences. I think some things should be left up to each individual state. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will be the ones living with the decision.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in several ways. Many people believe that the Church is losing its followers because it's not very accepting of certain issues. For instance, they're against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While their strong views are fine, they sometimes seem outdated. If they adopted a more modern perspective, they might not worry about losing followers. I've heard that some people are turning away from the Church due to their views, as people don't agree with them on certain subjects. I feel that the Church has the wrong views on some things. For example, the Church is against abortion, so if someone is pro-choice, they might not feel comfortable in a community that teaches abortion is completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to follow a Church that doesn't agree with you. I don't see a reason why women can't be priests or priests can't be married. I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a job and a family life, as everyone else does. The Church says priests are married to God, but they're still devoted to their work and family.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that people are not responsible for their sexual orientation. It's not something they choose, so it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but not two people of the same sex. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say it's wrong to say that. It's not like it's a choice they make. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It's just a part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it. That's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nBecause\nFrankly, there's no good reason not to\nMany people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families\nBut\nIt's so different\nIt has many different aspects, it can't be considered the same\nIt's like two sides of the same coin\nOne side is heads, the other side is tails\nYet\nIt's essentially the same thing\nAnd\nThere are many civil rights that come with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and healthcare, where\nIf you're in a same-sex couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you\nBecause they're not technically family\n\nAnd\nI think that's ridiculous, if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nMany scientific studies have shown that\nSame-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing\nAnd\nI think where many people get stuck is\nSame-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey're asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\n\nAnd\nIf there's no involvement of church and state, that shouldn't be an issue\nBecause\nI can't understand why people, like Catholics, get hung up on \"that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us\" when\nIn a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal\nThey are\nThey're the same in many ways, like the types of relationships and roles played by different partners\nAnd\nPeople worry about adoption issues and how a same-sex couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about children of same-sex couples and how they'll adjust to society\nWhether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation choices\n\nBut\nWell, again, it's new, so it's hard to say\nI'm not sure about the children aspect\nBecause\nI think the main drawback is\nHow children are treated by their peers and by other adults in society\n\nLike in New York City, there are special schools for children of same-sex parents\nBecause in public schools in New York City, they get bullied\nAnd\nParents protest to get the child removed from the school\nAnd\nIt's just a kid\nThey're going to have the same points of view and everything\nParenting skills are the same in same-sex couples as in heterosexual couples\n\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to\nIt's just about personal choices\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking same-sex marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\n\nBut\nI think President Bush has very strong views on this, having to do with his religion\nHis stance on same-sex marriage actually aligns with his stance on abortion and stem cell research\nI'm not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly, I try not to pay attention to politics much\nBut\nThe main reasons I've heard are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality, I don't want to say it's negotiable, but\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo go along with what religious groups believe and create an amendment banning same-sex marriage is hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering there's been opposition to \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance\nBut\nYet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\n\nAnd\nMany people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThat the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood or a personality defect\nBut\nThat's not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue\nAnd\nIf people listened to institutions that actually do research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and friends or popular opinion in their culture or church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little differently",

So, I mean, as far as having it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes, because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, just like if you abuse alcohol too. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say you could integrate it gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Uh, yeah, um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean, it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that.

            "I think the church has adapted to the twenty-first century, and it's not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I used to go to church every Sunday, dressed in cute little outfits with matching shoes and a purse. Now, as I've grown older, they've created a teenager mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, even in summer, some come in beach clothes. The church has become more casual even in morning masses, where people wear jeans and khakis. As for other aspects, the biggest change I've noticed is that the church is less formal. I don't know the politics within the church, but that's what I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is often genetic and can't be hidden through marriage. If the church had known and tried to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think they always knew. I don't have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but I believe everyone was still very much recovering from the September 11 attacks. We may have gone into Iraq under false pretenses, as there were indeed pretexts that led us into the war. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11 attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which we now know to be false. This really gets under my skin, and the Iraq war just boils my blood. I think the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it yet. Even Colin Powell, who gave that big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I think that's malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11. I think they came into office with the intention to go to war. There's a former Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after being forced out of his office. I believe the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration and was also hoping to expand our energy supply, which was a very underhanded way to do things. I think it's gone on long enough, but I worry that if we withdraw now, the country could descend into civil war and more people would die. I think the alternative being considered, with a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia coming in to restore order, won't necessarily solve the problem. I don't think that's a good idea in the long term because it will cause more issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, as the interim government seems to be falling apart. From the news reports, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is effective at all, and the Prime Minister doesn't have control over the political process. Even Muqtada al-Sadr's party now holds 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and there are still radical elements vying for control of the government. The political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.",

            "I don't feel it's right to make it legal or for a state to declare it as such. It's up to the churches to decide, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of control over it would go against what's already established. The people trying to make it illegal are basically choosing one church's beliefs over another, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think the government should decide this, as it's not their place. The separation of church and state has been a fundamental part of our constitution, allowing for religious tolerance. Making an amendment about it would be wrong and contradictory to what's already stated. It would likely restrict people rather than the government, which isn't right. The federal government or any government shouldn't be involved, as it's against personal beliefs. The push for this amendment is just a preference for one religion over others. Ultimately, it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or any government official. There's no logical reason to create an amendment banning it, as it won't impact the economy or society negatively. In fact, it might have a positive impact.",
            "Well\nThe war in Iraq\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq, and the government tried to connect the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when, in reality, they didn’t have that much to do with each other. However, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people, who were outraged by the attacks of September 11, 2001. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\n\nI myself am against war, especially making a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes. Many American soldiers have died, and the government wasn’t prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would occur after removing the Iraqi government. The United States is trying to implant a democratic government, similar to what was attempted in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the challenges and the time required to implement such a system.\n\nThe government should have been better prepared. They didn’t plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, and many American troops are still dying. The government should have known that it would be a long and hard ordeal, not a clear victory. There are many insurgents in Iraq, and it’s hard to fight them when they are civilians. The war in Iraq is a difficult decision.

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it, reducing it from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction such as a traffic ticket. If someone gets caught and cited for it, the impact on job interviews and other areas might not be as severe as having a drug charge. While the future ramifications might not disappear with decriminalization, there is an argument that it's more cost-effective to cite people rather than arrest, book, and house them, and then have them go through the court process. Communities that are financially struggling might be hesitant to make such a change, even if it would free up significant resources. In places like Denver, which tend to be more liberal, they might find it acceptable. The municipality there could then use the saved money to fund public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be everywhere, there are other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be fully legalized, such as the potential for it to be sold in gas stations and smoked openly, which could be seen as awkward in many contexts. Additionally, while alcohol can have more debilitating effects on motor skills, marijuana can have more adverse effects on lifestyle. Every person reacts differently to substances, and some people may have personalities that lead them to use substances more or less moderately. Overall, both substances have their own adverse effects.",

            "This matter is still up in the air for me, so I can't say for certain what's right or wrong. However, I find this the most challenging topic we’re facing today. The issue is so close to the line between church and state, and defining marriage without offending anyone is tricky. I'm not sure whether civil unions should be treated the same as marriage by the government. After all, people don't get tax breaks or special treatment simply because they're baptized. So, if two people are married, I think they should be seen as in a civil union. It's two people united, and the government shouldn't delve into what kind of marriage it was. As for gay marriage, it's just two people getting a civil union. If all states can reach a reasonable conclusion, they should push for it to become federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous; it's not important enough to amend the constitution. It's just not significant enough to define or ban gay marriage. Simply put, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so I'm a bit conflicted about homosexuality because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision for each state to make on its own, rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Most states are either democratic or republican, and it's clear that democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a state that's democratically leaning and they choose to legalize gay marriage, it's their right. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that, but I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide for the entire country. I believe that each state should decide for itself, and I don't agree with his ban on it. It's not fair for Bush to decide how each state wants to run itself. He's not the one who will have to live with the consequences. I think some things should be left up to each individual state. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will be the ones living with the decision.",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "There is no concrete reason to oppose the legalization of gay marriage. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this is a misconception. Gay and straight relationships are fundamentally different, just as the heads and tails of a coin are different, yet they are still two sides of the same coin. Legalizing gay marriage would provide gay couples with the same civil rights as heterosexual couples, including property rights and healthcare access. For instance, a gay couple's partner may not be allowed in a hospital room if one of them is sick because they are not considered family. Additionally, many scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The focus of opposition to gay marriage is often on religious grounds, but in a secular context, it should not be an issue. Allowing civil unions should logically extend to legal marriage. Segregation in the past has proven to be unjust, and the same principle applies to gay couples. The issue of gay couples adopting children and their impact on society is a concern, but studies have shown that children of gay parents have the same parenting skills and can be as successful as children of straight parents. Federal involvement in making gay marriage legal in every state is necessary. The amendment should be the opposite of what it proposes. However, President Bush's views on gay marriage are influenced by his religious beliefs and are similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His beliefs are not universally shared, and it is unethical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the United States. Many people oppose gay marriage due to the misconception that gay individuals are psychologically damaged, but the American Psychological Association has discredited this notion. If people listened to scientific institutions instead of popular opinion, the world would be seen differently.",

Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it is beneficial. It’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances.

You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\nUm, I don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things too. Um, it’s a tough one. I’d say, not that you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once.

            "I really don't feel that it's right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it should be up to the churches to decide, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's clearly stated in the constitution, and I feel that any attempt to enforce laws over this would go against what's already been said and written in stone. In terms of those trying to make it illegal, I believe they're choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in some areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about this would be right, as it would contradict what's already been said and written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. So, I don't feel it's right in that aspect.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for his religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason backing the amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or society in a negative way. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society. I think I've said it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nFrom the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and exploited the American people’s outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, leading to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nUm\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War in many ways, and the government should have learned from its past mistakes.\nI mean, a tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and the government didn’t seem prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. The United States removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what happened in Vietnam. They were trying to push out communists and uphold democracy, but it was a long and difficult process.\nI think the government underestimated the challenges and should have planned more thoroughly for the potential outcomes. They didn’t seem prepared for the void of power and the chaos that would follow. The US is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It’s a long process, and I just think the government tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\nAs for the election in 2004, one of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. It’s hard to abandon people whose government and way of life we’ve taken away. But there are also considerations about the high number of American casualties and whether it’s worth the risk for a free democratic Iraq.\nGoing back to the original reasons for invading Iraq, why just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this in other countries? I think it’s often about resources, like oil. Before the invasion, there were claims about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, we know other countries, like North Korea, have them, but we’re not making any attacks. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there’s peace, but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much. I think the purpose was good in the beginning, to restore democracy in another country. But I think we’ve lost sight of that purpose, and now we’re maybe just doing it to prove that we’re some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motives were questionable, especially given George Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn’t have a fair political system, that would be a fair reason. But if there were any personal matters involved, I don’t think it would be fair. I do think it’s been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple months, just starting the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it’s gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it’s way too drawn out. I think, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that’s a just purpose. That’s a good reason for the war. But I don’t think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived, just like it seems that we’re still at war just for the purpose of going to war, and we don’t want to come out of it without a decisive end or victory or whatever. I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when the government and officials of the other country will have to take care of themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We’ve long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on our own wars, like poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now, that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for.

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just about women; it's also about the specific field of work that you're in. For example, I feel that women have a harder time because of the glass ceiling, where even when they're qualified, they're less likely to be promoted to higher positions because society has traditionally seen men in higher positions. The same goes for men in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's still uncommon for men to be stay-at-home parents, and society often looks down on it, assuming that men should be the primary breadwinners. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men, especially straight men, can be taken less seriously. In some ways, it's because people don't think they understand fashion as well as women do. Ultimately, I feel that there is gender discrimination in society in the U.S., and changing it is slow because society has deeply ingrained beliefs. However, things are starting to change, as women are becoming more accepted in higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. To promote change, we should focus on highlighting the positive qualities of those who are stereotyped against, rather than being too pushy. We're at a good balance where these changes are being enforced, so it's important not to rush the process. Additionally, there can be discrimination based on the type of job or where someone is from, as well as from gender to gender. I'm not entirely sure what to say about this.",

Many states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and may not. Living in a state means you generally know its stance on the issue, and if a state chooses to legalize it, I wouldn't disagree because you chose to live there. Homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "There is no concrete reason to oppose the legalization of gay marriage. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this is a misconception. Gay and straight relationships are fundamentally different, just as the heads and tails of a coin are different, yet they are still two sides of the same coin. Legalizing gay marriage would provide gay couples with the same civil rights as heterosexual couples, including property rights and healthcare access. For instance, a gay couple's partner may not be allowed in a hospital room if one of them is sick because they are not considered family. Additionally, many scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The focus of opposition to gay marriage is often on religious grounds, but in a secular context, it should not be an issue. Allowing civil unions should logically extend to legal marriage. Segregation in the past has proven to be unjust, and the same principle applies to gay couples. The issue of gay couples adopting children and their impact on society is a concern, but studies have shown that children of gay parents have the same parenting skills and can be as successful as children of straight parents. Federal involvement in making gay marriage legal in every state is necessary. The amendment should be the opposite of what it proposes. However, President Bush's views on gay marriage are influenced by his religious beliefs and are similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His beliefs are not universally shared, and it is unethical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the United States. Many people oppose gay marriage due to the misconception that gay individuals are psychologically damaged, but the American Psychological Association has discredited this notion. If people listened to scientific institutions instead of popular opinion, the world would be seen differently.",

Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it is beneficial. It’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances.

You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\nUm, I don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things too. Um, it’s a tough one. I’d say, not that you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once.

            "I really don't feel that it's right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it should be up to the churches to decide, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's clearly stated in the constitution, and I feel that any attempt to enforce laws over this would go against what's already been said and written in stone. In terms of those trying to make it illegal, I believe they're choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in some areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about this would be right, as it would contradict what's already been said and written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. So, I don't feel it's right in that aspect.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for his religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason backing the amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or society in a negative way. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society. I think I've said it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nFrom the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and exploited the American people’s outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, leading to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nUm\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War in many ways, and the government should have learned from its past mistakes.\nI mean, a tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and the government didn’t seem prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. The United States removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what happened in Vietnam. They were trying to push out communists and uphold democracy, but it was a long and difficult process.\nI think the government underestimated the challenges and should have planned more thoroughly for the potential outcomes. They didn’t seem prepared for the void of power and the chaos that would follow. The US is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It’s a long process, and I just think the government tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\nAs for the election in 2004, one of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. It’s hard to abandon people whose government and way of life we’ve taken away. But there are also considerations about the high number of American casualties and whether it’s worth the risk for a free democratic Iraq.\nGoing back to the original reasons for invading Iraq, why just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this in other countries? I think it’s often about resources, like oil. Before the invasion, there were claims about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, we know other countries, like North Korea, have them, but we’re not making any attacks. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there’s peace, but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much. I think the purpose was good in the beginning, to restore democracy in another country. But I think we’ve lost sight of that purpose, and now we’re maybe just doing it to prove that we’re some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motives were questionable, especially given George Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn’t have a fair political system, that would be a fair reason. But if there were any personal matters involved, I don’t think it would be fair. I do think it’s been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple months, just starting the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it’s gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it’s way too drawn out. I think, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that’s a just purpose. That’s a good reason for the war. But I don’t think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived, just like it seems that we’re still at war just for the purpose of going to war, and we don’t want to come out of it without a decisive end or victory or whatever. I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when the government and officials of the other country will have to take care of themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We’ve long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on our own wars, like poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now, that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for.

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just about women; it's also about the specific field of work that you're in. For example, I feel that women have a harder time because of the glass ceiling, where even when they're qualified, they're less likely to be promoted to higher positions because society has traditionally seen men in higher positions. The same goes for men in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's still uncommon for men to be stay-at-home parents, and society often looks down on it, assuming that men should be the primary breadwinners. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men, especially straight men, can be taken less seriously. In some ways, it's because people don't think they understand fashion as well as women do. Ultimately, I feel that there is gender discrimination in society in the U.S., and changing it is slow because society has deeply ingrained beliefs. However, things are starting to change, as women are becoming more accepted in higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. To promote change, we should focus on highlighting the positive qualities of those who are stereotyped against, rather than being too pushy. We're at a good balance where these changes are being enforced, so it's important not to rush the process. Additionally, there can be discrimination based on the type of job or where someone is from, as well as from gender to gender. I'm not entirely sure what to say about this.",

Many states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and may not. Living in a state means you generally know its stance on the issue, and if a state chooses to legalize it, I wouldn't disagree because you chose to live there. Homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "There is no concrete reason to oppose the legalization of gay marriage. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this is a misconception. Gay and straight relationships are fundamentally different, just as the heads and tails of a coin are different, yet they are still two sides of the same coin. Legalizing gay marriage would provide gay couples with the same civil rights as heterosexual couples, including property rights and healthcare access. For instance, a gay couple's partner may not be allowed in a hospital room if one of them is sick because they are not considered family. Additionally, many scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same rates of relationship success and satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The focus of opposition to gay marriage is often on religious grounds, but in a secular context, it should not be an issue. Allowing civil unions should logically extend to legal marriage. Segregation in the past has proven to be unjust, and the same principle applies to gay couples. The issue of gay couples adopting children and their impact on society is a concern, but studies have shown that children of gay parents have the same parenting skills and can be as successful as children of straight parents. Federal involvement in making gay marriage legal in every state is necessary. The amendment should be the opposite of what it proposes. However, President Bush's views on gay marriage are influenced by his religious beliefs and are similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. His beliefs are not universally shared, and it is unethical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while ignoring the cultural and moral diversity of the United States. Many people oppose gay marriage due to the misconception that gay individuals are psychologically damaged, but the American Psychological Association has discredited this notion. If people listened to scientific institutions instead of popular opinion, the world would be seen differently.",

Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it is beneficial. It’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances.

You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\nUm, I don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if you abuse it, it can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things too. Um, it’s a tough one. I’d say, not that you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once.

            "I really don't feel that it's right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it should be up to the churches to decide, as the constitution explicitly states the separation of church and state. It's clearly stated in the constitution, and I feel that any attempt to enforce laws over this would go against what's already been said and written in stone. In terms of those trying to make it illegal, I believe they're choosing one church's beliefs over another. Most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in some areas like Boston. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and can't make illegal. Separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. I don't think making an amendment about this would be right, as it would contradict what's already been said and written. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. So, I don't feel it's right in that aspect.\n\nNo, I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't see why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for his religion over others. I really feel it's up to the churches to decide, not the president or anyone in government. There isn't a good reason backing the amendment other than personal views. I don't see how it would impact the economy or society in a negative way. In fact, it might have a positive impact on society. I think I've said it all.",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nFrom the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely truthful with the American people about the reasons for going to war. Before invading Iraq, I believe there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and exploited the American people’s outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, leading to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.\nUm\nI myself am generally against war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War in many ways, and the government should have learned from its past mistakes.\nI mean, a tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and the government didn’t seem prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. The United States removed the Iraqi government and tried to establish a democratic one, similar to what happened in Vietnam. They were trying to push out communists and uphold democracy, but it was a long and difficult process.\nI think the government underestimated the challenges and should have planned more thoroughly for the potential outcomes. They didn’t seem prepared for the void of power and the chaos that would follow. The US is still there today, trying to train Iraqi troops and police forces to police their own country. It’s a long process, and I just think the government tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq.\nAs for the election in 2004, one of my reasons for considering voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. It’s hard to abandon people whose government and way of life we’ve taken away. But there are also considerations about the high number of American casualties and whether it’s worth the risk for a free democratic Iraq.\nGoing back to the original reasons for invading Iraq, why just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this in other countries? I think it’s often about resources, like oil. Before the invasion, there were claims about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. Meanwhile, we know other countries, like North Korea, have them, but we’re not making any attacks. I don’t think the US government is being thorough or truthful enough in its decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there’s peace, but probably not.",

            "I feel like the war has been drawn out far too much. I think the purpose was good in the beginning, to restore democracy in another country. But I think we’ve lost sight of that purpose, and now we’re maybe just doing it to prove that we’re some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motives were questionable, especially given George Bush’s father’s previous quarrels with Saddam Hussein. If the original motivation was to give democracy to a country that didn’t have a fair political system, that would be a fair reason. But if there were any personal matters involved, I don’t think it would be fair. I do think it’s been drawn out. I think we got our purpose across in the first couple months, just starting the war. That was a statement in itself. But the fact that it’s gone on for over a year, several years, I just think it’s way too drawn out. I think, if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that’s a just purpose. That’s a good reason for the war. But I don’t think our reason over time has been deteriorated and misconceived, just like it seems that we’re still at war just for the purpose of going to war, and we don’t want to come out of it without a decisive end or victory or whatever. I do think it has gone on long enough, and it should stop. I mean, there comes a point when the government and officials of the other country will have to take care of themselves anyway. And I think that time has come. We’ve long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on our own wars, like poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it’s a drain on our economy for a purpose that’s long since been drawn out. Yeah, I mean they’re spending billions and billions of dollars, and war is not something that should be in our budget for the long term. There are things obviously like poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads or anything dealing with schools. We certainly have a lot of problems funding things like that. Healthcare, I think that money could be much better spent on. Right now, that money’s being spent to have some of our own citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we’ve lost the cause for.

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. And it's not just about women; it's also about the specific field of work that you're in. For example, I feel that women have a harder time because of the glass ceiling, where even when they're qualified, they're less likely to be promoted to higher positions because society has traditionally seen men in higher positions. The same goes for men in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's still uncommon for men to be stay-at-home parents, and society often looks down on it, assuming that men should be the primary breadwinners. Additionally, in the fashion industry, men, especially straight men, can be taken less seriously. In some ways, it's because people don't think they understand fashion as well as women do. Ultimately, I feel that there is gender discrimination in society in the U.S., and changing it is slow because society has deeply ingrained beliefs. However, things are starting to change, as women are becoming more accepted in higher positions and stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted. To promote change, we should focus on highlighting the positive qualities of those who are stereotyped against, rather than being too pushy. We're at a good balance where these changes are being enforced, so it's important not to rush the process. Additionally, there can be discrimination based on the type of job or where someone is from, as well as from gender to gender. I'm not entirely sure what to say about this.",

Many states are democratic and will push for gay marriage, while others are republican and may not. Living in a state means you generally know its stance on the issue, and if a state chooses to legalize it, I wouldn't disagree because you chose to live there. Homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.
