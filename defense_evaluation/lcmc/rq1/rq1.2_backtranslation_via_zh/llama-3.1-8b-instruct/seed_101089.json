            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few ways. They have many people talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things.\n\nIn the case of gay marriage, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine. But their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard there are a lot of people starting to have a little bit of a negative view of the Catholic Church because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nYeah, I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong, and that you were going against it. And the same goes with gay marriage and things like that - if that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know if they would have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, I don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God, and they're devoted to their complete life. But I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they're devoted to. So I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nNo.",
            "Personally, I don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think, no matter if you're born that way or not, sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. Like, I was born straight, and another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be responsible for, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this. It's not really a legal issue, and I don't think it's a moral issue either. I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal and judged for their sexual orientation. So I don't think the federal government really has a say in this. \n\nIt's complicated. (laughs) I don't think the federal government should get involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it's not a moral concern, it's not like anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people. That's just how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and they shouldn't be punished for that. No, that's it.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. If it's available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. \n\nYou know, there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percoet. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of these just because there's a taboo around marijuana doesn't make sense to me. We should accept its benefits.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, it can still have negative effects, just like alcohol. But it's a tough one. I say, let's integrate it, let it become legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, not like heroin or cocaine. If we get rid of the image of marijuana as a horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. I think the church is not as strict as it used to be. I know that even though I've grown up, when I was a kid, I always went to church every Sunday. I would wear cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just a part of going to church. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends at church on the weekends. We would just go to church. But as I've gotten older, they've set up a teenager mass, and they've shortened the mass to 30 minutes. People dress more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families running late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at morning mass, I used to always dress up. People are now wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing that I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church. But yeah, that's it. [Okay, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could've been avoided. Because there are married men who still become pedophiles. They still have an attraction to young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. I think there are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [man] he is, but he's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [Okay, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, I was going to say... about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think... like, the whole thing about sexuality being related to genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people can just become pedophiles. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with how they're raised. It might have something to do in some cases, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through marriage. You can try, but it usually comes out. So I don't think the church could've done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, that's shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. [Okay, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "(laughs)\nUm, I initially was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false. And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. Um, I think that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact, even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it. And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I was wondering if I should just talk about it? Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq. I don't keep up with it, I don't know the details, but at this point, I know we're just staying there to try and build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and also to get oil and stuff from them. But that's no reason for staying there because it's making everyone upset. So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say, I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States, that it's going to be even worse for them, and it's going to be like, I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them, and they've been going on this whole like a totalitarian, like a whole dictatorship thing for so long, that you know, I feel like it's going to, that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there, so I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years, hmm, that's about it, okay.",
            "I think this is completely not right, the government should not interfere with religious views. I think this should not be something that the government can declare as legal. I think this issue should be decided by the churches because even in the constitution, it is said that church and state should be separated. This is very clear, very clear. If the government tries to exert any power over it, this would be a direct defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution, which is already engraved in stone. So, those who want to make this issue legal I think are choosing one church's belief over another. Just like we see most Catholics, Catholics and Christians are against it and do not support it, except in Boston and some areas. But I don't think this is something that the government should decide what the churches are allowed to make legal and what they are not. This is very strange. Well, the separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, which has guaranteed religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to amend the constitution, I think it's completely wrong to even amend it about this issue, and it's contradictory to what is already stated in the constitution. And I also think it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts people's rights rather than the government's rights. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. I don't think the federal government or any government institution should interfere with this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a bias towards a certain religion over every other religion. So I really think this should be decided by the churches, not the president or anyone in government in particular. And there's no reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to affect the economy or anything else. If anything, it might boost it, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society rather than not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I believe that the government was not completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself am almost against war \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I am against \nUh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in some ways a repeat of Vietnam \nA repeat of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUh \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUh\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I've always supported gay marriage. I've always been. This is a very personal thing, and now more and more research shows that orientation is biological rather than social, so we shouldn't deprive them of their rights due to something they can't control. \n\nIn my opinion, this is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government shouldn't have any role in this; this is not a national issue, it's a personal issue, it's a household issue. In my neighborhood at home, I know there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street just like anyone else. I think Bush is trying to redefine marriage and interpret the words the way he wants. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nActually, research shows that there's a chemical thing in your brain that might make you homosexual. It's not because of environment or social influence, so that's a biological issue, not a social one.\n\nHowever, aside from the obvious, I think another issue is that marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can secretly go to Las Vegas and do it, but if two guys want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal and private affair, rather than a public or national issue.",
            "Uh, when you put something on the internet, it's like a public forum. It's completely public. You can't do anything about it. I mean, as an RA, I've actually dealt with this before. Uh, when you put something out there, it affects how people think of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there; you can't put that out to the whole world. The internet is seen by everyone. If your friend on Myspace gets that bulletin, obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to take action. They can't just let it be because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it. But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that someone overheard someone saying something in school, and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, his friend looked through his Facebook and became very worried because there were some certain things on there that he might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, those things became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't control what they think. You can't control what people take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone who you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different story. Uh, yeah. Like, a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my job, so I don't want that kind of connection. Um, not really.",
            "I feel the war has been dragged out too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nTo restore democracy in another country. \nHowever, I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. \nNow, we are acting only to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think the original motivation was influenced by George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo, if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but not if there were personal interests involved. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. That was a statement in itself. \nHowever, the war has lasted for over a year or even several years, and I think it's just too long. \n\nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country under a tyrant's rule, I think that's a just reason for the war. \nBut I don't think our reason has been misunderstood and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, not to end the war. \nWe don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long, and it should end. \nTheir government officials will have to take care of themselves anyway. \nI think it's time for that. \nWe've drained our economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be spending money on. \nI think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long been extended. \n\nI mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term budget item. \nThere are other things, like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, healthcare, that we have a lot of problems funding, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification on that. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what. Hum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of. Yes.",

            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example. Not really.",
            "I think they didn't completely legalize it, they decriminalized it. You know, it went from a criminal offense to like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that, and then have to come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and have to pay the judge and the state attorney's office has to take on the charge and basically press the charges, and that's a lot of money. So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana, they don't want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. \n\nI think it's important because marijuana isn't something you just want out and about everywhere all over the streets and stuff, there's a whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized are well, if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it's still kind of taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana. To have it out in the open like that would just be awkward to a lot of people. \n\nAnd I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills, I mean, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, they both are bad in their own way, but I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it's hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes because\nThey do a lot of traditional things, like they've been doing the same things for a long time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. Um, many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done, and sometimes the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no, I'm sorry, my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd um, that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's a child, which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. But I think this is the most difficult issue we're facing today, because separating church and state and defining marriage is very tricky. So I don't know, I think all civil unions, I'm not sure how marriage should be viewed. If it's considered a sacred sacrament like religion, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government in any way. So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people in union, no need to separate church and state, no need to ask what kind of marriage it is. Two people got together. So I think gay marriage is just two people in a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states could come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution. It's not big enough of an issue to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. To put it simply.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends, I don't agree with that lifestyle entirely. I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Many states are Democratic, and many are Republican, so Democratic states will naturally support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you will know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you have the right to disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you chose to live there, so you should respect the state's decision. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I have already answered that. I don't think Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it; I don't agree with his ban. I just think that since Bush doesn't live in every single state, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. I think some things should be left to each individual state. He'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I don't agree at all Um Let's see, Myspace is a public thing, a bulletin board You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see Um whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet Um you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that whether it be school officials or not Um so in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes Um but uh yeah with something preventing a school shooting you know as long as it saves the lives of uh students which is a responsibility of the school system I think that's perfectly fine Um let me see here like if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy but Um I feel as though you know as long as they save you know save lives or make the school a better and safer place I don't think that that's an invasion at all Um should I elaborate more on that Yeah um alright well Um like what I was saying it is a public thing Um and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble that's ridiculous Um everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails Um like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know bites you in the butt I guess you could say Um like you know if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow and like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and Um you know if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it you will get in trouble and I don't it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know like I said before and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and Um I don't know let's see here Um like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place Um then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or Um other officials such as the police to go on Um you know when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though you know they're dropping them off at a safe place I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine I went to a public high school and Um they say you know we have to ensure stuff like this because like we would do like lock downs and stuff and Um that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks uh we had to be safe about that we had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because Um that was incase people would come into the building I guess Um so we you know we did practice that stuff Um in order to make the school a safer place and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case they were just making it a safer place Um preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that Um yeah that's basically all I can come up with",
            "Initially, I supported the invasion of Iraq. However, the 9/11 event affected me, and I thought we should go there and create chaos like that. But I think we didn't think about the long-term consequences, and we went there unprepared. I think our actions failed. Now, I am completely against the invasion of Iraq. I think our past actions didn't produce any real effects. I think as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us. I don't think our existence in Iraq will make any difference, because they can't even live in harmony with themselves. Due to the 9/11 event, I've almost lost interest in what's happening in Iraq. I don't care about those people. I just think they're normal in fighting with other countries, but can't get along with themselves. So, I don't care about them. I don't think we can change them. I don't think we can change the system in Iraq. I think we should leave Iraq immediately. I think we invaded Iraq just for revenge. I think President Bush decided to invade Iraq because the people asked him to. I think he made a mistake. I think we should at least know what we're doing. I think we didn't prepare enough for the invasion. I think we didn't establish a unified will. I think we didn't make a thorough plan for our actions. I think we didn't prepare for the future. Therefore, our result is not satisfactory. I think we should leave Iraq, and let the situation stabilize. Therefore, I think we should leave Iraq immediately."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few ways. They have many people talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things.\n\nIn the case of gay marriage, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine. But their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard there are a lot of people starting to have a little bit of a negative view of the Catholic Church because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nYeah, I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong, and that you were going against it. And the same goes with gay marriage and things like that - if that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know if they would have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, I don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God, and they're devoted to their complete life. But I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they're devoted to. So I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nNo.",
            "Personally, I don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think, no matter if you're born that way or not, sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. Like, I was born straight, and another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be responsible for, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this. It's not really a legal issue, and I don't think it's a moral issue either. I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal and judged for their sexual orientation. So I don't think the federal government really has a say in this. \n\nIt's complicated. (laughs) I don't think the federal government should get involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it's not a moral concern, it's not like anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people. That's just how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and they shouldn't be punished for that. No, that's it.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. If it's available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. \n\nYou know, there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percoet. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of these just because there's a taboo around marijuana doesn't make sense to me. We should accept its benefits.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, it can still have negative effects, just like alcohol. But it's a tough one. I say, let's integrate it, let it become legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, not like heroin or cocaine. If we get rid of the image of marijuana as a horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. I think the church is not as strict as it used to be. I know that even though I've grown up, when I was a kid, I always went to church every Sunday. I would wear cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just a part of going to church. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends at church on the weekends. We would just go to church. But as I've gotten older, they've set up a teenager mass, and they've shortened the mass to 30 minutes. People dress more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families running late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at morning mass, I used to always dress up. People are now wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing that I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church. But yeah, that's it. [Okay, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could've been avoided. Because there are married men who still become pedophiles. They still have an attraction to young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. I think there are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [man] he is, but he's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [Okay, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, I was going to say... about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think... like, the whole thing about sexuality being related to genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people can just become pedophiles. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with how they're raised. It might have something to do in some cases, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through marriage. You can try, but it usually comes out. So I don't think the church could've done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, that's shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. [Okay, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "(laughs)\nUm, I initially was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false. And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. Um, I think that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact, even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it. And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I was wondering if I should just talk about it? Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq. I don't keep up with it, I don't know the details, but at this point, I know we're just staying there to try and build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and also to get oil and stuff from them. But that's no reason for staying there because it's making everyone upset. So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say, I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States, that it's going to be even worse for them, and it's going to be like, I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them, and they've been going on this whole like a totalitarian, like a whole dictatorship thing for so long, that you know, I feel like it's going to, that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there, so I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years, hmm, that's about it, okay.",

I think this issue should be decided by the churches because even in the constitution, it is said that church and state should be separated. This is very clear, very clear. If the government tries to exert any power over it, this would be a direct defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution, which is already engraved in stone. So, those who want to make this issue legal I think are choosing one church's belief over another. Just like we see most Catholics, Catholics and Christians are against it and do not support it, except in Boston and some areas. But I don't think this is something that the government should decide what the churches are allowed to make legal and what they are not. This is very strange. Well, the separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, which has guaranteed religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to amend the constitution, I think it's completely wrong to even amend it about this issue, and it's contradictory to what is already stated in the constitution. And I also think it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts people's rights rather than the government's rights. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. I don't think the federal government or any government institution should interfere with this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a bias towards a certain religion over every other religion. So I really think this should be decided by the churches, not the president or anyone in government in particular. And there's no reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to affect the economy or anything else. If anything, it might boost it, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society rather than not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I believe that the government was not completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself am almost against war \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I am against \nUh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in some ways a repeat of Vietnam \nA repeat of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUh \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUh\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I've always supported gay marriage. I've always been. This is a very personal thing, and now more and more research shows that orientation is biological rather than social, so we shouldn't deprive them of their rights due to something they can't control. \n\nIn my opinion, this is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government shouldn't have any role in this; this is not a national issue, it's a personal issue, it's a household issue. In my neighborhood at home, I know there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street just like anyone else. I think Bush is trying to redefine marriage and interpret the words the way he wants. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nActually, research shows that there's a chemical thing in your brain that might make you homosexual. It's not because of environment or social influence, so that's a biological issue, not a social one.\n\nHowever, aside from the obvious, I think another issue is that marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can secretly go to Las Vegas and do it, but if two guys want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal and private affair, rather than a public or national issue.",
            "Uh, when you put something on the internet, it's like a public forum. It's completely public. You can't do anything about it. I mean, as an RA, I've actually dealt with this before. Uh, when you put something out there, it affects how people think of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there; you can't put that out to the whole world. The internet is seen by everyone. If your friend on Myspace gets that bulletin, obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to take action. They can't just let it be because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it. But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that someone overheard someone saying something in school, and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, his friend looked through his Facebook and became very worried because there were some certain things on there that he might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, those things became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't control what they think. You can't control what people take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone who you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different story. Uh, yeah. Like, a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my job, so I don't want that kind of connection. Um, not really.",
            "I feel the war has been dragged out too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nTo restore democracy in another country. \nHowever, I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. \nNow, we are acting only to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think the original motivation was influenced by George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo, if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but not if there were personal interests involved. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. That was a statement in itself. \nHowever, the war has lasted for over a year or even several years, and I think it's just too long. \n\nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country under a tyrant's rule, I think that's a just reason for the war. \nBut I don't think our reason has been misunderstood and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, not to end the war. \nWe don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long, and it should end. \nTheir government officials will have to take care of themselves anyway. \nI think it's time for that. \nWe've drained our economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be spending money on. \nI think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long been extended. \n\nI mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term budget item. \nThere are other things, like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, healthcare, that we have a lot of problems funding, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification on that. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what. Hum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of. Yes.",

            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example. Not really.",
            "I think they didn't completely legalize it, they decriminalized it. You know, it went from a criminal offense to like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that, and then have to come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and have to pay the judge and the state attorney's office has to take on the charge and basically press the charges, and that's a lot of money. So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana, they don't want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. \n\nI think it's important because marijuana isn't something you just want out and about everywhere all over the streets and stuff, there's a whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized are well, if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it's still kind of taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana. To have it out in the open like that would just be awkward to a lot of people. \n\nAnd I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills, I mean, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, they both are bad in their own way, but I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it's hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes because\nThey do a lot of traditional things, like they've been doing the same things for a long time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. Um, many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done, and sometimes the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no, I'm sorry, my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd um, that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's a child, which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. But I think this is the most difficult issue we're facing today, because separating church and state and defining marriage is very tricky. So I don't know, I think all civil unions, I'm not sure how marriage should be viewed. If it's considered a sacred sacrament like religion, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government in any way. So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people in union, no need to separate church and state, no need to ask what kind of marriage it is. Two people got together. So I think gay marriage is just two people in a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states could come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution. It's not big enough of an issue to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. To put it simply.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends, I don't agree with that lifestyle entirely. I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Many states are Democratic, and many are Republican, so Democratic states will naturally support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you will know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you have the right to disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you chose to live there, so you should respect the state's decision. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I have already answered that. I don't think Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it; I don't agree with his ban. I just think that since Bush doesn't live in every single state, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. I think some things should be left to each individual state. He'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I don't agree at all Um Let's see, Myspace is a public thing, a bulletin board You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see Um whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet Um you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that whether it be school officials or not Um so in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes Um but uh yeah with something preventing a school shooting you know as long as it saves the lives of uh students which is a responsibility of the school system I think that's perfectly fine Um let me see here like if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy but Um I feel as though you know as long as they save you know save lives or make the school a better and safer place I don't think that that's an invasion at all Um should I elaborate more on that Yeah um alright well Um like what I was saying it is a public thing Um and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble that's ridiculous Um everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails Um like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know bites you in the butt I guess you could say Um like you know if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow and like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and Um you know if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it you will get in trouble and I don't it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know like I said before and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and Um I don't know let's see here Um like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place Um then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or Um other officials such as the police to go on Um you know when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though you know they're dropping them off at a safe place I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine I went to a public high school and Um they say you know we have to ensure stuff like this because like we would do like lock downs and stuff and Um that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks uh we had to be safe about that we had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because Um that was incase people would come into the building I guess Um so we you know we did practice that stuff Um in order to make the school a safer place and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case they were just making it a safer place Um preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that Um yeah that's basically all I can come up with",
            "Initially, I supported the invasion of Iraq. However, the 9/11 event affected me, and I thought we should go there and create chaos like that. But I think we didn't think about the long-term consequences, and we went there unprepared. I think our actions failed. Now, I am completely against the invasion of Iraq. I think our past actions didn't produce any real effects. I think as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us. I don't think our existence in Iraq will make any difference, because they can't even live in harmony with themselves. Due to the 9/11 event, I've almost lost interest in what's happening in Iraq. I don't care about those people. I just think they're normal in fighting with other countries, but can't get along with themselves. So, I don't care about them. I don't think we can change them. I don't think we can change the system in Iraq. I think we should leave Iraq immediately. I think we invaded Iraq just for revenge. I think President Bush decided to invade Iraq because the people asked him to. I think he made a mistake. I think we should at least know what we're doing. I think we didn't prepare enough for the invasion. I think we didn't establish a unified will. I think we didn't make a thorough plan for our actions. I think we didn't prepare for the future. Therefore, our result is not satisfactory. I think we should leave Iraq, and let the situation stabilize. Therefore, I think we should leave Iraq immediately."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few ways. They have many people talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things.\n\nIn the case of gay marriage, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine. But their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard there are a lot of people starting to have a little bit of a negative view of the Catholic Church because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nYeah, I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong, and that you were going against it. And the same goes with gay marriage and things like that - if that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know if they would have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, I don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God, and they're devoted to their complete life. But I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they're devoted to. So I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nNo.",
            "Personally, I don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think, no matter if you're born that way or not, sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. Like, I was born straight, and another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be responsible for, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this. It's not really a legal issue, and I don't think it's a moral issue either. I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal and judged for their sexual orientation. So I don't think the federal government really has a say in this. \n\nIt's complicated. (laughs) I don't think the federal government should get involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it's not a moral concern, it's not like anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people. That's just how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and they shouldn't be punished for that. No, that's it.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. If it's available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. \n\nYou know, there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percoet. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of these just because there's a taboo around marijuana doesn't make sense to me. We should accept its benefits.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, it can still have negative effects, just like alcohol. But it's a tough one. I say, let's integrate it, let it become legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, not like heroin or cocaine. If we get rid of the image of marijuana as a horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. I think the church is not as strict as it used to be. I know that even though I've grown up, when I was a kid, I always went to church every Sunday. I would wear cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just a part of going to church. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends at church on the weekends. We would just go to church. But as I've gotten older, they've set up a teenager mass, and they've shortened the mass to 30 minutes. People dress more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families running late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at morning mass, I used to always dress up. People are now wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing that I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church. But yeah, that's it. [Okay, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could've been avoided. Because there are married men who still become pedophiles. They still have an attraction to young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. I think there are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [man] he is, but he's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [Okay, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, I was going to say... about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think... like, the whole thing about sexuality being related to genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people can just become pedophiles. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with how they're raised. It might have something to do in some cases, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through marriage. You can try, but it usually comes out. So I don't think the church could've done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, that's shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. [Okay, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "(laughs)\nUm, I initially was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false. And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. Um, I think that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact, even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it. And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I was wondering if I should just talk about it? Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq. I don't keep up with it, I don't know the details, but at this point, I know we're just staying there to try and build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and also to get oil and stuff from them. But that's no reason for staying there because it's making everyone upset. So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say, I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States, that it's going to be even worse for them, and it's going to be like, I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them, and they've been going on this whole like a totalitarian, like a whole dictatorship thing for so long, that you know, I feel like it's going to, that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there, so I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years, hmm, that's about it, okay.",

I think this issue should be decided by the churches because even in the constitution, it is said that church and state should be separated. This is very clear, very clear. If the government tries to exert any power over it, this would be a direct defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution, which is already engraved in stone. So, those who want to make this issue legal I think are choosing one church's belief over another. Just like we see most Catholics, Catholics and Christians are against it and do not support it, except in Boston and some areas. But I don't think this is something that the government should decide what the churches are allowed to make legal and what they are not. This is very strange. Well, the separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, which has guaranteed religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to amend the constitution, I think it's completely wrong to even amend it about this issue, and it's contradictory to what is already stated in the constitution. And I also think it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts people's rights rather than the government's rights. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. I don't think the federal government or any government institution should interfere with this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a bias towards a certain religion over every other religion. So I really think this should be decided by the churches, not the president or anyone in government in particular. And there's no reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to affect the economy or anything else. If anything, it might boost it, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society rather than not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I believe that the government was not completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself am almost against war \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I am against \nUh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in some ways a repeat of Vietnam \nA repeat of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUh \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUh\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I've always supported gay marriage. I've always been. This is a very personal thing, and now more and more research shows that orientation is biological rather than social, so we shouldn't deprive them of their rights due to something they can't control. \n\nIn my opinion, this is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government shouldn't have any role in this; this is not a national issue, it's a personal issue, it's a household issue. In my neighborhood at home, I know there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street just like anyone else. I think Bush is trying to redefine marriage and interpret the words the way he wants. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nActually, research shows that there's a chemical thing in your brain that might make you homosexual. It's not because of environment or social influence, so that's a biological issue, not a social one.\n\nHowever, aside from the obvious, I think another issue is that marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can secretly go to Las Vegas and do it, but if two guys want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal and private affair, rather than a public or national issue.",
            "Uh, when you put something on the internet, it's like a public forum. It's completely public. You can't do anything about it. I mean, as an RA, I've actually dealt with this before. Uh, when you put something out there, it affects how people think of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there; you can't put that out to the whole world. The internet is seen by everyone. If your friend on Myspace gets that bulletin, obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to take action. They can't just let it be because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it. But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that someone overheard someone saying something in school, and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, his friend looked through his Facebook and became very worried because there were some certain things on there that he might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, those things became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't control what they think. You can't control what people take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone who you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different story. Uh, yeah. Like, a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my job, so I don't want that kind of connection. Um, not really.",
            "I feel the war has been dragged out too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nTo restore democracy in another country. \nHowever, I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. \nNow, we are acting only to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think the original motivation was influenced by George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo, if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but not if there were personal interests involved. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. That was a statement in itself. \nHowever, the war has lasted for over a year or even several years, and I think it's just too long. \n\nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country under a tyrant's rule, I think that's a just reason for the war. \nBut I don't think our reason has been misunderstood and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, not to end the war. \nWe don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long, and it should end. \nTheir government officials will have to take care of themselves anyway. \nI think it's time for that. \nWe've drained our economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be spending money on. \nI think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long been extended. \n\nI mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term budget item. \nThere are other things, like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, healthcare, that we have a lot of problems funding, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification on that. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what. Hum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of. Yes.",

            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example. Not really.",
            "I think they didn't completely legalize it, they decriminalized it. You know, it went from a criminal offense to like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that, and then have to come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and have to pay the judge and the state attorney's office has to take on the charge and basically press the charges, and that's a lot of money. So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana, they don't want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. \n\nI think it's important because marijuana isn't something you just want out and about everywhere all over the streets and stuff, there's a whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized are well, if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it's still kind of taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana. To have it out in the open like that would just be awkward to a lot of people. \n\nAnd I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills, I mean, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, they both are bad in their own way, but I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it's hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes because\nThey do a lot of traditional things, like they've been doing the same things for a long time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. Um, many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done, and sometimes the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no, I'm sorry, my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd um, that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's a child, which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. But I think this is the most difficult issue we're facing today, because separating church and state and defining marriage is very tricky. So I don't know, I think all civil unions, I'm not sure how marriage should be viewed. If it's considered a sacred sacrament like religion, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government in any way. So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people in union, no need to separate church and state, no need to ask what kind of marriage it is. Two people got together. So I think gay marriage is just two people in a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states could come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution. It's not big enough of an issue to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. To put it simply.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends, I don't agree with that lifestyle entirely. I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Many states are Democratic, and many are Republican, so Democratic states will naturally support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you will know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you have the right to disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you chose to live there, so you should respect the state's decision. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I have already answered that. I don't think Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it; I don't agree with his ban. I just think that since Bush doesn't live in every single state, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. I think some things should be left to each individual state. He'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I don't agree at all Um Let's see, Myspace is a public thing, a bulletin board You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see Um whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet Um you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that whether it be school officials or not Um so in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes Um but uh yeah with something preventing a school shooting you know as long as it saves the lives of uh students which is a responsibility of the school system I think that's perfectly fine Um let me see here like if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy but Um I feel as though you know as long as they save you know save lives or make the school a better and safer place I don't think that that's an invasion at all Um should I elaborate more on that Yeah um alright well Um like what I was saying it is a public thing Um and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble that's ridiculous Um everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails Um like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know bites you in the butt I guess you could say Um like you know if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow and like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and Um you know if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it you will get in trouble and I don't it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know like I said before and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and Um I don't know let's see here Um like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place Um then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or Um other officials such as the police to go on Um you know when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though you know they're dropping them off at a safe place I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine I went to a public high school and Um they say you know we have to ensure stuff like this because like we would do like lock downs and stuff and Um that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks uh we had to be safe about that we had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because Um that was incase people would come into the building I guess Um so we you know we did practice that stuff Um in order to make the school a safer place and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case they were just making it a safer place Um preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that Um yeah that's basically all I can come up with",
            "Initially, I supported the invasion of Iraq. However, the 9/11 event affected me, and I thought we should go there and create chaos like that. But I think we didn't think about the long-term consequences, and we went there unprepared. I think our actions failed. Now, I am completely against the invasion of Iraq. I think our past actions didn't produce any real effects. I think as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us. I don't think our existence in Iraq will make any difference, because they can't even live in harmony with themselves. Due to the 9/11 event, I've almost lost interest in what's happening in Iraq. I don't care about those people. I just think they're normal in fighting with other countries, but can't get along with themselves. So, I don't care about them. I don't think we can change them. I don't think we can change the system in Iraq. I think we should leave Iraq immediately. I think we invaded Iraq just for revenge. I think President Bush decided to invade Iraq because the people asked him to. I think he made a mistake. I think we should at least know what we're doing. I think we didn't prepare enough for the invasion. I think we didn't establish a unified will. I think we didn't make a thorough plan for our actions. I think we didn't prepare for the future. Therefore, our result is not satisfactory. I think we should leave Iraq, and let the situation stabilize. Therefore, I think we should leave Iraq immediately."
