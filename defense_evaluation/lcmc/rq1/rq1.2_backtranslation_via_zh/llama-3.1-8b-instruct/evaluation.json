            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think people's sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think gay people shouldn't be blamed for their sexual orientation. I think it's unfair. Because they don't choose their sexual orientation. I think sexual orientation isn't an option. People can't choose whether they're gay or straight. I'm straight, another person is gay, that's how they're born. I think it's not a conscious choice. So I think they shouldn't be blamed. I think the government shouldn't interfere with this issue because it's not a legal issue. It's not a moral issue either. I don't think it's a national security issue. The government shouldn't interfere with personal matters. Everyone should have the right to choose their own life. Gay people should be treated with dignity and respect.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's completely different. Gay marriage has many aspects, and it can't be compared to heterosexual marriage. It's like two sides of the same coin - it will never be the other side. However, it's still the same thing. Gay couples have a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where their partner can't be in the room with them if they're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and gay couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people, like Catholics, can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that kind of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners, and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples, and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new, and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers, and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view, and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so, they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion, and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical, to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the morality of others is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under god in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects, instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making the drug available to the public, I would say no. Absolutely not. However, for medical purposes, I would say yes. Because, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It doesn't have benefits, you know what I mean. \n\nYes, I mean that there are many drugs that are illegal that are used in pharmacies. Like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet – those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, that's just not right. You should accept its benefits, I think. \n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if abused, can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol, it can also lead to bad things. It's a tough call. I'd say not. You could integrate it gradually, like make it legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused but if you just had to remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. \n\nUh, yes, I mean people have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we got rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes. No",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was every weekend I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there. And we would just go. But now as I've gotten older, they've made the mass for teenagers. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. You'd see the families running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also, when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. I don't know what kind of minister or reverend he is, but they allow them to get married. So I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, which part? About... [Um] Just the changing ways. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about the pedophilia. [Mm hmm.] Um, I think, like, the whole... [Um] Sexuality is before about being genetic. I think it's genetic. I don't think people just become that way. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] Um, no.",
            "I was initially okay with the premise of the Iraq war, but I think that the repercussions of the 9/11 attacks were still very much lingering, and we went to war in Iraq under a pretext, with many indications that we had already been moving towards Iraq. I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government. And I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I want to say something.\nMmhmm\nJust say anything?\nOkay\nOkay, that's cool\nUmum\nI'm sorry\nOkay\nLet's talk about how I feel about the Iraq War.\nLet me think\nAt this point, I think it's pointless because it wasn't even declared a war.\nI think it's just to get back at Iraq because we think they did the 9/11 attack.\nSo I don't think it's a reason for anything.\nI mean, I'm not a big person on the War in Iraq.\nSo I don't really keep up with it.\nI don't know the details of it.\nBut I do know that we're staying there to try to build a democracy, so it can become like another U.S. thing.\nAnd also to get oil and resources from them.\nBut that's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone mad.\nSo if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try to build a democracy, which takes forever because you can't build a democracy in just a day.\nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.\nUm let me think\nThis is a really hard topic\nThis is one topic I don't know anything about\nUm Iraq War\nOh this is hard\nUh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay thanks\nUm Well actually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think\nYou know\nThe only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it was never declared a war by Congress\nI think that's how it works\nYou have to declare a war by Congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOkay",
            "Uh\nI really don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. \nI believe it's entirely up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that it's right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "The Iraq War\nOkay\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nStarting from the beginning, I think the US government did not completely honestly tell the American people the reasons for invading Iraq\nBefore invading Iraq, I thought\nI thought they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks\nHowever, they were not really related to each other\nBut the government made it seem that way, and utilized the outrage of the American people over the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq, which started in 2003\nOkay\nI\nI myself and pretty much everyone else are against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against it\nOkay\nI think the Iraq War is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War\nThe US government should learn from past mistakes\nI think\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died\n\nThis is horrible\nWhat they were\nWhat they were doing was\nThey were removing the country's government\nI really don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur\nOkay\nAnd the US government\nAnd the US government removed the Iraqi government\nThey are trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq\nThis is similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd to implement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nBecause\nBecause\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country\nSpecific citizens in the country\nSo\nSo I think\nI think the government\nSo I think the government\nIf you're going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government\nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there's still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that\nThat the US government wasn't prepared, in a way, tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a\nA short, successful invasion of Iraq\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda\nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was a lot of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nThat's\nNo that's\nNo that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started and\nAnd so I mean once you're in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them\nAbandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we get our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference and uh, and it's been proven more and more now that it could be biological, as opposed to sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control. Um, because they can't control it. I think it's inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any reason for politics and government to have any part in this. It's not even on a state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. You know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way any other family would, you know, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that, uh, Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way that he wants to, I think it's ridiculous.\n\nCertainly, yes, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different, uh, publications and TV reports or newspapers, whatever, on that, it's something now that's been proven to be a chemical thing in your brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual. As opposed to, uh, growing up and you know, maybe with like four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side, opposed to sociological.\n\nUm, well, other than that, I guess the obvious reason is that, uh, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person just go to, uh, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of, uh, the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, uh, sector-type thing, opposed to, uh, public domain and, uh, national, uh, federal domain.\n\nUh, no, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, that's a different story altogether. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and partying and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I'd have to take action. That's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Not really.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nBut I think we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. \nNow we might just be doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think maybe the original motive was already questionable, related to George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo I think \nIf the original motivation was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a fair motivation if there weren't any personal interests involved. I don't think it would be fair if there were personal interests. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months of the war; that was a statement in itself. \nBut the fact that it's been going on for over a year or several years, I think it's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I think \nI mean, if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think \nI think our reason has become distorted and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYeah, I do think it's been going on long enough, and it should stop. \nI mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. \nAnd I think that time has come. \nWe've been spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems at home, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously other things we need to fund, such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads, anything dealing with schools, healthcare. \nWe certainly have a lot of problems to fund those things, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money's being spent to kill some of our own citizens in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",

I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't want to join the bandwagon of people who are like, 'I was against it from the beginning.' Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore. Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean, no, like 75 to 80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. 80% of Iraqis, um, 70% of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should withdraw within the year. Um, I don't know. It's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster. And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy. I don't think anyone's arguing that he's not. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll I mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

            "I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender. I don't know, I guess that's another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because their many things are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I think this is one of the most complicated issues we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are very delicate issues. And it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone. So, I don't know what I'm thinking. I think all civil unions are... I don't know if marriage should be looked at as defined by the government because it's considered a sacrament, so people get tax breaks or looked at in a certain way by the government if they were baptized. And if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is - two people. They shouldn't have the separation of church and state, and they shouldn't care about what kind of marriage it was - two people got united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people who got a civil union. Um, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's something that the constitution shouldn't be amended for just because it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage, simply put. Uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be decided by each state rather than the president. Many states are democratic and many are republican. Obviously, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you naturally know how that state feels about that issue. And if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you have the right to disagree with that decision because you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that. But I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in about two years. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should be up to each state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "Um, I don't completely agree. I think it's like this. Let's see. I'm trying to figure it out. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know it's basically for the public or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I feel like school officials seeing that, they have every right to see it. Because even if they weren't posting it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system. I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on the internet like on MySpace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel like, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, um, alright, well, um, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing a lot longer. But, um, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email, because I'm afraid someone will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and um, you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\nUm, like I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and um, they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lockdowns, and stuff, and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drills and stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because um, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Well \nUh, \nThe war \nUh, \nAt first, I supported the invasion because I was personally affected by 9/11 \nUh, \nI thought we should do the same thing here, create as much chaos as they did here \nUh, \nI think because 9/11 was an emotional thing, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences \nWe went there unprepared, no plan, \nUh, \nI think it backfired on us \nUh, \nI don't know \nI was all for it then, but now I'm completely against it \nI don't think it achieved anything \nUh, \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us \nLike, I don't think our being there will make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves \nSo uh, \nBecause of 9/11, I'm almost apathetic about what's going on over there \nUh, \nWith those people, I just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think they're human \nI don't know \nThey're just fighting with each other and can't do anything \nUh, \nI really don't care \nUh, \nI don't know \nWe went over there completely unprepared, without any idea of what we'd face \nUh, \nIt's also bad because war is very different for them than it is for us \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're trying to improve their country \nI just think they want us to leave \nAnd I think that's fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that's it \nUh, \nI think we were just hyped up, not thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nUh, \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd uh, \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUh, \nBut at the time, I understood where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it \nSo \nUh, \nI don't think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order \nAnd I don't know \nI just think that they didn't \nThere was no unity \nThey didn't know what they were going into \nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that's what we created in turn in there \nUh, \nHonestly, I don't \nI don't think we're the ones to change those people \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that \nAnd uh, \nI don't \nI really don't have anything else to say \nIt's gone on for too long \nUh, \nI don't think we're making enough progress \nWe've made some progress, but not enough to stay there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there \nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse \nAnd we can't stay over there forever \nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nWell"

you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think people's sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think gay people shouldn't be blamed for their sexual orientation. I think it's unfair. Because they don't choose their sexual orientation. I think sexual orientation isn't an option. People can't choose whether they're gay or straight. I'm straight, another person is gay, that's how they're born. I think it's not a conscious choice. So I think they shouldn't be blamed. I think the government shouldn't interfere with this issue because it's not a legal issue. It's not a moral issue either. I don't think it's a national security issue. The government shouldn't interfere with personal matters. Everyone should have the right to choose their own life. Gay people should be treated with dignity and respect.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's completely different. Gay marriage has many aspects, and it can't be compared to heterosexual marriage. It's like two sides of the same coin - it will never be the other side. However, it's still the same thing. Gay couples have a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where their partner can't be in the room with them if they're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and gay couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people, like Catholics, can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that kind of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners, and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples, and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new, and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers, and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view, and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so, they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion, and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical, to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the morality of others is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under god in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects, instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making the drug available to the public, I would say no. Absolutely not. However, for medical purposes, I would say yes. Because, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It doesn't have benefits, you know what I mean. \n\nYes, I mean that there are many drugs that are illegal that are used in pharmacies. Like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet – those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, that's just not right. You should accept its benefits, I think. \n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if abused, can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol, it can also lead to bad things. It's a tough call. I'd say not. You could integrate it gradually, like make it legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused but if you just had to remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. \n\nUh, yes, I mean people have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we got rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes. No",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was every weekend I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there. And we would just go. But now as I've gotten older, they've made the mass for teenagers. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. You'd see the families running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also, when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. I don't know what kind of minister or reverend he is, but they allow them to get married. So I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, which part? About... [Um] Just the changing ways. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about the pedophilia. [Mm hmm.] Um, I think, like, the whole... [Um] Sexuality is before about being genetic. I think it's genetic. I don't think people just become that way. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] Um, no.",
            "I was initially okay with the premise of the Iraq war, but I think that the repercussions of the 9/11 attacks were still very much lingering, and we went to war in Iraq under a pretext, with many indications that we had already been moving towards Iraq. I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.

            "Uh\nI really don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. \nI believe it's entirely up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that it's right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "The Iraq War\nOkay\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nStarting from the beginning, I think the US government did not completely honestly tell the American people the reasons for invading Iraq\nBefore invading Iraq, I thought\nI thought they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks\nHowever, they were not really related to each other\nBut the government made it seem that way, and utilized the outrage of the American people over the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq, which started in 2003\nOkay\nI\nI myself and pretty much everyone else are against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against it\nOkay\nI think the Iraq War is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War\nThe US government should learn from past mistakes\nI think\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died\n\nThis is horrible\nWhat they were\nWhat they were doing was\nThey were removing the country's government\nI really don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur\nOkay\nAnd the US government\nAnd the US government removed the Iraqi government\nThey are trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq\nThis is similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd to implement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nBecause\nBecause\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country\nSpecific citizens in the country\nSo\nSo I think\nI think the government\nSo I think the government\nIf you're going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government\nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there's still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that\nThat the US government wasn't prepared, in a way, tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a\nA short, successful invasion of Iraq\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda\nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was a lot of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nThat's\nNo that's\nNo that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started and\nAnd so I mean once you're in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them\nAbandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we get our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference and uh, and it's been proven more and more now that it could be biological, as opposed to sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control. Um, because they can't control it. I think it's inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any reason for politics and government to have any part in this. It's not even on a state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. You know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way any other family would, you know, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that, uh, Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way that he wants to, I think it's ridiculous.\n\nCertainly, yes, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different, uh, publications and TV reports or newspapers, whatever, on that, it's something now that's been proven to be a chemical thing in your brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual. As opposed to, uh, growing up and you know, maybe with like four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side, opposed to sociological.\n\nUm, well, other than that, I guess the obvious reason is that, uh, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person just go to, uh, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of, uh, the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, uh, sector-type thing, opposed to, uh, public domain and, uh, national, uh, federal domain.\n\nUh, no, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, that's a different story altogether. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and partying and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I'd have to take action. That's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Not really.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nBut I think we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. \nNow we might just be doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think maybe the original motive was already questionable, related to George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo I think \nIf the original motivation was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a fair motivation if there weren't any personal interests involved. I don't think it would be fair if there were personal interests. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months of the war; that was a statement in itself. \nBut the fact that it's been going on for over a year or several years, I think it's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I think \nI mean, if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think \nI think our reason has become distorted and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYeah, I do think it's been going on long enough, and it should stop. \nI mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. \nAnd I think that time has come. \nWe've been spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems at home, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously other things we need to fund, such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads, anything dealing with schools, healthcare. \nWe certainly have a lot of problems to fund those things, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money's being spent to kill some of our own citizens in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",

I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't want to join the bandwagon of people who are like, 'I was against it from the beginning.' Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore. Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean, no, like 75 to 80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. 80% of Iraqis, um, 70% of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should withdraw within the year. Um, I don't know. It's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster. And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy. I don't think anyone's arguing that he's not. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll I mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

            "I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender. I don't know, I guess that's another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because their many things are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I think this is one of the most complicated issues we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are very delicate issues. And it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone. So, I don't know what I'm thinking. I think all civil unions are... I don't know if marriage should be looked at as defined by the government because it's considered a sacrament, so people get tax breaks or looked at in a certain way by the government if they were baptized. And if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is - two people. They shouldn't have the separation of church and state, and they shouldn't care about what kind of marriage it was - two people got united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people who got a civil union. Um, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's something that the constitution shouldn't be amended for just because it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage, simply put. Uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be decided by each state rather than the president. Many states are democratic and many are republican. Obviously, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you naturally know how that state feels about that issue. And if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you have the right to disagree with that decision because you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that. But I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in about two years. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should be up to each state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "Um, I don't completely agree. I think it's like this. Let's see. I'm trying to figure it out. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know it's basically for the public or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I feel like school officials seeing that, they have every right to see it. Because even if they weren't posting it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system. I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on the internet like on MySpace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel like, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, um, alright, well, um, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing a lot longer. But, um, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email, because I'm afraid someone will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and um, you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\nUm, like I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and um, they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lockdowns, and stuff, and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drills and stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because um, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Well \nUh, \nThe war \nUh, \nAt first, I supported the invasion because I was personally affected by 9/11 \nUh, \nI thought we should do the same thing here, create as much chaos as they did here \nUh, \nI think because 9/11 was an emotional thing, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences \nWe went there unprepared, no plan, \nUh, \nI think it backfired on us \nUh, \nI don't know \nI was all for it then, but now I'm completely against it \nI don't think it achieved anything \nUh, \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us \nLike, I don't think our being there will make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves \nSo uh, \nBecause of 9/11, I'm almost apathetic about what's going on over there \nUh, \nWith those people, I just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think they're human \nI don't know \nThey're just fighting with each other and can't do anything \nUh, \nI really don't care \nUh, \nI don't know \nWe went over there completely unprepared, without any idea of what we'd face \nUh, \nIt's also bad because war is very different for them than it is for us \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're trying to improve their country \nI just think they want us to leave \nAnd I think that's fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that's it \nUh, \nI think we were just hyped up, not thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nUh, \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd uh, \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUh, \nBut at the time, I understood where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it \nSo \nUh, \nI don't think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order \nAnd I don't know \nI just think that they didn't \nThere was no unity \nThey didn't know what they were going into \nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that's what we created in turn in there \nUh, \nHonestly, I don't \nI don't think we're the ones to change those people \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that \nAnd uh, \nI don't \nI really don't have anything else to say \nIt's gone on for too long \nUh, \nI don't think we're making enough progress \nWe've made some progress, but not enough to stay there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there \nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse \nAnd we can't stay over there forever \nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nWell"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think people's sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think gay people shouldn't be blamed for their sexual orientation. I think it's unfair. Because they don't choose their sexual orientation. I think sexual orientation isn't an option. People can't choose whether they're gay or straight. I'm straight, another person is gay, that's how they're born. I think it's not a conscious choice. So I think they shouldn't be blamed. I think the government shouldn't interfere with this issue because it's not a legal issue. It's not a moral issue either. I don't think it's a national security issue. The government shouldn't interfere with personal matters. Everyone should have the right to choose their own life. Gay people should be treated with dignity and respect.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's completely different. Gay marriage has many aspects, and it can't be compared to heterosexual marriage. It's like two sides of the same coin - it will never be the other side. However, it's still the same thing. Gay couples have a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where their partner can't be in the room with them if they're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and gay couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people, like Catholics, can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that kind of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners, and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples, and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new, and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers, and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view, and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so, they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion, and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical, to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the morality of others is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under god in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects, instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making the drug available to the public, I would say no. Absolutely not. However, for medical purposes, I would say yes. Because, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It doesn't have benefits, you know what I mean. \n\nYes, I mean that there are many drugs that are illegal that are used in pharmacies. Like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet – those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, that's just not right. You should accept its benefits, I think. \n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if abused, can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol, it can also lead to bad things. It's a tough call. I'd say not. You could integrate it gradually, like make it legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused but if you just had to remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. \n\nUh, yes, I mean people have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we got rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes. No",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was every weekend I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there. And we would just go. But now as I've gotten older, they've made the mass for teenagers. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. You'd see the families running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also, when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. I don't know what kind of minister or reverend he is, but they allow them to get married. So I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, which part? About... [Um] Just the changing ways. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about the pedophilia. [Mm hmm.] Um, I think, like, the whole... [Um] Sexuality is before about being genetic. I think it's genetic. I don't think people just become that way. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] Um, no.",
            "I was initially okay with the premise of the Iraq war, but I think that the repercussions of the 9/11 attacks were still very much lingering, and we went to war in Iraq under a pretext, with many indications that we had already been moving towards Iraq. I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government. And I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I want to say something.\nMmhmm\nJust say anything?\nOkay\nOkay, that's cool\nUmum\nI'm sorry\nOkay\nLet's talk about how I feel about the Iraq War.\nLet me think\nAt this point, I think it's pointless because it wasn't even declared a war.\nI think it's just to get back at Iraq because we think they did the 9/11 attack.\nSo I don't think it's a reason for anything.\nI mean, I'm not a big person on the War in Iraq.\nSo I don't really keep up with it.\nI don't know the details of it.\nBut I do know that we're staying there to try to build a democracy, so it can become like another U.S. thing.\nAnd also to get oil and resources from them.\nBut that's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone mad.\nSo if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try to build a democracy, which takes forever because you can't build a democracy in just a day.\nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.\nUm let me think\nThis is a really hard topic\nThis is one topic I don't know anything about\nUm Iraq War\nOh this is hard\nUh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay thanks\nUm Well actually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think\nYou know\nThe only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it was never declared a war by Congress\nI think that's how it works\nYou have to declare a war by Congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOkay",
            "Uh\nI really don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. \nI believe it's entirely up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that it's right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "The Iraq War\nOkay\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nStarting from the beginning, I think the US government did not completely honestly tell the American people the reasons for invading Iraq\nBefore invading Iraq, I thought\nI thought they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks\nHowever, they were not really related to each other\nBut the government made it seem that way, and utilized the outrage of the American people over the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq, which started in 2003\nOkay\nI\nI myself and pretty much everyone else are against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against it\nOkay\nI think the Iraq War is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War\nThe US government should learn from past mistakes\nI think\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died\n\nThis is horrible\nWhat they were\nWhat they were doing was\nThey were removing the country's government\nI really don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur\nOkay\nAnd the US government\nAnd the US government removed the Iraqi government\nThey are trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq\nThis is similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd to implement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nBecause\nBecause\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country\nSpecific citizens in the country\nSo\nSo I think\nI think the government\nSo I think the government\nIf you're going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government\nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there's still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that\nThat the US government wasn't prepared, in a way, tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a\nA short, successful invasion of Iraq\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda\nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was a lot of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nThat's\nNo that's\nNo that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started and\nAnd so I mean once you're in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them\nAbandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we get our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference and uh, and it's been proven more and more now that it could be biological, as opposed to sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control. Um, because they can't control it. I think it's inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any reason for politics and government to have any part in this. It's not even on a state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. You know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way any other family would, you know, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that, uh, Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way that he wants to, I think it's ridiculous.\n\nCertainly, yes, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different, uh, publications and TV reports or newspapers, whatever, on that, it's something now that's been proven to be a chemical thing in your brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual. As opposed to, uh, growing up and you know, maybe with like four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side, opposed to sociological.\n\nUm, well, other than that, I guess the obvious reason is that, uh, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person just go to, uh, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of, uh, the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, uh, sector-type thing, opposed to, uh, public domain and, uh, national, uh, federal domain.\n\nUh, no, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, that's a different story altogether. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and partying and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I'd have to take action. That's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Not really.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nBut I think we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. \nNow we might just be doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think maybe the original motive was already questionable, related to George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo I think \nIf the original motivation was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a fair motivation if there weren't any personal interests involved. I don't think it would be fair if there were personal interests. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months of the war; that was a statement in itself. \nBut the fact that it's been going on for over a year or several years, I think it's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I think \nI mean, if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think \nI think our reason has become distorted and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYeah, I do think it's been going on long enough, and it should stop. \nI mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. \nAnd I think that time has come. \nWe've been spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems at home, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously other things we need to fund, such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads, anything dealing with schools, healthcare. \nWe certainly have a lot of problems to fund those things, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money's being spent to kill some of our own citizens in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",

I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't want to join the bandwagon of people who are like, 'I was against it from the beginning.' Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore. Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean, no, like 75 to 80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. 80% of Iraqis, um, 70% of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should withdraw within the year. Um, I don't know. It's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster. And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy. I don't think anyone's arguing that he's not. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll I mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

            "I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender. I don't know, I guess that's another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because their many things are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I think this is one of the most complicated issues we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are very delicate issues. And it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone. So, I don't know what I'm thinking. I think all civil unions are... I don't know if marriage should be looked at as defined by the government because it's considered a sacrament, so people get tax breaks or looked at in a certain way by the government if they were baptized. And if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is - two people. They shouldn't have the separation of church and state, and they shouldn't care about what kind of marriage it was - two people got united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people who got a civil union. Um, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's something that the constitution shouldn't be amended for just because it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage, simply put. Uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be decided by each state rather than the president. Many states are democratic and many are republican. Obviously, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you naturally know how that state feels about that issue. And if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you have the right to disagree with that decision because you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that. But I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in about two years. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should be up to each state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "Um, I don't completely agree. I think it's like this. Let's see. I'm trying to figure it out. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know it's basically for the public or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I feel like school officials seeing that, they have every right to see it. Because even if they weren't posting it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system. I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on the internet like on MySpace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel like, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, um, alright, well, um, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing a lot longer. But, um, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email, because I'm afraid someone will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and um, you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\nUm, like I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and um, they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lockdowns, and stuff, and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drills and stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because um, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Well \nUh, \nThe war \nUh, \nAt first, I supported the invasion because I was personally affected by 9/11 \nUh, \nI thought we should do the same thing here, create as much chaos as they did here \nUh, \nI think because 9/11 was an emotional thing, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences \nWe went there unprepared, no plan, \nUh, \nI think it backfired on us \nUh, \nI don't know \nI was all for it then, but now I'm completely against it \nI don't think it achieved anything \nUh, \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us \nLike, I don't think our being there will make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves \nSo uh, \nBecause of 9/11, I'm almost apathetic about what's going on over there \nUh, \nWith those people, I just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think they're human \nI don't know \nThey're just fighting with each other and can't do anything \nUh, \nI really don't care \nUh, \nI don't know \nWe went over there completely unprepared, without any idea of what we'd face \nUh, \nIt's also bad because war is very different for them than it is for us \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're trying to improve their country \nI just think they want us to leave \nAnd I think that's fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that's it \nUh, \nI think we were just hyped up, not thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nUh, \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd uh, \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUh, \nBut at the time, I understood where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it \nSo \nUh, \nI don't think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order \nAnd I don't know \nI just think that they didn't \nThere was no unity \nThey didn't know what they were going into \nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that's what we created in turn in there \nUh, \nHonestly, I don't \nI don't think we're the ones to change those people \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that \nAnd uh, \nI don't \nI really don't have anything else to say \nIt's gone on for too long \nUh, \nI don't think we're making enough progress \nWe've made some progress, but not enough to stay there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there \nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse \nAnd we can't stay over there forever \nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nWell"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change its views. They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else.",
            "I personally think that supporting same-sex marriage isn't a problem. I have some thoughts, I think they shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation as if it's a conscious decision. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. Although I haven't put a lot of thought into the topic, I still think it's wrong to say that. It seems like it's not a choice, but their nature. Like me being straight, another person being gay, it's not a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. The government shouldn't intervene because it's not a legal issue, it's not a moral issue. Gay people shouldn't be seen as making a wrong decision because of their sexual orientation. The government actually has no right to interfere. This is tough. I don't think the government should intervene because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral issues or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to intervene in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. The, who, you know, gay people. That's just how they're born or at least that's what I think and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized.\n\nBecause basically there's no good reason to oppose it.\n\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\n\nBut it's very different. There are many different aspects to it, and it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing. Where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family.\n\nAnd I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use like oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances but we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana then there's no point in doing that for me you should embrace its beneficial properties I think",
            "I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.",
            "Laughing \nWell, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I think we invaded Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us to Iraq. I think the early Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which have since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nWell, it just seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people openly and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least 9/11. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nThe last part, I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of his office. But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um, I can't remember the name of the Prime Minister, but he really has no control over the political process or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUh (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did a few things, just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",
            "I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the church because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear. It's clearly written in the constitution that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written. So, in terms of the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they're really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see most of the Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution, and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think it's right at all, in that aspect. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't know why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything. It could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Well the war in Iraq. OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that. Um And I think that it's the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with. I mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don't think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um and here and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam they were trying to push out Communists and implement and uphold democracy and it's and it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear I mean it was more of a it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because Um because because there because there are there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army you're fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country and so I think I think that the government so first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war cause I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be you need to plan for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still Um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so the war in Iraq well that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why isn't it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "When you put something on the internet, it's like an open forum.  It's totally public.  You can't control it.  I mean, as an RA, I've actually had to deal with this.  Uh, when you put something out there, it affects people's opinions of you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna say something.  You can't put that out there.  It's going to be seen by everybody.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin.  Someone went to the school and they have to act on that.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that.  I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school.  It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class.  I think that word I couldn't remember for a minute, uh.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI believe the initial intention was good. \nHowever, I think we've lost sight of that intention a long time ago. \nWe're just maybe doing it to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI just think the initial motives were questionable, related to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the original intention was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, I think that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal issues involved, I don't think it would be fair. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nHowever, I don't think our reasons have been deteriorated and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, and we don't want to end this thing without a decisive victory or conclusion. \nI think it's gone on long enough, and it should stop. \nTheir government and officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. \nI think that time has come. \nWe've been draining our economy for a long time, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be addressing. \nI think it's a heavy burden on our economy, as the purpose has been stretched to absurdity. \nThey're spending billions and billions of dollars. \nWar shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously issues like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, etc. \nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as healthcare, which I think could be better spent on. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the reason for.",
            "I'd like to clarify one thing, but I'm not sure if it's relevant. It's just that someone was online and they found out some stuff. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but on sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's basically public. And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think it's actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have someone just sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. But then it becomes some kind of discrimination if they're only looking at the bad kids. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it all depends on the situation - maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to see it, or maybe they were actually looking for evidence of something. So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online. He went onto someone's profile and got their screen name right away, and then talked to them on instant messenger and got them to meet him in under a minute. I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nUh, yeah, I've heard that my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was an issue about students being banned from having Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me, and I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace. I'm not even sure if that's a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to do that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I have.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",
            "We feel that there's still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States. I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender. For example, if you're from a rural area and your grammar isn't great, but you're extremely intelligent, and you work your way up to be a CEO, other men might look down on you and think, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put together a sentence?\" Or if you're intelligent but your grammar isn't great, other men might look down on you. So, our society might discriminate against you because of your gender and where you're from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't abolish it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, um, I mean for a variety of reasons. But there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because many of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "This problem I still haven't made up my mind on. So I can't say right or wrong on either side. But I think this is the most complex issue we're dealing with today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a headache. Because any definition will make some people unhappy. So I don't know, I think all civil unions don't necessarily have to be defined as marriage by the government. And since it's a religious ceremony, if you get married, you'll get tax breaks, or the government will consider you a special type. So if you get married, I think the government should just consider it a civil union because that's what it is, it's just two people. They shouldn't separate church and state, they shouldn't consider what kind of marriage it is, two people are combined. And also, same-sex marriage, I mean, it's just a civil union. Um, if all the states can reach a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just ridiculous. Because the constitution shouldn't be amended for some minor matters. I mean, it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban same-sex marriage, to put it simply. Uh, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family, so homosexuality is a gray area for me. \nBecause I have many gay friends, I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. \nI don't think it should be a national issue. \nHowever, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president.\n\nA lot of states are democratic and a lot of states are republican. \nObviously, democratic states will be in favor of gay marriage. \nIf you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. \nI don't think you should disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage, as you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI actually already answered that. \nI don't think Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \nI think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. \nI don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. \nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. \nPlus, he'll be out of office in about two years. \nIf a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. \nIt should just be up to each individual state, because they're the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo I don't.",
            "No, I don’t agree at all. \nLet me think about it. \nI think, Myspace is a public thing. \nAnd, bulletin board. \nYou know. \nIf you look at that definition, then you know, that basically it’s to post for the public to see or for others to see. \nNo matter what you’re trying to get at. \nAnd now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. \nIn my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it. \nBecause, even if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. \nBut uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that’s perfectly fine. \nLet me see here, like, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. \nBut, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don’t think that’s an invasion at all. \nShould I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, uh, it’s a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you’re writing. \nAlright, well, uh, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. \nEverything, like I’m worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. \nLike, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don’t, it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing, and I don’t know, let’s see here. \n\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them, or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they’re dropping them off at a safe place, I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, uh, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, uh, in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was incase people would come into the building I guess, uh, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, uh, in order to make the school a safer place, and that’s just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, uh, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, uh, yeah that’s basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that’s about it",
            "Okay, well, the war, um, at first I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run. \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. \nI really think that it backfired on us. \nI don’t know, I was all for it, but now I’m very against it. \nI don’t think it did anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re unable to get along with themselves. \nUnfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. \nWith those people, I just don’t care. \nI just think they’re not human. \nI don’t know, like they fight with each other and they can’t do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don’t care. \nI don’t know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. \nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there. \nIt’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there. \nAnd I think that should be fine for us. \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it. \nWe just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything. \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, also their whole culture. \nI just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. \nAnd, um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it. \nSo, I don’t think we could have let it go. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do in terms of I guess like creating order and, um, stability. \nAnd I don’t know, I just think that they didn’t have, there was no unity. \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for. \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn in there. \nHonestly, I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they’re always going to be like that. \nAnd, um, I don’t, I really don’t have anything else to say. \nIt’s gone on long enough. \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. \nWe’ve made progress, but not enough to stay in there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever. \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change its views. They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else.",
            "I personally think that supporting same-sex marriage isn't a problem. I have some thoughts, I think they shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation as if it's a conscious decision. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. Although I haven't put a lot of thought into the topic, I still think it's wrong to say that. It seems like it's not a choice, but their nature. Like me being straight, another person being gay, it's not a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. The government shouldn't intervene because it's not a legal issue, it's not a moral issue. Gay people shouldn't be seen as making a wrong decision because of their sexual orientation. The government actually has no right to interfere. This is tough. I don't think the government should intervene because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral issues or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to intervene in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. The, who, you know, gay people. That's just how they're born or at least that's what I think and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized.\n\nBecause basically there's no good reason to oppose it.\n\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\n\nBut it's very different. There are many different aspects to it, and it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing. Where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family.\n\nAnd I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use like oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances but we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana then there's no point in doing that for me you should embrace its beneficial properties I think",
            "I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.",
            "Laughing \nWell, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I think we invaded Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us to Iraq. I think the early Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which have since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nWell, it just seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people openly and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least 9/11. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nThe last part, I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of his office. But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um, I can't remember the name of the Prime Minister, but he really has no control over the political process or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUh (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did a few things, just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",
            "I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the church because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear. It's clearly written in the constitution that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written. So, in terms of the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they're really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see most of the Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution, and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think it's right at all, in that aspect. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't know why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything. It could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Well the war in Iraq. OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that. Um And I think that it's the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with. I mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don't think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um and here and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam they were trying to push out Communists and implement and uphold democracy and it's and it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear I mean it was more of a it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because Um because because there because there are there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army you're fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country and so I think I think that the government so first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war cause I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be you need to plan for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still Um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so the war in Iraq well that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why isn't it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "When you put something on the internet, it's like an open forum.  It's totally public.  You can't control it.  I mean, as an RA, I've actually had to deal with this.  Uh, when you put something out there, it affects people's opinions of you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna say something.  You can't put that out there.  It's going to be seen by everybody.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin.  Someone went to the school and they have to act on that.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that.  I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school.  It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class.  I think that word I couldn't remember for a minute, uh.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI believe the initial intention was good. \nHowever, I think we've lost sight of that intention a long time ago. \nWe're just maybe doing it to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI just think the initial motives were questionable, related to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the original intention was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, I think that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal issues involved, I don't think it would be fair. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nHowever, I don't think our reasons have been deteriorated and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, and we don't want to end this thing without a decisive victory or conclusion. \nI think it's gone on long enough, and it should stop. \nTheir government and officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. \nI think that time has come. \nWe've been draining our economy for a long time, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be addressing. \nI think it's a heavy burden on our economy, as the purpose has been stretched to absurdity. \nThey're spending billions and billions of dollars. \nWar shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously issues like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, etc. \nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as healthcare, which I think could be better spent on. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the reason for.",
            "I'd like to clarify one thing, but I'm not sure if it's relevant. It's just that someone was online and they found out some stuff. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but on sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's basically public. And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think it's actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have someone just sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. But then it becomes some kind of discrimination if they're only looking at the bad kids. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it all depends on the situation - maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to see it, or maybe they were actually looking for evidence of something. So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online. He went onto someone's profile and got their screen name right away, and then talked to them on instant messenger and got them to meet him in under a minute. I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nUh, yeah, I've heard that my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was an issue about students being banned from having Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me, and I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace. I'm not even sure if that's a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to do that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I have.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",
            "We feel that there's still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States. I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender. For example, if you're from a rural area and your grammar isn't great, but you're extremely intelligent, and you work your way up to be a CEO, other men might look down on you and think, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put together a sentence?\" Or if you're intelligent but your grammar isn't great, other men might look down on you. So, our society might discriminate against you because of your gender and where you're from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't abolish it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, um, I mean for a variety of reasons. But there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because many of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "This problem I still haven't made up my mind on. So I can't say right or wrong on either side. But I think this is the most complex issue we're dealing with today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a headache. Because any definition will make some people unhappy. So I don't know, I think all civil unions don't necessarily have to be defined as marriage by the government. And since it's a religious ceremony, if you get married, you'll get tax breaks, or the government will consider you a special type. So if you get married, I think the government should just consider it a civil union because that's what it is, it's just two people. They shouldn't separate church and state, they shouldn't consider what kind of marriage it is, two people are combined. And also, same-sex marriage, I mean, it's just a civil union. Um, if all the states can reach a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just ridiculous. Because the constitution shouldn't be amended for some minor matters. I mean, it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban same-sex marriage, to put it simply. Uh, no.",

            "Okay, well, the war, um, at first I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run. \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. \nI really think that it backfired on us. \nI don’t know, I was all for it, but now I’m very against it. \nI don’t think it did anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re unable to get along with themselves. \nUnfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. \nWith those people, I just don’t care. \nI just think they’re not human. \nI don’t know, like they fight with each other and they can’t do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don’t care. \nI don’t know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. \nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there. \nIt’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there. \nAnd I think that should be fine for us. \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it. \nWe just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything. \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, also their whole culture. \nI just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. \nAnd, um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it. \nSo, I don’t think we could have let it go. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do in terms of I guess like creating order and, um, stability. \nAnd I don’t know, I just think that they didn’t have, there was no unity. \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for. \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn in there. \nHonestly, I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they’re always going to be like that. \nAnd, um, I don’t, I really don’t have anything else to say. \nIt’s gone on long enough. \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. \nWe’ve made progress, but not enough to stay in there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever. \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change its views. They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else.",
            "I personally think that supporting same-sex marriage isn't a problem. I have some thoughts, I think they shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation as if it's a conscious decision. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. Although I haven't put a lot of thought into the topic, I still think it's wrong to say that. It seems like it's not a choice, but their nature. Like me being straight, another person being gay, it's not a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. The government shouldn't intervene because it's not a legal issue, it's not a moral issue. Gay people shouldn't be seen as making a wrong decision because of their sexual orientation. The government actually has no right to interfere. This is tough. I don't think the government should intervene because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral issues or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to intervene in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. The, who, you know, gay people. That's just how they're born or at least that's what I think and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized.\n\nBecause basically there's no good reason to oppose it.\n\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\n\nBut it's very different. There are many different aspects to it, and it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing. Where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family.\n\nAnd I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use like oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances but we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana then there's no point in doing that for me you should embrace its beneficial properties I think",
            "I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.",
            "Laughing \nWell, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I think we invaded Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us to Iraq. I think the early Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which have since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nWell, it just seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people openly and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least 9/11. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nThe last part, I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of his office. But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um, I can't remember the name of the Prime Minister, but he really has no control over the political process or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUh (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did a few things, just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",
            "I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the church because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear. It's clearly written in the constitution that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written. So, in terms of the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they're really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see most of the Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution, and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think it's right at all, in that aspect. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't know why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything. It could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Well the war in Iraq. OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that. Um And I think that it's the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with. I mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don't think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um and here and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam they were trying to push out Communists and implement and uphold democracy and it's and it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear I mean it was more of a it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because Um because because there because there are there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army you're fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country and so I think I think that the government so first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war cause I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be you need to plan for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still Um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so the war in Iraq well that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why isn't it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "When you put something on the internet, it's like an open forum.  It's totally public.  You can't control it.  I mean, as an RA, I've actually had to deal with this.  Uh, when you put something out there, it affects people's opinions of you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna say something.  You can't put that out there.  It's going to be seen by everybody.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin.  Someone went to the school and they have to act on that.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that.  I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school.  It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class.  I think that word I couldn't remember for a minute, uh.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI believe the initial intention was good. \nHowever, I think we've lost sight of that intention a long time ago. \nWe're just maybe doing it to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI just think the initial motives were questionable, related to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the original intention was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, I think that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal issues involved, I don't think it would be fair. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nHowever, I don't think our reasons have been deteriorated and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, and we don't want to end this thing without a decisive victory or conclusion. \nI think it's gone on long enough, and it should stop. \nTheir government and officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. \nI think that time has come. \nWe've been draining our economy for a long time, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be addressing. \nI think it's a heavy burden on our economy, as the purpose has been stretched to absurdity. \nThey're spending billions and billions of dollars. \nWar shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously issues like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, etc. \nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as healthcare, which I think could be better spent on. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the reason for.",
            "I'd like to clarify one thing, but I'm not sure if it's relevant. It's just that someone was online and they found out some stuff. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but on sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's basically public. And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think it's actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have someone just sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. But then it becomes some kind of discrimination if they're only looking at the bad kids. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it all depends on the situation - maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to see it, or maybe they were actually looking for evidence of something. So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online. He went onto someone's profile and got their screen name right away, and then talked to them on instant messenger and got them to meet him in under a minute. I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nUh, yeah, I've heard that my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was an issue about students being banned from having Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me, and I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace. I'm not even sure if that's a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to do that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I have.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",
            "We feel that there's still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States. I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender. For example, if you're from a rural area and your grammar isn't great, but you're extremely intelligent, and you work your way up to be a CEO, other men might look down on you and think, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put together a sentence?\" Or if you're intelligent but your grammar isn't great, other men might look down on you. So, our society might discriminate against you because of your gender and where you're from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't abolish it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, um, I mean for a variety of reasons. But there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because many of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "This problem I still haven't made up my mind on. So I can't say right or wrong on either side. But I think this is the most complex issue we're dealing with today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a headache. Because any definition will make some people unhappy. So I don't know, I think all civil unions don't necessarily have to be defined as marriage by the government. And since it's a religious ceremony, if you get married, you'll get tax breaks, or the government will consider you a special type. So if you get married, I think the government should just consider it a civil union because that's what it is, it's just two people. They shouldn't separate church and state, they shouldn't consider what kind of marriage it is, two people are combined. And also, same-sex marriage, I mean, it's just a civil union. Um, if all the states can reach a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just ridiculous. Because the constitution shouldn't be amended for some minor matters. I mean, it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban same-sex marriage, to put it simply. Uh, no.",

            "Okay, well, the war, um, at first I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run. \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. \nI really think that it backfired on us. \nI don’t know, I was all for it, but now I’m very against it. \nI don’t think it did anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re unable to get along with themselves. \nUnfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. \nWith those people, I just don’t care. \nI just think they’re not human. \nI don’t know, like they fight with each other and they can’t do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don’t care. \nI don’t know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. \nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there. \nIt’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there. \nAnd I think that should be fine for us. \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it. \nWe just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything. \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, also their whole culture. \nI just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. \nAnd, um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it. \nSo, I don’t think we could have let it go. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do in terms of I guess like creating order and, um, stability. \nAnd I don’t know, I just think that they didn’t have, there was no unity. \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for. \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn in there. \nHonestly, I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they’re always going to be like that. \nAnd, um, I don’t, I really don’t have anything else to say. \nIt’s gone on long enough. \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. \nWe’ve made progress, but not enough to stay in there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever. \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are a bit outdated. The Catholic Church has been talking about how they are losing some of their followers. I think this is because the Catholic Church is not very open to many things. For example, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - they have very strong views on them. Their views on these things might be reasonable, but some are outdated. If they could adapt to some more modern ways of thinking, they wouldn't be afraid of losing followers.\n\nMany people are starting to feel disenchanted with the Catholic Church because of their views on these things. Some people are starting to disagree with them on these issues. So, I think the Catholic Church's views are probably wrong. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not want to join a church that teaches it's completely wrong and you're going against it.\n\nSimilarly, if you support gay marriage, you might not want to join a church that doesn't agree with that. The Catholic Church doesn't allow women to be priests, so if you support that change, you might not want to join a church that opposes women priests.\n\nI don't think there's any reason why priests can't get married or women can't be priests. They say priests are already married to God and have completely dedicated their lives to God. But almost everyone has their job and family life, and they care about other things. So, I don't think priests can't have both their work and family life.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage personally, I think it's unfair to blame gay people for their sexual orientation. It seems like it's not a choice, it's just the way they were born. I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious decision. It's not right for the government to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral issue, it's just a personal choice. It's not their place to intervene in people's lives. Being gay is just who they are, and that's not something to be punished for.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are many different aspects to it that it can never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that come along with it such as property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick. And can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples do. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing\" but in a legal sense if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the kids aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beat up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the kid removed from their school and it's just a kid I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. Alright, I mean, if it has benefits, then it's okay for medical purposes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. It's not that beneficial. You know what I mean. Yeah, alright, I mean there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like aspirin, amoxicillin, and codeine, and those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have benefits, and if you deny those benefits, it's like because there's a taboo around marijuana, A, there's no point in doing that for me. I think you should embrace its benefits. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, it can lead to bad things. Alright, it's a tough one, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, alright, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but I mean it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Alright, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. No.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every time I went to church. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nDuring the summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in terms of that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it. \n[Okay, um, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests concerning pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to get married?] \nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are men who are married and they still become pedophiles and they still have an attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they become a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, there are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be. \nLike on Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of religion it is, he's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm.] \nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[Okay can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] \nUm, on which part? \nAbout... \n[Um.] \nJust the changing ways. \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia. \n[Mm hmm.] \nUm, I think, like the whole... \nUm, the issue of sex before being a pedophile. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people just become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut I think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through marriage. \nYou could try, but it would usually come out. \nSo I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm, if they knew about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut I don't think in all cases they knew. \n[Okay do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm, no.",
            "(laughs) \nUm, initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks and that we sort of went into Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false. And that's very much rubbed me the wrong way and generally the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. \n\nUm, it just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, at least since September 11th. I mean, they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. But it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems, because, um, Iraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um, oh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process, or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUm, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I started to wonder if I should just talk about something.  Okay, cool.  Uh-huh.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Okay.  How do I feel about the Iraq War?  Let me think.  Uh.  At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually.  And I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. like who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven.  So I don't feel like I'm very involved in the War in Iraq.  So I don't really keep up with it.  I don't know the big details of it.  But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. But it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset.  So and then like if we stay over there, then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day.  And then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.  Uh.  Let me think.  Ohh this is so hard.  This is the one topic I don't know anything about.  Uh.  War in Iraq. Oh this is hard.  Uh.  Mmm.  Uhh I don't know.  Do you have anything else I can go off of?  Okay.  Thank you.  Um.  Well, um.  Actually, I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair.  I don't think we should call it a war anymore.  But because I don't think that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that you know that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns.  But I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it.  It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress.  I think that's how the whole thing works.  You have to declare a war by congress and then it's.  I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try.  Actually no.  I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them.  But it's also like wasting our resources.  And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever because he started this meaningless war and stuff so huh you have to make this a half an hour don't you uh okay yeah um huh I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",

            "The war in Iraq\n\nOkay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nI don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think they\nI think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they didn't have much to do with each other\nHowever, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUh\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war so\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that\nUh\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\n\nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the country's government and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur\nUh\nAnd the government and the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out the Communists and implement and uphold democracy\nAnd it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear loss in Vietnam because\nBecause there were there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and the specific citizens in the country and so I think the government should have been more prepared for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean it's not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't have been so naive because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful\n\nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and uh so so let's see the war in Iraq\n\nWell that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see uh I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "I won't say it, but as an RA, I've had to deal with this before. When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum, completely public. You can't. I mean, I was saying that as an RA, I've already dealt with it. You put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right] So you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just fooling around. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I don't know, I forgot the word. And it could also be something very serious. I think. Well, what happened here was that something happened, and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, and then they called it in. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook, and they were worried because there were some things on there that they might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs, but if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. I mean, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that, and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. That's not really it.",
            "I think this war has been prolonged for too long. The initial purpose was good, to restore democracy in another country. But now I think we have lost sight of that initial purpose. We may be doing it just to prove that we are a superpower in the world, just to prove ourselves. Perhaps the motives were questionable due to the problems with Saddam Hussein at the time.\n\nIf the initial purpose was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation. But if there were personal vendettas involved, that wouldn't be fair.\n\nI think we conveyed our purpose when we first started the war, and that in itself was a statement. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to save a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a justifiable reason for the war. But I think our reason has been distorted over time. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of war. We don't just want to end the war, we want to win.\n\nI think this war has gone on for too long. Their government officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. I think that time has come.

War shouldn't be a long-term expense.\n\nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as poverty, education, highway construction, schools, and healthcare.

            "I mean, we only have this and then one more time I get to talk about the Iraq War. I mean, I feel embarrassed saying this, but I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the beginning. I was, but it's not really important anymore because everyone in the world thinks it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, just look at the recent polls. They've done United States polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of troops stationed there. It's like the US troops stationed there now think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within a year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big of a gap for this administration, or any administration, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, no one's arguing that. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went in. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay in there, and the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to gradually pull out over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read a statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now. And like these are the people we're trying to save, we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely falls apart, we could say, \"We wanted to stay in, but you guys made the decision to leave.\" Then, you know, at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States, especially in certain specific fields of work.  Although it's not just women who face these problems, I think women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even if society promotes equality, a lot of people have a hard time accepting a woman in a leadership position.  The values that have been cultivated in society for a long time make it difficult for people to accept women in leadership positions in the workplace.  Sometimes women will see a job that is suitable for them and have the necessary qualifications, but are refused promotion to a higher position because of historical reasons.  The same thing happens to men, especially in the fashion industry and as stay-at-home dads.  Society tends to expect men to be the main breadwinners of the family and looks down on them when they decide to be stay-at-home dads, because they think they should be working.  This makes it difficult for men because their dream is to be with their kids and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job and it works out fine for them.  However, society looks down on them for their choice.  Also, men in the fashion industry may not be taken seriously because they are men.  Typically, men who are into fashion have different lifestyles, so if you have a typical lifestyle as a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?  You don't really know what our case is like.  Like those other guys.\"  Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.  To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've made great progress from the 1800s, but change is slow.  So I feel that if we continue working at our current pace because women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job, or she wants to be the one who works.\"  And, um, then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their female friends or their wives, and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from.  So I guess you kinda have to, in a way, promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them.  Because if you force it, people will resist.  And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.  So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time.  Yes.  Um.  Well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.  Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent, and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down on you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"  So, yeah.  So, like, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender.  And I don't know.  I guess that'd be another example.  Um, not really.",
            "Well, I think they didn’t fully legalize it. \nThey decriminalized it. \nUm, which knocked it down from a crime to more like a traffic ticket. \nYou know, something you just get fined for, rather than having to be booked and arrested and brought in, and all that. \nAnd I think if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, \nUm, those types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be there. \nBut at the same time, there's an argument that, um, it costs a lot to arrest people and bring them in and book them, \nand to house them and then let them go, \nand then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, \nand then appoint a public defender, \nand then you have to pay the judge, and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. \nAnd um, I mean so, \nWhen you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for them, \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. \nBut in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, \nI have to use the word liberal, \nBut you know what I mean, \nKind of, uh, \nKind of open-minded. \nThen I think it's totally fine. \nAnd I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, \nthat they can spend on social programs for the elderly, \nand that they can spend on \nYou know, food programs for homeless people. \nUm, I mean so, \nI think it's \nIt's important, I mean, marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, \nAll over the streets and stuff, \nUm, I mean for a variety of reasons, \nBut there's this whole like financial element to it as well, \nOther reasons like, \nWhy it shouldn't be fully \nWell no, \nI mean I \nI don't know how I would feel about \nWell, if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes, where it could be sold in gas stations, and people would be smoking it everywhere. \nThen I mean, \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, \nAnd um, \nIt still is like taboo in our society, \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts, \nUh, \nTo smoke marijuana. \nSo, \nTo have it out in the open like that, \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. \nUm, \nAnd, \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low. \nUm, \nI don’t really know. \nUm, \nI think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. \nUm, \nBut I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyles, \nAs opposed to just their decision-making, motor skills. \nI mean, \nBut they, \nThey both have their adverse effects, \nAnd I mean, they, \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general, \nLike no two people really react the same way. \nI mean, and then people, \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal, and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. \nSo, \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, \nWhen people react differently. \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. \nUm, yeah, \nUh, \nNo, I don’t.",

            "I still haven't made up my mind on this matter. I haven't decided which side is correct. But I think this is the most complicated issue we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a very complicated issue. If we can't avoid hurting anyone, I don't know. I think all civil unions. I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. Because it's considered a sacrament, people shouldn't get tax breaks or be looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized. So if you're married, I think the government should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people. They shouldn't separate church and state. They shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. So, the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people got a civil union. Well, if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution just because some people think it's important. But it's not a big enough issue to be a constitutional amendment.

But I think it should be legalized. However, I think it shouldn't be a national issue, but should be decided by each state rather than like the president deciding for the entire country. In fact, many states are democratic and many states are republican. Democratic states will definitely support gay marriage, and republican states will definitely not. Therefore, if you live in a democratic state, you should respect the stance of that state because you chose it. So I think homosexuals should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, so it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. In fact, I've already answered that. However, I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. My idea is that only when a state decides should each state decide for itself. This is mainly because Bush won't be living in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should operate. Finally, I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, Bush will be out of office in about two years. If a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president.",
            "I think \nNo, I completely disagree. \nUh, let me think, I believe \nI think \nMyspace is a public platform \nAnd \nAlso, a bulletin board \nYou know \nIf you look at that definition \nUh, then \nYou know \nIt's basically for the public to see \nOr others to see \nUh, whatever you're trying to express \nAnd \nNow, if you post that on the internet \nUh, you know \nYou have to be aware that people will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nUh, so I think school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name \nThey could still access that through their homes \nUh \nBut \nYes, that's to prevent school shooting \nYou know \nAs long as it saves the lives of \nUh \nStudents \nWhich is the responsibility of the school system \nI think that \nUh \nThat's perfectly fine \nLet me see here \nFor example \nUh \nYou know \nIf they go on the internet, like on Myspace, just to see if \nYou know \nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there just specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nUh \nI think \nYou know \nAs long as they save \nYou know \nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nUh \nShould I elaborate more on that \n\nYes, uh \nAlright \nWell \nUh \nIt's a lot easier to \nUh \nExpress yourself \nUh \nA lot longer when you're writing \nBut \n\nAlright \nWell \nUh \nLike what I was saying \nIt is a public thing \nUh \nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace \nAnd \nNot expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nUh \nEverything \nLike I'm \nUh \nAfraid to post stuff like even through emails \nUh \nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will see it \nAnd \nYou know \nEverything nowadays comes back \nAnd \nYou know \nIt bites you in the butt I guess you could say \n\nUh \nLike \nYou know \nIf you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will find an email that you sent somehow \nAnd \nLike \nOnce it's on the internet it's always on the internet \nAnd \nUh \nYou know \nIf you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it \nYou will get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't \nIt wasn't an invasion of privacy at all \nBecause \nYou know \nLike I said before \nAnd \nWell that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing \nAnd \nUh \nI don't know \nLet's see here \n\nUh \nLike I had said before I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place \nUh \nThen I think that's perfectly fine for them \nOr \nUh \nOther officials such as the police to go on \nUh \nYou know \nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel like \nYou know \nThey're dropping them off at a safe place \nI've actually discussed this with a \nUh \nA \nUh \nTeacher of mine \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nUh \nThey said \nYou know \nWe have to ensure things like this \nBecause \nLike \nWe would do like lockdowns \nAnd \nOther things \nAnd \nUh \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nUh \nWe had to be careful about that \nWe had like drills \nAnd \nEven though that doesn't have anything to do with the \nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nUh \nThat was in case people would come into the building I guess \nUh \nSo we \nYou know \nWe did practice that stuff \nUh \nIn order to make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's just what the school officials were doing in this case \nThey were just making it a safer place \nUh \nPreventing anything bad from happening \nLike \nColumbine or something like that \nUh \nYeah that's basically all I can think of \n\nUh no that's about it",
            "At first, I was all for war because I was affected by nine eleven personally. I thought we should go over there and cause just as much chaos as they did here. But I think since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. I really think that it backfired on us. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're fighting with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I've almost just stopped caring about what goes on over there. I just don't care. I think sometimes I don't even think they're human. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't do anything themselves, so I really don't care. We definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different from war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there, and I think that's fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. I also think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. But at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.\" So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't have unity. They didn't know what they were going into for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And, honestly, I don't have anything else to say. Our discussion has definitely gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. We can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are a bit outdated. The Catholic Church has been talking about how they are losing some of their followers. I think this is because the Catholic Church is not very open to many things. For example, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - they have very strong views on them. Their views on these things might be reasonable, but some are outdated. If they could adapt to some more modern ways of thinking, they wouldn't be afraid of losing followers.\n\nMany people are starting to feel disenchanted with the Catholic Church because of their views on these things. Some people are starting to disagree with them on these issues. So, I think the Catholic Church's views are probably wrong. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not want to join a church that teaches it's completely wrong and you're going against it.\n\nSimilarly, if you support gay marriage, you might not want to join a church that doesn't agree with that. The Catholic Church doesn't allow women to be priests, so if you support that change, you might not want to join a church that opposes women priests.\n\nI don't think there's any reason why priests can't get married or women can't be priests. They say priests are already married to God and have completely dedicated their lives to God. But almost everyone has their job and family life, and they care about other things. So, I don't think priests can't have both their work and family life.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage personally, I think it's unfair to blame gay people for their sexual orientation. It seems like it's not a choice, it's just the way they were born. I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious decision. It's not right for the government to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral issue, it's just a personal choice. It's not their place to intervene in people's lives. Being gay is just who they are, and that's not something to be punished for.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are many different aspects to it that it can never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that come along with it such as property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick. And can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples do. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing\" but in a legal sense if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the kids aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beat up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the kid removed from their school and it's just a kid I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. Alright, I mean, if it has benefits, then it's okay for medical purposes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. It's not that beneficial. You know what I mean. Yeah, alright, I mean there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like aspirin, amoxicillin, and codeine, and those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have benefits, and if you deny those benefits, it's like because there's a taboo around marijuana, A, there's no point in doing that for me. I think you should embrace its benefits. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, it can lead to bad things. Alright, it's a tough one, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, alright, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but I mean it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Alright, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. No.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every time I went to church. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nDuring the summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in terms of that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it. \n[Okay, um, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests concerning pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to get married?] \nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are men who are married and they still become pedophiles and they still have an attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they become a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, there are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be. \nLike on Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of religion it is, he's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm.] \nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[Okay can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] \nUm, on which part? \nAbout... \n[Um.] \nJust the changing ways. \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia. \n[Mm hmm.] \nUm, I think, like the whole... \nUm, the issue of sex before being a pedophile. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people just become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut I think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through marriage. \nYou could try, but it would usually come out. \nSo I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm, if they knew about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut I don't think in all cases they knew. \n[Okay do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm, no.",
            "(laughs) \nUm, initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks and that we sort of went into Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false. And that's very much rubbed me the wrong way and generally the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. \n\nUm, it just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, at least since September 11th. I mean, they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. But it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems, because, um, Iraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um, oh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process, or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUm, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I started to wonder if I should just talk about something.  Okay, cool.  Uh-huh.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Okay.  How do I feel about the Iraq War?  Let me think.  Uh.  At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually.  And I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. like who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven.  So I don't feel like I'm very involved in the War in Iraq.  So I don't really keep up with it.  I don't know the big details of it.  But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. But it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset.  So and then like if we stay over there, then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day.  And then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.  Uh.  Let me think.  Ohh this is so hard.  This is the one topic I don't know anything about.  Uh.  War in Iraq. Oh this is hard.  Uh.  Mmm.  Uhh I don't know.  Do you have anything else I can go off of?  Okay.  Thank you.  Um.  Well, um.  Actually, I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair.  I don't think we should call it a war anymore.  But because I don't think that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that you know that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns.  But I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it.  It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress.  I think that's how the whole thing works.  You have to declare a war by congress and then it's.  I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try.  Actually no.  I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them.  But it's also like wasting our resources.  And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever because he started this meaningless war and stuff so huh you have to make this a half an hour don't you uh okay yeah um huh I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",

            "The war in Iraq\n\nOkay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nI don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think they\nI think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they didn't have much to do with each other\nHowever, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUh\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war so\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that\nUh\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\n\nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the country's government and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur\nUh\nAnd the government and the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out the Communists and implement and uphold democracy\nAnd it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear loss in Vietnam because\nBecause there were there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and the specific citizens in the country and so I think the government should have been more prepared for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean it's not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't have been so naive because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful\n\nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and uh so so let's see the war in Iraq\n\nWell that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see uh I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "I won't say it, but as an RA, I've had to deal with this before. When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum, completely public. You can't. I mean, I was saying that as an RA, I've already dealt with it. You put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right] So you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just fooling around. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I don't know, I forgot the word. And it could also be something very serious. I think. Well, what happened here was that something happened, and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, and then they called it in. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook, and they were worried because there were some things on there that they might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs, but if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. I mean, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that, and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. That's not really it.",
            "I think this war has been prolonged for too long. The initial purpose was good, to restore democracy in another country. But now I think we have lost sight of that initial purpose. We may be doing it just to prove that we are a superpower in the world, just to prove ourselves. Perhaps the motives were questionable due to the problems with Saddam Hussein at the time.\n\nIf the initial purpose was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation. But if there were personal vendettas involved, that wouldn't be fair.\n\nI think we conveyed our purpose when we first started the war, and that in itself was a statement. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to save a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a justifiable reason for the war. But I think our reason has been distorted over time. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of war. We don't just want to end the war, we want to win.\n\nI think this war has gone on for too long. Their government officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. I think that time has come.

War shouldn't be a long-term expense.\n\nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as poverty, education, highway construction, schools, and healthcare.

            "I mean, we only have this and then one more time I get to talk about the Iraq War. I mean, I feel embarrassed saying this, but I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the beginning. I was, but it's not really important anymore because everyone in the world thinks it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, just look at the recent polls. They've done United States polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of troops stationed there. It's like the US troops stationed there now think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within a year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big of a gap for this administration, or any administration, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, no one's arguing that. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went in. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay in there, and the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to gradually pull out over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read a statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now. And like these are the people we're trying to save, we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely falls apart, we could say, \"We wanted to stay in, but you guys made the decision to leave.\" Then, you know, at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States, especially in certain specific fields of work.  Although it's not just women who face these problems, I think women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even if society promotes equality, a lot of people have a hard time accepting a woman in a leadership position.  The values that have been cultivated in society for a long time make it difficult for people to accept women in leadership positions in the workplace.  Sometimes women will see a job that is suitable for them and have the necessary qualifications, but are refused promotion to a higher position because of historical reasons.  The same thing happens to men, especially in the fashion industry and as stay-at-home dads.  Society tends to expect men to be the main breadwinners of the family and looks down on them when they decide to be stay-at-home dads, because they think they should be working.  This makes it difficult for men because their dream is to be with their kids and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job and it works out fine for them.  However, society looks down on them for their choice.  Also, men in the fashion industry may not be taken seriously because they are men.  Typically, men who are into fashion have different lifestyles, so if you have a typical lifestyle as a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?  You don't really know what our case is like.  Like those other guys.\"  Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.  To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've made great progress from the 1800s, but change is slow.  So I feel that if we continue working at our current pace because women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job, or she wants to be the one who works.\"  And, um, then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their female friends or their wives, and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from.  So I guess you kinda have to, in a way, promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them.  Because if you force it, people will resist.  And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.  So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time.  Yes.  Um.  Well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.  Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent, and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down on you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"  So, yeah.  So, like, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender.  And I don't know.  I guess that'd be another example.  Um, not really.",
            "Well, I think they didn’t fully legalize it. \nThey decriminalized it. \nUm, which knocked it down from a crime to more like a traffic ticket. \nYou know, something you just get fined for, rather than having to be booked and arrested and brought in, and all that. \nAnd I think if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, \nUm, those types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be there. \nBut at the same time, there's an argument that, um, it costs a lot to arrest people and bring them in and book them, \nand to house them and then let them go, \nand then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, \nand then appoint a public defender, \nand then you have to pay the judge, and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. \nAnd um, I mean so, \nWhen you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for them, \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. \nBut in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, \nI have to use the word liberal, \nBut you know what I mean, \nKind of, uh, \nKind of open-minded. \nThen I think it's totally fine. \nAnd I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, \nthat they can spend on social programs for the elderly, \nand that they can spend on \nYou know, food programs for homeless people. \nUm, I mean so, \nI think it's \nIt's important, I mean, marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, \nAll over the streets and stuff, \nUm, I mean for a variety of reasons, \nBut there's this whole like financial element to it as well, \nOther reasons like, \nWhy it shouldn't be fully \nWell no, \nI mean I \nI don't know how I would feel about \nWell, if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes, where it could be sold in gas stations, and people would be smoking it everywhere. \nThen I mean, \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, \nAnd um, \nIt still is like taboo in our society, \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts, \nUh, \nTo smoke marijuana. \nSo, \nTo have it out in the open like that, \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. \nUm, \nAnd, \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low. \nUm, \nI don’t really know. \nUm, \nI think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. \nUm, \nBut I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyles, \nAs opposed to just their decision-making, motor skills. \nI mean, \nBut they, \nThey both have their adverse effects, \nAnd I mean, they, \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general, \nLike no two people really react the same way. \nI mean, and then people, \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal, and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. \nSo, \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, \nWhen people react differently. \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. \nUm, yeah, \nUh, \nNo, I don’t.",

            "I still haven't made up my mind on this matter. I haven't decided which side is correct. But I think this is the most complicated issue we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a very complicated issue. If we can't avoid hurting anyone, I don't know. I think all civil unions. I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. Because it's considered a sacrament, people shouldn't get tax breaks or be looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized. So if you're married, I think the government should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people. They shouldn't separate church and state. They shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. So, the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people got a civil union. Well, if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution just because some people think it's important. But it's not a big enough issue to be a constitutional amendment.

But I think it should be legalized. However, I think it shouldn't be a national issue, but should be decided by each state rather than like the president deciding for the entire country. In fact, many states are democratic and many states are republican. Democratic states will definitely support gay marriage, and republican states will definitely not. Therefore, if you live in a democratic state, you should respect the stance of that state because you chose it. So I think homosexuals should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, so it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. In fact, I've already answered that. However, I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. My idea is that only when a state decides should each state decide for itself. This is mainly because Bush won't be living in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should operate. Finally, I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, Bush will be out of office in about two years. If a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president.",
            "I think \nNo, I completely disagree. \nUh, let me think, I believe \nI think \nMyspace is a public platform \nAnd \nAlso, a bulletin board \nYou know \nIf you look at that definition \nUh, then \nYou know \nIt's basically for the public to see \nOr others to see \nUh, whatever you're trying to express \nAnd \nNow, if you post that on the internet \nUh, you know \nYou have to be aware that people will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nUh, so I think school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name \nThey could still access that through their homes \nUh \nBut \nYes, that's to prevent school shooting \nYou know \nAs long as it saves the lives of \nUh \nStudents \nWhich is the responsibility of the school system \nI think that \nUh \nThat's perfectly fine \nLet me see here \nFor example \nUh \nYou know \nIf they go on the internet, like on Myspace, just to see if \nYou know \nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there just specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nUh \nI think \nYou know \nAs long as they save \nYou know \nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nUh \nShould I elaborate more on that \n\nYes, uh \nAlright \nWell \nUh \nIt's a lot easier to \nUh \nExpress yourself \nUh \nA lot longer when you're writing \nBut \n\nAlright \nWell \nUh \nLike what I was saying \nIt is a public thing \nUh \nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace \nAnd \nNot expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nUh \nEverything \nLike I'm \nUh \nAfraid to post stuff like even through emails \nUh \nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will see it \nAnd \nYou know \nEverything nowadays comes back \nAnd \nYou know \nIt bites you in the butt I guess you could say \n\nUh \nLike \nYou know \nIf you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will find an email that you sent somehow \nAnd \nLike \nOnce it's on the internet it's always on the internet \nAnd \nUh \nYou know \nIf you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it \nYou will get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't \nIt wasn't an invasion of privacy at all \nBecause \nYou know \nLike I said before \nAnd \nWell that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing \nAnd \nUh \nI don't know \nLet's see here \n\nUh \nLike I had said before I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place \nUh \nThen I think that's perfectly fine for them \nOr \nUh \nOther officials such as the police to go on \nUh \nYou know \nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel like \nYou know \nThey're dropping them off at a safe place \nI've actually discussed this with a \nUh \nA \nUh \nTeacher of mine \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nUh \nThey said \nYou know \nWe have to ensure things like this \nBecause \nLike \nWe would do like lockdowns \nAnd \nOther things \nAnd \nUh \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nUh \nWe had to be careful about that \nWe had like drills \nAnd \nEven though that doesn't have anything to do with the \nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nUh \nThat was in case people would come into the building I guess \nUh \nSo we \nYou know \nWe did practice that stuff \nUh \nIn order to make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's just what the school officials were doing in this case \nThey were just making it a safer place \nUh \nPreventing anything bad from happening \nLike \nColumbine or something like that \nUh \nYeah that's basically all I can think of \n\nUh no that's about it",
            "At first, I was all for war because I was affected by nine eleven personally. I thought we should go over there and cause just as much chaos as they did here. But I think since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. I really think that it backfired on us. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're fighting with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I've almost just stopped caring about what goes on over there. I just don't care. I think sometimes I don't even think they're human. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't do anything themselves, so I really don't care. We definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different from war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there, and I think that's fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. I also think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. But at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.\" So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't have unity. They didn't know what they were going into for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And, honestly, I don't have anything else to say. Our discussion has definitely gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. We can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are a bit outdated. The Catholic Church has been talking about how they are losing some of their followers. I think this is because the Catholic Church is not very open to many things. For example, gay marriage, abortion, birth control - they have very strong views on them. Their views on these things might be reasonable, but some are outdated. If they could adapt to some more modern ways of thinking, they wouldn't be afraid of losing followers.\n\nMany people are starting to feel disenchanted with the Catholic Church because of their views on these things. Some people are starting to disagree with them on these issues. So, I think the Catholic Church's views are probably wrong. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not want to join a church that teaches it's completely wrong and you're going against it.\n\nSimilarly, if you support gay marriage, you might not want to join a church that doesn't agree with that. The Catholic Church doesn't allow women to be priests, so if you support that change, you might not want to join a church that opposes women priests.\n\nI don't think there's any reason why priests can't get married or women can't be priests. They say priests are already married to God and have completely dedicated their lives to God. But almost everyone has their job and family life, and they care about other things. So, I don't think priests can't have both their work and family life.",
            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage personally, I think it's unfair to blame gay people for their sexual orientation. It seems like it's not a choice, it's just the way they were born. I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious decision. It's not right for the government to say that a man and a woman can get married but two people of the same sex can't. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a security issue or a moral issue, it's just a personal choice. It's not their place to intervene in people's lives. Being gay is just who they are, and that's not something to be punished for.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized because there isn't a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are many different aspects to it that it can never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that come along with it such as property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can't be in the room with you if you're sick. And can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And homosexual couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples do. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people like Catholics can get hung up on \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing\" but in a legal sense if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the kids aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beat up and stuff like that. Parents protest to get the kid removed from their school and it's just a kid I mean they're gonna have the same points of view and everything parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue making gay marriage legal in every state I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I know that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. Alright, I mean, if it has benefits, then it's okay for medical purposes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. It's not that beneficial. You know what I mean. Yeah, alright, I mean there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like aspirin, amoxicillin, and codeine, and those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they have benefits, and if you deny those benefits, it's like because there's a taboo around marijuana, A, there's no point in doing that for me. I think you should embrace its benefits. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, it can lead to bad things. Alright, it's a tough one, I'd say no, you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once, because then it would be abused, but if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, alright, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but I mean it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Alright, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. No.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. \nIt's not as strict as it used to be. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. \nAnd I would wear cute little dresses. \nAnd matching shoes. \nAnd a matching purse. \nAnd that was just every time I went to church. \nI went to a private school. \nAnd I would see all my friends there on the weekends. \nAnd we would just go. \nBut now as I've gotten older, they've made like a teenager mass. \nAnd they cut it down to 30 minutes. \nAnd people dress a lot more casually. \nDuring the summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. \nYou'd have the families there that are just running in late. \nSo I think it has become more casual. \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis. \nWell khakis are nice too. \nBut just a lot more casual in terms of that. \nAs for other things, that's the biggest thing that I noticed. \nLike that's the church I know. \nI don't know the politics within the church and what not. \nBut yeah, that's it. \n[Okay, um, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests concerning pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to get married?] \nUm, I don't think that these things could have been avoided. \nBecause there are men who are married and they still become pedophiles and they still have an attraction towards young kids. \nSo I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. \nUm, I think also when they become a priest it's their choice to become a priest. \nUm, there are religions that they're allowed to get married where they could be. \nLike on Seventh Heaven, I don't know what kind of religion it is, he's a reverend or a minister or something. \n[Mm hmm.] \nBut they're allowed to get married. \nSo I know it's a little different. \nBut if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith. \n[Okay can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] \nUm, on which part? \nAbout... \n[Um.] \nJust the changing ways. \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] \nOh, on pedophilia. \n[Mm hmm.] \nUm, I think, like the whole... \nUm, the issue of sex before being a pedophile. \nI think it's based on genetics. \nI don't think people just become it. \nI think they're born that way. \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case. \nBut I think it's their genetics. \nAnd you can't hide that through marriage. \nYou could try, but it would usually come out. \nSo I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. \nUm, if they knew about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them. \nBut I don't think in all cases they knew. \n[Okay do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] \nUm, no.",
            "(laughs) \nUm, initially I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks and that we sort of went into Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false. And that's very much rubbed me the wrong way and generally the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. \n\nUm, it just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, at least since September 11th. I mean, they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nUm, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. But it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration, and I think that in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. Um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems, because, um, Iraq's sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue, there, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. That um, oh I can't remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process, or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and I mean we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government. And I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUm, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I started to wonder if I should just talk about something.  Okay, cool.  Uh-huh.  Okay, I'm sorry.  Okay.  How do I feel about the Iraq War?  Let me think.  Uh.  At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because I mean it's not even a declared war actually.  And I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S. like who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven.  So I don't feel like I'm very involved in the War in Iraq.  So I don't really keep up with it.  I don't know the big details of it.  But at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them. But it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset.  So and then like if we stay over there, then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day.  And then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.  Uh.  Let me think.  Ohh this is so hard.  This is the one topic I don't know anything about.  Uh.  War in Iraq. Oh this is hard.  Uh.  Mmm.  Uhh I don't know.  Do you have anything else I can go off of?  Okay.  Thank you.  Um.  Well, um.  Actually, I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair.  I don't think we should call it a war anymore.  But because I don't think that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that you know that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns.  But I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it.  It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress.  I think that's how the whole thing works.  You have to declare a war by congress and then it's.  I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try.  Actually no.  I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them.  But it's also like wasting our resources.  And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever because he started this meaningless war and stuff so huh you have to make this a half an hour don't you uh okay yeah um huh I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",

            "The war in Iraq\n\nOkay\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nI don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war\nBefore invading Iraq, I think they\nI think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, when in reality, they didn't have much to do with each other\nHowever, the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003\nUh\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war so\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against that\nUh\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with\n\nI mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died\n\nAnd that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the country's government and I really don't think the government, the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur\nUh\nAnd the government and the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out the Communists and implement and uphold democracy\nAnd it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear loss in Vietnam because\nBecause there were there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country and the specific citizens in the country and so I think the government should have been more prepared for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean it's not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government and we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't have been so naive because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful\n\nI mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war and it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and uh so so let's see the war in Iraq\n\nWell that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see uh I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "I won't say it, but as an RA, I've had to deal with this before. When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum, completely public. You can't. I mean, I was saying that as an RA, I've already dealt with it. You put something out there, it's going to color people's opinions of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there, put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to act on that. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something does happen, they could have prevented it. [Right] So you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just fooling around. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. I don't know, I forgot the word. And it could also be something very serious. I think. Well, what happened here was that something happened, and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, and then they called it in. When we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook, and they were worried because there were some things on there that they might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, it became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be befriending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs, but if it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. I mean, like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing. I wouldn't befriend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that, and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. That's not really it.",
            "I think this war has been prolonged for too long. The initial purpose was good, to restore democracy in another country. But now I think we have lost sight of that initial purpose. We may be doing it just to prove that we are a superpower in the world, just to prove ourselves. Perhaps the motives were questionable due to the problems with Saddam Hussein at the time.\n\nIf the initial purpose was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation. But if there were personal vendettas involved, that wouldn't be fair.\n\nI think we conveyed our purpose when we first started the war, and that in itself was a statement. But the fact that it has gone on for over a year is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to save a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a justifiable reason for the war. But I think our reason has been distorted over time. It seems like we're still at war for the sake of war. We don't just want to end the war, we want to win.\n\nI think this war has gone on for too long. Their government officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. I think that time has come.

War shouldn't be a long-term expense.\n\nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as poverty, education, highway construction, schools, and healthcare.

            "I mean, we only have this and then one more time I get to talk about the Iraq War. I mean, I feel embarrassed saying this, but I hate joining the bandwagon of people who say they were against it from the beginning. I was, but it's not really important anymore because everyone in the world thinks it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, I mean, just look at the recent polls. They've done United States polls, Iraqi polls, and global polls, and I mean, no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of troops stationed there. It's like the US troops stationed there now think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within a year. I don't know, it's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster, and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. I mean, I think it's just the cultural clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big of a gap for this administration, or any administration, to understand. They think they can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy, no one's arguing that. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went in. I don't even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason to stay in there. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas about why it's better to stay in there, and the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don't agree with them. I haven't heard a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to gradually pull out over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read a statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year, and at least a quarter of them think we should just leave now. And like these are the people we're trying to save, we're trying to help, telling us to leave. I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely falls apart, we could say, \"We wanted to stay in, but you guys made the decision to leave.\" Then, you know, at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States, especially in certain specific fields of work.  Although it's not just women who face these problems, I think women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even if society promotes equality, a lot of people have a hard time accepting a woman in a leadership position.  The values that have been cultivated in society for a long time make it difficult for people to accept women in leadership positions in the workplace.  Sometimes women will see a job that is suitable for them and have the necessary qualifications, but are refused promotion to a higher position because of historical reasons.  The same thing happens to men, especially in the fashion industry and as stay-at-home dads.  Society tends to expect men to be the main breadwinners of the family and looks down on them when they decide to be stay-at-home dads, because they think they should be working.  This makes it difficult for men because their dream is to be with their kids and help raise them, and maybe their wife has a better job and it works out fine for them.  However, society looks down on them for their choice.  Also, men in the fashion industry may not be taken seriously because they are men.  Typically, men who are into fashion have different lifestyles, so if you have a typical lifestyle as a man and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Well, how do I really know if you know what fashion is for women?  You don't really know what our case is like.  Like those other guys.\"  Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.  To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've made great progress from the 1800s, but change is slow.  So I feel that if we continue working at our current pace because women are rising to higher positions, becoming CEOs, and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more, and just as men who are stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job, or she wants to be the one who works.\"  And, um, then for like fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their female friends or their wives, and stuff,\" and so they do know where I'm coming from.  So I guess you kinda have to, in a way, promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy, but um, saying like the qualities of them.  Because if you force it, people will resist.  And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that.  So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way, and change takes time.  Yes.  Um.  Well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from.  Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn't the best, but you are extremely intelligent, and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down on you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\"  So, yeah.  So, like, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender.  And I don't know.  I guess that'd be another example.  Um, not really.",
            "Well, I think they didn’t fully legalize it. \nThey decriminalized it. \nUm, which knocked it down from a crime to more like a traffic ticket. \nYou know, something you just get fined for, rather than having to be booked and arrested and brought in, and all that. \nAnd I think if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know, for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, \nUm, those types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be there. \nBut at the same time, there's an argument that, um, it costs a lot to arrest people and bring them in and book them, \nand to house them and then let them go, \nand then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, \nand then appoint a public defender, \nand then you have to pay the judge, and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. \nAnd um, I mean so, \nWhen you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for them, \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. \nBut in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, \nI have to use the word liberal, \nBut you know what I mean, \nKind of, uh, \nKind of open-minded. \nThen I think it's totally fine. \nAnd I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, \nthat they can spend on social programs for the elderly, \nand that they can spend on \nYou know, food programs for homeless people. \nUm, I mean so, \nI think it's \nIt's important, I mean, marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, \nAll over the streets and stuff, \nUm, I mean for a variety of reasons, \nBut there's this whole like financial element to it as well, \nOther reasons like, \nWhy it shouldn't be fully \nWell no, \nI mean I \nI don't know how I would feel about \nWell, if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes, where it could be sold in gas stations, and people would be smoking it everywhere. \nThen I mean, \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, \nAnd um, \nIt still is like taboo in our society, \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts, \nUh, \nTo smoke marijuana. \nSo, \nTo have it out in the open like that, \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. \nUm, \nAnd, \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low. \nUm, \nI don’t really know. \nUm, \nI think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. \nUm, \nBut I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyles, \nAs opposed to just their decision-making, motor skills. \nI mean, \nBut they, \nThey both have their adverse effects, \nAnd I mean, they, \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general, \nLike no two people really react the same way. \nI mean, and then people, \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal, and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. \nSo, \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, \nWhen people react differently. \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. \nUm, yeah, \nUh, \nNo, I don’t.",

            "I still haven't made up my mind on this matter. I haven't decided which side is correct. But I think this is the most complicated issue we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a very complicated issue. If we can't avoid hurting anyone, I don't know. I think all civil unions. I don't know if marriage should be looked at as. Because it's considered a sacrament, people shouldn't get tax breaks or be looked at in a specific way by the government if they were baptized. So if you're married, I think the government should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is. It's two people. They shouldn't separate church and state. They shouldn't look into what kind of marriage it was. Two people got united. So, the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people got a civil union. Well, if all the states come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution just because some people think it's important. But it's not a big enough issue to be a constitutional amendment.

But I think it should be legalized. However, I think it shouldn't be a national issue, but should be decided by each state rather than like the president deciding for the entire country. In fact, many states are democratic and many states are republican. Democratic states will definitely support gay marriage, and republican states will definitely not. Therefore, if you live in a democratic state, you should respect the stance of that state because you chose it. So I think homosexuals should enjoy the same rights as heterosexuals, so it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. In fact, I've already answered that. However, I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. My idea is that only when a state decides should each state decide for itself. This is mainly because Bush won't be living in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should operate. Finally, I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, Bush will be out of office in about two years. If a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president.",
            "I think \nNo, I completely disagree. \nUh, let me think, I believe \nI think \nMyspace is a public platform \nAnd \nAlso, a bulletin board \nYou know \nIf you look at that definition \nUh, then \nYou know \nIt's basically for the public to see \nOr others to see \nUh, whatever you're trying to express \nAnd \nNow, if you post that on the internet \nUh, you know \nYou have to be aware that people will see it \nWhether it be school officials or not \nUh, so I think school officials seeing that \nThey had every right to see it \nBecause \nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name \nThey could still access that through their homes \nUh \nBut \nYes, that's to prevent school shooting \nYou know \nAs long as it saves the lives of \nUh \nStudents \nWhich is the responsibility of the school system \nI think that \nUh \nThat's perfectly fine \nLet me see here \nFor example \nUh \nYou know \nIf they go on the internet, like on Myspace, just to see if \nYou know \nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing things they're not supposed to be doing \nThey go there just specifically to catch students \nAnd \nTo get them in trouble \nAnd \nI think that's an invasion of privacy \nBut \nUh \nI think \nYou know \nAs long as they save \nYou know \nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place \nI don't think that's an invasion at all \nUh \nShould I elaborate more on that \n\nYes, uh \nAlright \nWell \nUh \nIt's a lot easier to \nUh \nExpress yourself \nUh \nA lot longer when you're writing \nBut \n\nAlright \nWell \nUh \nLike what I was saying \nIt is a public thing \nUh \nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace \nAnd \nNot expecting to get in trouble \nThat's ridiculous \nUh \nEverything \nLike I'm \nUh \nAfraid to post stuff like even through emails \nUh \nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email \nBecause \nI'm afraid someone will see it \nAnd \nYou know \nEverything nowadays comes back \nAnd \nYou know \nIt bites you in the butt I guess you could say \n\nUh \nLike \nYou know \nIf you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will find an email that you sent somehow \nAnd \nLike \nOnce it's on the internet it's always on the internet \nAnd \nUh \nYou know \nIf you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it \nYou will get in trouble \nAnd \nI don't \nIt wasn't an invasion of privacy at all \nBecause \nYou know \nLike I said before \nAnd \nWell that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing \nAnd \nUh \nI don't know \nLet's see here \n\nUh \nLike I had said before I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students \nBut \nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place \nUh \nThen I think that's perfectly fine for them \nOr \nUh \nOther officials such as the police to go on \nUh \nYou know \nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel like \nYou know \nThey're dropping them off at a safe place \nI've actually discussed this with a \nUh \nA \nUh \nTeacher of mine \nI went to a public high school \nAnd \nUh \nThey said \nYou know \nWe have to ensure things like this \nBecause \nLike \nWe would do like lockdowns \nAnd \nOther things \nAnd \nUh \nThat's in reference to the terrorist attacks \nUh \nWe had to be careful about that \nWe had like drills \nAnd \nEven though that doesn't have anything to do with the \nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting \nBecause \nUh \nThat was in case people would come into the building I guess \nUh \nSo we \nYou know \nWe did practice that stuff \nUh \nIn order to make the school a safer place \nAnd \nThat's just what the school officials were doing in this case \nThey were just making it a safer place \nUh \nPreventing anything bad from happening \nLike \nColumbine or something like that \nUh \nYeah that's basically all I can think of \n\nUh no that's about it",
            "At first, I was all for war because I was affected by nine eleven personally. I thought we should go over there and cause just as much chaos as they did here. But I think since it was such an emotional thing that happened, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan. I really think that it backfired on us. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like, I don't think us being over there is going to do anything if they're fighting with themselves. So, unfortunately, because of nine eleven, I've almost just stopped caring about what goes on over there. I just don't care. I think sometimes I don't even think they're human. I don't know, they fight with each other and they can't do anything themselves, so I really don't care. We definitely went over there unprepared. We didn't know what we were going to face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different from war for us. They're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country. I just think they're looking to get us out of there, and I think that's fine for us. I think we should just leave and that's really it. We just, I think we were just more hyped up than anything. I don't think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. I also think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. But at the time, I see where he was coming from. We really didn't have a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say, \"Okay, let's rebuild and that's it.\" So, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do. I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess, creating order. And I don't know, I just think that they didn't have unity. They didn't know what they were going into for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Honestly, I don't think we're the ones to change those people. I honestly think they're always going to be like that. And, honestly, I don't have anything else to say. Our discussion has definitely gone on long enough. I don't think we're making enough progress. We've made progress, but not enough to stay in there. And I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just going to collapse. We can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change. They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't object to same-sex marriage. Well, I think it's not a conscious choice, whether you're born that way or whatever. I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but not two people of the same sex. It seems like it's not a choice, like they don't have a choice in how they are. I was born straight, and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I don't think they should be judged or put on a stage, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives, and that's just who they are - like they were born that way or at least that's what I think. And I think they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can be in the room with you if you're sick and can visit. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Okay, so first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer you know. Even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean there are a bunch of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And they're controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things as well, it's a tough one. I'd say not. You could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, I mean people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. Nope",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nI think now it's not as strict as it used to be.\nI remember that when I was younger, I went to church every Sunday.\nI would wear cute little dresses, \nmatching shoes, \nand a matching purse, \nThis was my time in private school, \nI would meet my friends on weekends, \nWe would just go, \nBut now as I've grown older, they've made like a teenager's mass, \nThey shortened it to 30 minutes, \nPeople dress more casually, \nEspecially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach, \nYou'll see families running late, \nI think it's become more casual, \nEven at morning masses where I used to dress up, \nPeople wear jeans and khakis, \nOh, khakis are nice too, \nBut it's a lot more casual compared to that, \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed, \nThat's the church I know, \nI don't know the politics of the church and whatnot, \nBut yes, \n[Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nI don't think these things could have been avoided, \nBecause, \nThere are men who are married, \nAnd they still become pedophiles, \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids, \nSo, \nI think even if they got married, it's just the person, \nIt's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married, \nI think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest, \nUh, \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, like in Seventh Heaven, \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something, \n[Mm hmm]\nThey're allowed to get married, \nSo, \nI know it's a little different, \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith, \n[Can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?]\nUh, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Uh]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUh, \nI think, \nLike the whole \nUh, \nSexuality before \nAbout being genetic \nI think it's based on genetics, \nI don't think people \nUh, \nJust become it, \nI think they're born that way, \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up, \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, \nBut \nI think it's their genetics, \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage, \nYou could try, \nBut \nThen it would usually come out, \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening, \nUh, \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew, \n[Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUh, no",
            "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood feud against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think in the long run, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. (um) I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long run, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um... Oh I can't remember his name, the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Moqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious, radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I feel like this war is pointless because it's not even a declared war actually. I think it was just a big revenge thing because that's who we thought did the 9/11 attacks. I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't know the details of it, but I think we're just staying there to try and build democracy so it can be like the U.S. and also to get oil and stuff from them. But there's no reason to stay there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. It's hard to say I want them to stay in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States, which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like we're just going to make the Al-Kaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. They've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years. I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took their home and their stuff and now they don't have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because I don't think that there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by Congress and then it's and I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them but it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember the whole Vietnam thing the Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so I think it's a half an hour don't you?",
            "I don't really think it's reasonable to make it a law or for the government to decide it's legal. I think it should be up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear that it's written in the constitution. Trying to use power to enforce it would be in defiance of what's already written in stone in the constitution. So, I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs against another. Because we can see that most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some other areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches are allowed to make illegal and legal. And well, the separation of church and state is a very key aspect of the constitution, which is what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to make an amendment, I think it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already written there. And also, I think it would be one of the only amendments that restrict the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right at all in that aspect.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nNot quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, the war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. It's all about the money and controlling resources. I mean, another one of the predispositions before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet, places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, but we're not making any attacks against them. So, I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. Let's see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm, I've always been for gay marriage. I think it's a personal preference and uh, it's been proven that it's more biological than sociological, so we shouldn't take away their rights due to something they can't control. It's just not humane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics and government should have a say in this, because it's not a national issue, it's a personal issue and a family issue. You know, in my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. You know, they're just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would. And I think if Bush tries to play God here and interpret the meaning of marriage, it's just ridiculous. \n\nOf course, yeah. I mean I think, I believe I've read and heard from numerous different uh publications and TV reports or newspapers and stuff that it's a chemical thing that's proved they might be predisposed to be homosexual. It's not something about growing up with four sisters and being the only brother and not having a father that has anything to do with it. So that's the biological side, not the sociological side. \n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone, just run off to Las Vegas and get married, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times, you know? I think it's just a personal, private matter that should be left to the individual, not a public or national issue. \n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. As an R.A. I've already dealt with this before. When you put something out there, it will influence people's opinions of you. If you're talking about explosions or shootings, someone will say something. You can't put that out there. Put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin. Someone went to the school and told them. They have to take action. If something doesn't happen, they can prevent it. Then again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just joking around. Like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. It could be a social network experiment, like a lab experiment. When you put something on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't tell them. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them. And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",
            "I think this war has been dragged out for too long. I think the initial goal was good. I think it was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that goal. Now we're just maybe fighting to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation was related to George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think if it was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would be fair. But I think the war has already dragged on for too long. I think we conveyed our message in the first couple of months, starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. However, the fact that it has continued for over a year or several years, I think that's too long.\n\nYes, I think... I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think... I think our reason has deteriorated and been misconstrued. It seems like we're still at war just for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to end this without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYes, I do think it has gone on long enough and should stop. I think the government and their officials will eventually have to fend for themselves anyway. I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war, while we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think this is a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been dragged out.\n\nYes, I mean we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. We have many problems, such as poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, and so on. We have many problems that need funding. Our healthcare should get more funding. Right now, that money is being spent on having some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification question. Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "It's like a totally different group of people's way of living. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy; no one's arguing that he wasn't. But, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand, from the moment we went over there. I mean, it's not like we can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. That's not the way that totally different groups of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out; I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still sexism in the United States. It's not just about women; I think it's about the specific field of work you're in. I believe women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even with the theory of equality, many people still have a hard time accepting female leaders. This is because society has had a preconceived notion for a long time. Therefore, women often find themselves qualified for a job, but are rejected, because people think women shouldn't be in high positions. Similarly, men face similar challenges in certain fields, such as fashion and childcare. Usually, the parent is the woman, and the man is expected to be the breadwinner. If a man chooses to stay home and care for the children, society looks down on them: \"You should be the one earning money for the family.\" This puts a lot of pressure on them, as they may have originally wanted to be the primary caregivers, while their wives have better jobs. And in the fashion industry, people will doubt a man's authenticity: \"You're not a true fashion enthusiast; your style doesn't fit the industry standards.\" People question his professionalism, worrying he can't understand women's needs. This also relates to geographical background, because some people may have regional cultural biases against women or men. To change this, we need to gradually promote understanding and acceptance of different groups. We need to avoid forced promotion and instead showcase their strengths and abilities. If we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. So, we need to gradually push for this change, allowing people to slowly accept it. We've made great progress, and change takes time. Actually, besides sexism, geographical background can also lead to other forms of discrimination.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they just decriminalized it, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there's an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them, like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open liberal track, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean, so I think it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like why it shouldn't necessarily be, well, no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know. I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I'd say yes it's because a lot of what they do is very traditional like they've done the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their like pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm maybe but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",

            "I was actually raised in a Christian home so to speak, homosexuality is a kind of gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. Um, I think I don't completely agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be determined by each state rather than the country as a whole. Um, many states are democratic, many states are republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know the state's stance on this issue. Um, I don't think you have the right to disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage because you chose to live there, you know. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it. Um, I've already answered that. But, uh, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide whether the whole country should oppose gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. I just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Um, so I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I, uh, no, I don't agree at all. I think about it, let me see, in my opinion, MySpace is a public place, and a bulletin, you know, if you look at that definition, then you know, it's basically for the public and others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here, like, uh, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know, students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, but, um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",
            "I was completely for it at first because I was affected by 9/11 personally. I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change. They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't object to same-sex marriage. Well, I think it's not a conscious choice, whether you're born that way or whatever. I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but not two people of the same sex. It seems like it's not a choice, like they don't have a choice in how they are. I was born straight, and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I don't think they should be judged or put on a stage, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives, and that's just who they are - like they were born that way or at least that's what I think. And I think they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can be in the room with you if you're sick and can visit. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Okay, so first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer you know. Even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean there are a bunch of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And they're controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things as well, it's a tough one. I'd say not. You could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, I mean people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. Nope",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nI think now it's not as strict as it used to be.\nI remember that when I was younger, I went to church every Sunday.\nI would wear cute little dresses, \nmatching shoes, \nand a matching purse, \nThis was my time in private school, \nI would meet my friends on weekends, \nWe would just go, \nBut now as I've grown older, they've made like a teenager's mass, \nThey shortened it to 30 minutes, \nPeople dress more casually, \nEspecially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach, \nYou'll see families running late, \nI think it's become more casual, \nEven at morning masses where I used to dress up, \nPeople wear jeans and khakis, \nOh, khakis are nice too, \nBut it's a lot more casual compared to that, \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed, \nThat's the church I know, \nI don't know the politics of the church and whatnot, \nBut yes, \n[Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nI don't think these things could have been avoided, \nBecause, \nThere are men who are married, \nAnd they still become pedophiles, \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids, \nSo, \nI think even if they got married, it's just the person, \nIt's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married, \nI think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest, \nUh, \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, like in Seventh Heaven, \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something, \n[Mm hmm]\nThey're allowed to get married, \nSo, \nI know it's a little different, \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith, \n[Can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?]\nUh, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Uh]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUh, \nI think, \nLike the whole \nUh, \nSexuality before \nAbout being genetic \nI think it's based on genetics, \nI don't think people \nUh, \nJust become it, \nI think they're born that way, \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up, \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, \nBut \nI think it's their genetics, \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage, \nYou could try, \nBut \nThen it would usually come out, \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening, \nUh, \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew, \n[Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUh, no",
            "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood feud against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think in the long run, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. (um) I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long run, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um... Oh I can't remember his name, the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Moqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious, radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I feel like this war is pointless because it's not even a declared war actually. I think it was just a big revenge thing because that's who we thought did the 9/11 attacks. I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't know the details of it, but I think we're just staying there to try and build democracy so it can be like the U.S. and also to get oil and stuff from them. But there's no reason to stay there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. It's hard to say I want them to stay in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States, which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like we're just going to make the Al-Kaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. They've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years. I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took their home and their stuff and now they don't have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because I don't think that there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by Congress and then it's and I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them but it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember the whole Vietnam thing the Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so I think it's a half an hour don't you?",
            "I don't really think it's reasonable to make it a law or for the government to decide it's legal. I think it should be up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear that it's written in the constitution. Trying to use power to enforce it would be in defiance of what's already written in stone in the constitution. So, I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs against another. Because we can see that most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some other areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches are allowed to make illegal and legal. And well, the separation of church and state is a very key aspect of the constitution, which is what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to make an amendment, I think it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already written there. And also, I think it would be one of the only amendments that restrict the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right at all in that aspect.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nNot quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, the war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. It's all about the money and controlling resources. I mean, another one of the predispositions before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet, places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, but we're not making any attacks against them. So, I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. Let's see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm, I've always been for gay marriage. I think it's a personal preference and uh, it's been proven that it's more biological than sociological, so we shouldn't take away their rights due to something they can't control. It's just not humane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics and government should have a say in this, because it's not a national issue, it's a personal issue and a family issue. You know, in my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. You know, they're just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would. And I think if Bush tries to play God here and interpret the meaning of marriage, it's just ridiculous. \n\nOf course, yeah. I mean I think, I believe I've read and heard from numerous different uh publications and TV reports or newspapers and stuff that it's a chemical thing that's proved they might be predisposed to be homosexual. It's not something about growing up with four sisters and being the only brother and not having a father that has anything to do with it. So that's the biological side, not the sociological side. \n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone, just run off to Las Vegas and get married, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times, you know? I think it's just a personal, private matter that should be left to the individual, not a public or national issue. \n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. As an R.A. I've already dealt with this before. When you put something out there, it will influence people's opinions of you. If you're talking about explosions or shootings, someone will say something. You can't put that out there. Put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin. Someone went to the school and told them. They have to take action. If something doesn't happen, they can prevent it. Then again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just joking around. Like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. It could be a social network experiment, like a lab experiment. When you put something on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't tell them. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them. And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",
            "I think this war has been dragged out for too long. I think the initial goal was good. I think it was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that goal. Now we're just maybe fighting to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation was related to George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think if it was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would be fair. But I think the war has already dragged on for too long. I think we conveyed our message in the first couple of months, starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. However, the fact that it has continued for over a year or several years, I think that's too long.\n\nYes, I think... I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think... I think our reason has deteriorated and been misconstrued. It seems like we're still at war just for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to end this without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYes, I do think it has gone on long enough and should stop. I think the government and their officials will eventually have to fend for themselves anyway. I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war, while we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think this is a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been dragged out.\n\nYes, I mean we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. We have many problems, such as poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, and so on. We have many problems that need funding. Our healthcare should get more funding. Right now, that money is being spent on having some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification question. Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "It's like a totally different group of people's way of living. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy; no one's arguing that he wasn't. But, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand, from the moment we went over there. I mean, it's not like we can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. That's not the way that totally different groups of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out; I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still sexism in the United States. It's not just about women; I think it's about the specific field of work you're in. I believe women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even with the theory of equality, many people still have a hard time accepting female leaders. This is because society has had a preconceived notion for a long time. Therefore, women often find themselves qualified for a job, but are rejected, because people think women shouldn't be in high positions. Similarly, men face similar challenges in certain fields, such as fashion and childcare. Usually, the parent is the woman, and the man is expected to be the breadwinner. If a man chooses to stay home and care for the children, society looks down on them: \"You should be the one earning money for the family.\" This puts a lot of pressure on them, as they may have originally wanted to be the primary caregivers, while their wives have better jobs. And in the fashion industry, people will doubt a man's authenticity: \"You're not a true fashion enthusiast; your style doesn't fit the industry standards.\" People question his professionalism, worrying he can't understand women's needs. This also relates to geographical background, because some people may have regional cultural biases against women or men. To change this, we need to gradually promote understanding and acceptance of different groups. We need to avoid forced promotion and instead showcase their strengths and abilities. If we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. So, we need to gradually push for this change, allowing people to slowly accept it. We've made great progress, and change takes time. Actually, besides sexism, geographical background can also lead to other forms of discrimination.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they just decriminalized it, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there's an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them, like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open liberal track, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean, so I think it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like why it shouldn't necessarily be, well, no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know. I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I'd say yes it's because a lot of what they do is very traditional like they've done the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their like pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm maybe but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",

            "I was actually raised in a Christian home so to speak, homosexuality is a kind of gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. Um, I think I don't completely agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be determined by each state rather than the country as a whole. Um, many states are democratic, many states are republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know the state's stance on this issue. Um, I don't think you have the right to disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage because you chose to live there, you know. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it. Um, I've already answered that. But, uh, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide whether the whole country should oppose gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. I just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Um, so I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I, uh, no, I don't agree at all. I think about it, let me see, in my opinion, MySpace is a public place, and a bulletin, you know, if you look at that definition, then you know, it's basically for the public and others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here, like, uh, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know, students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, but, um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",
            "I was completely for it at first because I was affected by 9/11 personally. I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change. They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't object to same-sex marriage. Well, I think it's not a conscious choice, whether you're born that way or whatever. I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but not two people of the same sex. It seems like it's not a choice, like they don't have a choice in how they are. I was born straight, and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I don't think they should be judged or put on a stage, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives, and that's just who they are - like they were born that way or at least that's what I think. And I think they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can be in the room with you if you're sick and can visit. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Okay, so first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer you know. Even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean there are a bunch of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And they're controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things as well, it's a tough one. I'd say not. You could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, I mean people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. Nope",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nI think now it's not as strict as it used to be.\nI remember that when I was younger, I went to church every Sunday.\nI would wear cute little dresses, \nmatching shoes, \nand a matching purse, \nThis was my time in private school, \nI would meet my friends on weekends, \nWe would just go, \nBut now as I've grown older, they've made like a teenager's mass, \nThey shortened it to 30 minutes, \nPeople dress more casually, \nEspecially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach, \nYou'll see families running late, \nI think it's become more casual, \nEven at morning masses where I used to dress up, \nPeople wear jeans and khakis, \nOh, khakis are nice too, \nBut it's a lot more casual compared to that, \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed, \nThat's the church I know, \nI don't know the politics of the church and whatnot, \nBut yes, \n[Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nI don't think these things could have been avoided, \nBecause, \nThere are men who are married, \nAnd they still become pedophiles, \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids, \nSo, \nI think even if they got married, it's just the person, \nIt's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married, \nI think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest, \nUh, \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, like in Seventh Heaven, \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something, \n[Mm hmm]\nThey're allowed to get married, \nSo, \nI know it's a little different, \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith, \n[Can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?]\nUh, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Uh]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUh, \nI think, \nLike the whole \nUh, \nSexuality before \nAbout being genetic \nI think it's based on genetics, \nI don't think people \nUh, \nJust become it, \nI think they're born that way, \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up, \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, \nBut \nI think it's their genetics, \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage, \nYou could try, \nBut \nThen it would usually come out, \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening, \nUh, \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew, \n[Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUh, no",
            "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood feud against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think in the long run, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. (um) I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long run, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um... Oh I can't remember his name, the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Moqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious, radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I feel like this war is pointless because it's not even a declared war actually. I think it was just a big revenge thing because that's who we thought did the 9/11 attacks. I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't know the details of it, but I think we're just staying there to try and build democracy so it can be like the U.S. and also to get oil and stuff from them. But there's no reason to stay there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. It's hard to say I want them to stay in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States, which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like we're just going to make the Al-Kaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. They've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years. I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took their home and their stuff and now they don't have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because I don't think that there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by Congress and then it's and I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them but it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember the whole Vietnam thing the Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so I think it's a half an hour don't you?",
            "I don't really think it's reasonable to make it a law or for the government to decide it's legal. I think it should be up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear that it's written in the constitution. Trying to use power to enforce it would be in defiance of what's already written in stone in the constitution. So, I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs against another. Because we can see that most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some other areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches are allowed to make illegal and legal. And well, the separation of church and state is a very key aspect of the constitution, which is what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to make an amendment, I think it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already written there. And also, I think it would be one of the only amendments that restrict the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right at all in that aspect.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nNot quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, the war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. It's all about the money and controlling resources. I mean, another one of the predispositions before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet, places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, but we're not making any attacks against them. So, I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. Let's see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm, I've always been for gay marriage. I think it's a personal preference and uh, it's been proven that it's more biological than sociological, so we shouldn't take away their rights due to something they can't control. It's just not humane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics and government should have a say in this, because it's not a national issue, it's a personal issue and a family issue. You know, in my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. You know, they're just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would. And I think if Bush tries to play God here and interpret the meaning of marriage, it's just ridiculous. \n\nOf course, yeah. I mean I think, I believe I've read and heard from numerous different uh publications and TV reports or newspapers and stuff that it's a chemical thing that's proved they might be predisposed to be homosexual. It's not something about growing up with four sisters and being the only brother and not having a father that has anything to do with it. So that's the biological side, not the sociological side. \n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone, just run off to Las Vegas and get married, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times, you know? I think it's just a personal, private matter that should be left to the individual, not a public or national issue. \n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. As an R.A. I've already dealt with this before. When you put something out there, it will influence people's opinions of you. If you're talking about explosions or shootings, someone will say something. You can't put that out there. Put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin. Someone went to the school and told them. They have to take action. If something doesn't happen, they can prevent it. Then again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just joking around. Like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. It could be a social network experiment, like a lab experiment. When you put something on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't tell them. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them. And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",
            "I think this war has been dragged out for too long. I think the initial goal was good. I think it was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that goal. Now we're just maybe fighting to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation was related to George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think if it was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would be fair. But I think the war has already dragged on for too long. I think we conveyed our message in the first couple of months, starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. However, the fact that it has continued for over a year or several years, I think that's too long.\n\nYes, I think... I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think... I think our reason has deteriorated and been misconstrued. It seems like we're still at war just for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to end this without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYes, I do think it has gone on long enough and should stop. I think the government and their officials will eventually have to fend for themselves anyway. I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war, while we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think this is a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been dragged out.\n\nYes, I mean we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. We have many problems, such as poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, and so on. We have many problems that need funding. Our healthcare should get more funding. Right now, that money is being spent on having some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification question. Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "It's like a totally different group of people's way of living. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy; no one's arguing that he wasn't. But, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand, from the moment we went over there. I mean, it's not like we can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. That's not the way that totally different groups of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out; I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still sexism in the United States. It's not just about women; I think it's about the specific field of work you're in. I believe women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even with the theory of equality, many people still have a hard time accepting female leaders. This is because society has had a preconceived notion for a long time. Therefore, women often find themselves qualified for a job, but are rejected, because people think women shouldn't be in high positions. Similarly, men face similar challenges in certain fields, such as fashion and childcare. Usually, the parent is the woman, and the man is expected to be the breadwinner. If a man chooses to stay home and care for the children, society looks down on them: \"You should be the one earning money for the family.\" This puts a lot of pressure on them, as they may have originally wanted to be the primary caregivers, while their wives have better jobs. And in the fashion industry, people will doubt a man's authenticity: \"You're not a true fashion enthusiast; your style doesn't fit the industry standards.\" People question his professionalism, worrying he can't understand women's needs. This also relates to geographical background, because some people may have regional cultural biases against women or men. To change this, we need to gradually promote understanding and acceptance of different groups. We need to avoid forced promotion and instead showcase their strengths and abilities. If we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. So, we need to gradually push for this change, allowing people to slowly accept it. We've made great progress, and change takes time. Actually, besides sexism, geographical background can also lead to other forms of discrimination.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they just decriminalized it, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there's an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them, like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open liberal track, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean, so I think it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like why it shouldn't necessarily be, well, no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know. I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I'd say yes it's because a lot of what they do is very traditional like they've done the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their like pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm maybe but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",

            "I was actually raised in a Christian home so to speak, homosexuality is a kind of gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. Um, I think I don't completely agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be determined by each state rather than the country as a whole. Um, many states are democratic, many states are republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know the state's stance on this issue. Um, I don't think you have the right to disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage because you chose to live there, you know. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it. Um, I've already answered that. But, uh, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide whether the whole country should oppose gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. I just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Um, so I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I, uh, no, I don't agree at all. I think about it, let me see, in my opinion, MySpace is a public place, and a bulletin, you know, if you look at that definition, then you know, it's basically for the public and others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here, like, uh, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know, students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, but, um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",
            "I was completely for it at first because I was affected by 9/11 personally. I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few ways. They have many people talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things.\n\nIn the case of gay marriage, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine. But their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard there are a lot of people starting to have a little bit of a negative view of the Catholic Church because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nYeah, I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong, and that you were going against it. And the same goes with gay marriage and things like that - if that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know if they would have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, I don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God, and they're devoted to their complete life. But I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they're devoted to. So I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nNo.",
            "Personally, I don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think, no matter if you're born that way or not, sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. Like, I was born straight, and another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be responsible for, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this. It's not really a legal issue, and I don't think it's a moral issue either. I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal and judged for their sexual orientation. So I don't think the federal government really has a say in this. \n\nIt's complicated. (laughs) I don't think the federal government should get involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it's not a moral concern, it's not like anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people. That's just how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and they shouldn't be punished for that. No, that's it.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. If it's available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. \n\nYou know, there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percoet. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of these just because there's a taboo around marijuana doesn't make sense to me. We should accept its benefits.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, it can still have negative effects, just like alcohol. But it's a tough one. I say, let's integrate it, let it become legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, not like heroin or cocaine. If we get rid of the image of marijuana as a horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. I think the church is not as strict as it used to be. I know that even though I've grown up, when I was a kid, I always went to church every Sunday. I would wear cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just a part of going to church. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends at church on the weekends. We would just go to church. But as I've gotten older, they've set up a teenager mass, and they've shortened the mass to 30 minutes. People dress more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families running late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at morning mass, I used to always dress up. People are now wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing that I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church. But yeah, that's it. [Okay, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could've been avoided. Because there are married men who still become pedophiles. They still have an attraction to young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. I think there are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [man] he is, but he's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [Okay, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, I was going to say... about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think... like, the whole thing about sexuality being related to genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people can just become pedophiles. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with how they're raised. It might have something to do in some cases, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through marriage. You can try, but it usually comes out. So I don't think the church could've done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, that's shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. [Okay, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "(laughs)\nUm, I initially was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false. And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. Um, I think that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact, even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it. And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I was wondering if I should just talk about it? Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq. I don't keep up with it, I don't know the details, but at this point, I know we're just staying there to try and build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and also to get oil and stuff from them. But that's no reason for staying there because it's making everyone upset. So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say, I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States, that it's going to be even worse for them, and it's going to be like, I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them, and they've been going on this whole like a totalitarian, like a whole dictatorship thing for so long, that you know, I feel like it's going to, that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there, so I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years, hmm, that's about it, okay.",

I think this issue should be decided by the churches because even in the constitution, it is said that church and state should be separated. This is very clear, very clear. If the government tries to exert any power over it, this would be a direct defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution, which is already engraved in stone. So, those who want to make this issue legal I think are choosing one church's belief over another. Just like we see most Catholics, Catholics and Christians are against it and do not support it, except in Boston and some areas. But I don't think this is something that the government should decide what the churches are allowed to make legal and what they are not. This is very strange. Well, the separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, which has guaranteed religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to amend the constitution, I think it's completely wrong to even amend it about this issue, and it's contradictory to what is already stated in the constitution. And I also think it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts people's rights rather than the government's rights. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. I don't think the federal government or any government institution should interfere with this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a bias towards a certain religion over every other religion. So I really think this should be decided by the churches, not the president or anyone in government in particular. And there's no reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to affect the economy or anything else. If anything, it might boost it, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society rather than not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I believe that the government was not completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself am almost against war \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I am against \nUh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in some ways a repeat of Vietnam \nA repeat of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUh \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUh\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I've always supported gay marriage. I've always been. This is a very personal thing, and now more and more research shows that orientation is biological rather than social, so we shouldn't deprive them of their rights due to something they can't control. \n\nIn my opinion, this is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government shouldn't have any role in this; this is not a national issue, it's a personal issue, it's a household issue. In my neighborhood at home, I know there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street just like anyone else. I think Bush is trying to redefine marriage and interpret the words the way he wants. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nActually, research shows that there's a chemical thing in your brain that might make you homosexual. It's not because of environment or social influence, so that's a biological issue, not a social one.\n\nHowever, aside from the obvious, I think another issue is that marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can secretly go to Las Vegas and do it, but if two guys want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal and private affair, rather than a public or national issue.",
            "Uh, when you put something on the internet, it's like a public forum. It's completely public. You can't do anything about it. I mean, as an RA, I've actually dealt with this before. Uh, when you put something out there, it affects how people think of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there; you can't put that out to the whole world. The internet is seen by everyone. If your friend on Myspace gets that bulletin, obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to take action. They can't just let it be because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it. But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that someone overheard someone saying something in school, and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, his friend looked through his Facebook and became very worried because there were some certain things on there that he might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, those things became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't control what they think. You can't control what people take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone who you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different story. Uh, yeah. Like, a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my job, so I don't want that kind of connection. Um, not really.",
            "I feel the war has been dragged out too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nTo restore democracy in another country. \nHowever, I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. \nNow, we are acting only to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think the original motivation was influenced by George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo, if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but not if there were personal interests involved. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. That was a statement in itself. \nHowever, the war has lasted for over a year or even several years, and I think it's just too long. \n\nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country under a tyrant's rule, I think that's a just reason for the war. \nBut I don't think our reason has been misunderstood and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, not to end the war. \nWe don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long, and it should end. \nTheir government officials will have to take care of themselves anyway. \nI think it's time for that. \nWe've drained our economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be spending money on. \nI think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long been extended. \n\nI mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term budget item. \nThere are other things, like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, healthcare, that we have a lot of problems funding, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification on that. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what. Hum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of. Yes.",

            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example. Not really.",
            "I think they didn't completely legalize it, they decriminalized it. You know, it went from a criminal offense to like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that, and then have to come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and have to pay the judge and the state attorney's office has to take on the charge and basically press the charges, and that's a lot of money. So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana, they don't want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. \n\nI think it's important because marijuana isn't something you just want out and about everywhere all over the streets and stuff, there's a whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized are well, if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it's still kind of taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana. To have it out in the open like that would just be awkward to a lot of people. \n\nAnd I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills, I mean, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, they both are bad in their own way, but I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it's hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes because\nThey do a lot of traditional things, like they've been doing the same things for a long time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. Um, many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done, and sometimes the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no, I'm sorry, my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd um, that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's a child, which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. But I think this is the most difficult issue we're facing today, because separating church and state and defining marriage is very tricky. So I don't know, I think all civil unions, I'm not sure how marriage should be viewed. If it's considered a sacred sacrament like religion, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government in any way. So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people in union, no need to separate church and state, no need to ask what kind of marriage it is. Two people got together. So I think gay marriage is just two people in a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states could come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution. It's not big enough of an issue to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. To put it simply.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends, I don't agree with that lifestyle entirely. I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Many states are Democratic, and many are Republican, so Democratic states will naturally support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you will know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you have the right to disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you chose to live there, so you should respect the state's decision. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I have already answered that. I don't think Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it; I don't agree with his ban. I just think that since Bush doesn't live in every single state, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. I think some things should be left to each individual state. He'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I don't agree at all Um Let's see, Myspace is a public thing, a bulletin board You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see Um whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet Um you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that whether it be school officials or not Um so in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes Um but uh yeah with something preventing a school shooting you know as long as it saves the lives of uh students which is a responsibility of the school system I think that's perfectly fine Um let me see here like if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy but Um I feel as though you know as long as they save you know save lives or make the school a better and safer place I don't think that that's an invasion at all Um should I elaborate more on that Yeah um alright well Um like what I was saying it is a public thing Um and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble that's ridiculous Um everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails Um like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know bites you in the butt I guess you could say Um like you know if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow and like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and Um you know if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it you will get in trouble and I don't it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know like I said before and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and Um I don't know let's see here Um like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place Um then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or Um other officials such as the police to go on Um you know when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though you know they're dropping them off at a safe place I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine I went to a public high school and Um they say you know we have to ensure stuff like this because like we would do like lock downs and stuff and Um that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks uh we had to be safe about that we had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because Um that was incase people would come into the building I guess Um so we you know we did practice that stuff Um in order to make the school a safer place and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case they were just making it a safer place Um preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that Um yeah that's basically all I can come up with",
            "Initially, I supported the invasion of Iraq. However, the 9/11 event affected me, and I thought we should go there and create chaos like that. But I think we didn't think about the long-term consequences, and we went there unprepared. I think our actions failed. Now, I am completely against the invasion of Iraq. I think our past actions didn't produce any real effects. I think as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us. I don't think our existence in Iraq will make any difference, because they can't even live in harmony with themselves. Due to the 9/11 event, I've almost lost interest in what's happening in Iraq. I don't care about those people. I just think they're normal in fighting with other countries, but can't get along with themselves. So, I don't care about them. I don't think we can change them. I don't think we can change the system in Iraq. I think we should leave Iraq immediately. I think we invaded Iraq just for revenge. I think President Bush decided to invade Iraq because the people asked him to. I think he made a mistake. I think we should at least know what we're doing. I think we didn't prepare enough for the invasion. I think we didn't establish a unified will. I think we didn't make a thorough plan for our actions. I think we didn't prepare for the future. Therefore, our result is not satisfactory. I think we should leave Iraq, and let the situation stabilize. Therefore, I think we should leave Iraq immediately."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few ways. They have many people talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things.\n\nIn the case of gay marriage, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine. But their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard there are a lot of people starting to have a little bit of a negative view of the Catholic Church because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nYeah, I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong, and that you were going against it. And the same goes with gay marriage and things like that - if that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know if they would have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, I don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God, and they're devoted to their complete life. But I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they're devoted to. So I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nNo.",
            "Personally, I don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think, no matter if you're born that way or not, sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. Like, I was born straight, and another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be responsible for, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this. It's not really a legal issue, and I don't think it's a moral issue either. I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal and judged for their sexual orientation. So I don't think the federal government really has a say in this. \n\nIt's complicated. (laughs) I don't think the federal government should get involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it's not a moral concern, it's not like anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people. That's just how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and they shouldn't be punished for that. No, that's it.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. If it's available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. \n\nYou know, there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percoet. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of these just because there's a taboo around marijuana doesn't make sense to me. We should accept its benefits.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, it can still have negative effects, just like alcohol. But it's a tough one. I say, let's integrate it, let it become legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, not like heroin or cocaine. If we get rid of the image of marijuana as a horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. I think the church is not as strict as it used to be. I know that even though I've grown up, when I was a kid, I always went to church every Sunday. I would wear cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just a part of going to church. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends at church on the weekends. We would just go to church. But as I've gotten older, they've set up a teenager mass, and they've shortened the mass to 30 minutes. People dress more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families running late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at morning mass, I used to always dress up. People are now wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing that I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church. But yeah, that's it. [Okay, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could've been avoided. Because there are married men who still become pedophiles. They still have an attraction to young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. I think there are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [man] he is, but he's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [Okay, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, I was going to say... about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think... like, the whole thing about sexuality being related to genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people can just become pedophiles. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with how they're raised. It might have something to do in some cases, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through marriage. You can try, but it usually comes out. So I don't think the church could've done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, that's shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. [Okay, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "(laughs)\nUm, I initially was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false. And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. Um, I think that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact, even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it. And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I was wondering if I should just talk about it? Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq. I don't keep up with it, I don't know the details, but at this point, I know we're just staying there to try and build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and also to get oil and stuff from them. But that's no reason for staying there because it's making everyone upset. So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say, I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States, that it's going to be even worse for them, and it's going to be like, I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them, and they've been going on this whole like a totalitarian, like a whole dictatorship thing for so long, that you know, I feel like it's going to, that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there, so I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years, hmm, that's about it, okay.",

I think this issue should be decided by the churches because even in the constitution, it is said that church and state should be separated. This is very clear, very clear. If the government tries to exert any power over it, this would be a direct defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution, which is already engraved in stone. So, those who want to make this issue legal I think are choosing one church's belief over another. Just like we see most Catholics, Catholics and Christians are against it and do not support it, except in Boston and some areas. But I don't think this is something that the government should decide what the churches are allowed to make legal and what they are not. This is very strange. Well, the separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, which has guaranteed religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to amend the constitution, I think it's completely wrong to even amend it about this issue, and it's contradictory to what is already stated in the constitution. And I also think it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts people's rights rather than the government's rights. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. I don't think the federal government or any government institution should interfere with this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a bias towards a certain religion over every other religion. So I really think this should be decided by the churches, not the president or anyone in government in particular. And there's no reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to affect the economy or anything else. If anything, it might boost it, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society rather than not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I believe that the government was not completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself am almost against war \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I am against \nUh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in some ways a repeat of Vietnam \nA repeat of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUh \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUh\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I've always supported gay marriage. I've always been. This is a very personal thing, and now more and more research shows that orientation is biological rather than social, so we shouldn't deprive them of their rights due to something they can't control. \n\nIn my opinion, this is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government shouldn't have any role in this; this is not a national issue, it's a personal issue, it's a household issue. In my neighborhood at home, I know there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street just like anyone else. I think Bush is trying to redefine marriage and interpret the words the way he wants. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nActually, research shows that there's a chemical thing in your brain that might make you homosexual. It's not because of environment or social influence, so that's a biological issue, not a social one.\n\nHowever, aside from the obvious, I think another issue is that marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can secretly go to Las Vegas and do it, but if two guys want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal and private affair, rather than a public or national issue.",
            "Uh, when you put something on the internet, it's like a public forum. It's completely public. You can't do anything about it. I mean, as an RA, I've actually dealt with this before. Uh, when you put something out there, it affects how people think of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there; you can't put that out to the whole world. The internet is seen by everyone. If your friend on Myspace gets that bulletin, obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to take action. They can't just let it be because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it. But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that someone overheard someone saying something in school, and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, his friend looked through his Facebook and became very worried because there were some certain things on there that he might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, those things became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't control what they think. You can't control what people take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone who you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different story. Uh, yeah. Like, a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my job, so I don't want that kind of connection. Um, not really.",
            "I feel the war has been dragged out too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nTo restore democracy in another country. \nHowever, I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. \nNow, we are acting only to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think the original motivation was influenced by George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo, if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but not if there were personal interests involved. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. That was a statement in itself. \nHowever, the war has lasted for over a year or even several years, and I think it's just too long. \n\nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country under a tyrant's rule, I think that's a just reason for the war. \nBut I don't think our reason has been misunderstood and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, not to end the war. \nWe don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long, and it should end. \nTheir government officials will have to take care of themselves anyway. \nI think it's time for that. \nWe've drained our economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be spending money on. \nI think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long been extended. \n\nI mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term budget item. \nThere are other things, like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, healthcare, that we have a lot of problems funding, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification on that. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what. Hum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of. Yes.",

            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example. Not really.",
            "I think they didn't completely legalize it, they decriminalized it. You know, it went from a criminal offense to like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that, and then have to come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and have to pay the judge and the state attorney's office has to take on the charge and basically press the charges, and that's a lot of money. So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana, they don't want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. \n\nI think it's important because marijuana isn't something you just want out and about everywhere all over the streets and stuff, there's a whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized are well, if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it's still kind of taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana. To have it out in the open like that would just be awkward to a lot of people. \n\nAnd I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills, I mean, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, they both are bad in their own way, but I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it's hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes because\nThey do a lot of traditional things, like they've been doing the same things for a long time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. Um, many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done, and sometimes the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no, I'm sorry, my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd um, that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's a child, which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. But I think this is the most difficult issue we're facing today, because separating church and state and defining marriage is very tricky. So I don't know, I think all civil unions, I'm not sure how marriage should be viewed. If it's considered a sacred sacrament like religion, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government in any way. So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people in union, no need to separate church and state, no need to ask what kind of marriage it is. Two people got together. So I think gay marriage is just two people in a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states could come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution. It's not big enough of an issue to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. To put it simply.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends, I don't agree with that lifestyle entirely. I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Many states are Democratic, and many are Republican, so Democratic states will naturally support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you will know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you have the right to disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you chose to live there, so you should respect the state's decision. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I have already answered that. I don't think Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it; I don't agree with his ban. I just think that since Bush doesn't live in every single state, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. I think some things should be left to each individual state. He'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I don't agree at all Um Let's see, Myspace is a public thing, a bulletin board You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see Um whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet Um you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that whether it be school officials or not Um so in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes Um but uh yeah with something preventing a school shooting you know as long as it saves the lives of uh students which is a responsibility of the school system I think that's perfectly fine Um let me see here like if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy but Um I feel as though you know as long as they save you know save lives or make the school a better and safer place I don't think that that's an invasion at all Um should I elaborate more on that Yeah um alright well Um like what I was saying it is a public thing Um and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble that's ridiculous Um everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails Um like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know bites you in the butt I guess you could say Um like you know if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow and like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and Um you know if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it you will get in trouble and I don't it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know like I said before and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and Um I don't know let's see here Um like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place Um then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or Um other officials such as the police to go on Um you know when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though you know they're dropping them off at a safe place I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine I went to a public high school and Um they say you know we have to ensure stuff like this because like we would do like lock downs and stuff and Um that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks uh we had to be safe about that we had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because Um that was incase people would come into the building I guess Um so we you know we did practice that stuff Um in order to make the school a safer place and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case they were just making it a safer place Um preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that Um yeah that's basically all I can come up with",
            "Initially, I supported the invasion of Iraq. However, the 9/11 event affected me, and I thought we should go there and create chaos like that. But I think we didn't think about the long-term consequences, and we went there unprepared. I think our actions failed. Now, I am completely against the invasion of Iraq. I think our past actions didn't produce any real effects. I think as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us. I don't think our existence in Iraq will make any difference, because they can't even live in harmony with themselves. Due to the 9/11 event, I've almost lost interest in what's happening in Iraq. I don't care about those people. I just think they're normal in fighting with other countries, but can't get along with themselves. So, I don't care about them. I don't think we can change them. I don't think we can change the system in Iraq. I think we should leave Iraq immediately. I think we invaded Iraq just for revenge. I think President Bush decided to invade Iraq because the people asked him to. I think he made a mistake. I think we should at least know what we're doing. I think we didn't prepare enough for the invasion. I think we didn't establish a unified will. I think we didn't make a thorough plan for our actions. I think we didn't prepare for the future. Therefore, our result is not satisfactory. I think we should leave Iraq, and let the situation stabilize. Therefore, I think we should leave Iraq immediately."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to make some changes in a few ways. They have many people talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things.\n\nIn the case of gay marriage, in the case of abortion, in the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them, which is fine. But their views are a little old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to a newer style of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers.\n\nI've heard there are a lot of people starting to have a little bit of a negative view of the Catholic Church because of the way they see these situations, and people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things.\n\nYeah, I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong, and that you were going against it. And the same goes with gay marriage and things like that - if that's something you believe in and want to do or even just feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following that doesn't agree with that.\n\nI don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would necessarily have prevented what happened. I mean, I don't know if they would have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don't know if that would have necessarily changed it.\n\nWell, I mean, that was something they did, and that was something that didn't really seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married, would they have done it differently? It's hard to really tell.\n\nYeah, I don't see why priests can't be married. I mean, the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God, and they're devoted to their complete life. But I don't see why everyone else who has a job in the world has their job, then they also have their family life, and the other people they're devoted to. So I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nNo.",
            "Personally, I don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think, no matter if you're born that way or not, sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think that people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem like it's a choice they make. Like, I was born straight, and another person is born gay. It doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice they should be responsible for, if you know what I mean.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this. It's not really a legal issue, and I don't think it's a moral issue either. I don't think gay people should be put on a pedestal and judged for their sexual orientation. So I don't think the federal government really has a say in this. \n\nIt's complicated. (laughs) I don't think the federal government should get involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it's not a moral concern, it's not like anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have the right to interfere in people's lives. And that's just who they are - gay people. That's just how they were born, or at least that's what I think, and they shouldn't be punished for that. No, that's it.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's no good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different and there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two sides of the same coin; heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family. I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on, \"oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. People worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about kids of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well again, it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how kids get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for kids of gay parents because in public schools in New York City they get beaten up and stuff like that. And parents protest to get the kid removed from their school. And it's just a kid, I mean they'll have the same viewpoints and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. So they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to. I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views on his own having to do with his religion. Well his take on gay marriage actually um I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable but it definitely differs from person to person and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy considering I mean about under God in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um just one lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. If it's available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. \n\nYou know, there are many illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percoet. They're controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. Denying the benefits of these just because there's a taboo around marijuana doesn't make sense to me. We should accept its benefits.\n\nI don't think it's comparable to alcohol, because if you abuse marijuana, it can still have negative effects, just like alcohol. But it's a tough one. I say, let's integrate it, let it become legal gradually, not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, not like heroin or cocaine. If we get rid of the image of marijuana as a horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the 21st century. I think the church is not as strict as it used to be. I know that even though I've grown up, when I was a kid, I always went to church every Sunday. I would wear cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was just a part of going to church. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends at church on the weekends. We would just go to church. But as I've gotten older, they've set up a teenager mass, and they've shortened the mass to 30 minutes. People dress more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families running late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at morning mass, I used to always dress up. People are now wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too. But it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing that I've noticed. That's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church. But yeah, that's it. [Okay, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could've been avoided. Because there are married men who still become pedophiles. They still have an attraction to young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person; it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. I think there are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh Heaven. I don't know what kind of [man] he is, but he's a reverend or a minister or something. [Mm hmm] But they're allowed to get married. So I know it's a little different. But if they really wanted to practice their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. [Okay, can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, I was going to say... about the changes. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about pedophilia. [Mm hmm] I think... like, the whole thing about sexuality being related to genetics. I think it's based on genetics. I don't think people can just become pedophiles. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with how they're raised. It might have something to do in some cases, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through marriage. You can try, but it usually comes out. So I don't think the church could've done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, that's shameful. But I don't think in all cases they knew. [Okay, do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] No",
            "(laughs)\nUm, I initially was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq. I think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false. And that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood. Um, I think that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact, even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it. And, to me that’s just malfeasance in office, I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since, well since September 11th at least, I mean. I think that they, um, they came into office with the intent to go to war. Um, that last part, I forget the name of the, um, Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office, um, but it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also very underhanded way to do things. Well, I do think it’s gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result, um, I think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order, but I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because, um, Iraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. Just from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um, oh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. Um, (laughs) none that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I was wondering if I should just talk about it? Okay, cool. Um, I'm sorry. Okay. Let's talk about the war in Iraq. Let me think. At this point, I feel it's kind of pointless because it's not even a declared war, actually. I feel like it was just a big revenge against Iraq because that's who we thought bombed the U.S. on 9/11. Like, who did the terrorist attacks? So I don't feel like I'm a big supporter of the War in Iraq. I don't keep up with it, I don't know the details, but at this point, I know we're just staying there to try and build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and also to get oil and stuff from them. But that's no reason for staying there because it's making everyone upset. So, and then like, if we stay there, then what's gonna happen is we have to try and create democracy, which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. Um, let me see. Oh, this is so hard. This is the one topic I don't know anything about. Um, war in Iraq. Oh, this is hard. Uh, I don't know. Do you have anything else I can go off of? Okay, thank you. Um, well, actually I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that's fair, you know, I think the only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, we're big and American and stuff like that, and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by Congress, then it's, I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually, no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now, I feel so bad for Bush because it's like, it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like, remember, I think with the whole Vietnam thing, the Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called a meaningless war, and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever, that he started this meaningless war and stuff, so. You have to make this a half an hour don't you? Uh, okay, yeah, um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is, like, it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like, I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know, you want them to like, these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took, I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again, it's like, it's hard to say, I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States, that it's going to be even worse for them, and it's going to be like, I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them, and they've been going on this whole like a totalitarian, like a whole dictatorship thing for so long, that you know, I feel like it's going to, that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there, so I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years, hmm, that's about it, okay.",

I think this issue should be decided by the churches because even in the constitution, it is said that church and state should be separated. This is very clear, very clear. If the government tries to exert any power over it, this would be a direct defiance of what has already been said and written in the constitution, which is already engraved in stone. So, those who want to make this issue legal I think are choosing one church's belief over another. Just like we see most Catholics, Catholics and Christians are against it and do not support it, except in Boston and some areas. But I don't think this is something that the government should decide what the churches are allowed to make legal and what they are not. This is very strange. Well, the separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, which has guaranteed religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to amend the constitution, I think it's completely wrong to even amend it about this issue, and it's contradictory to what is already stated in the constitution. And I also think it would be one of the only amendments that actually restricts people's rights rather than the government's rights. So I don't think that's right at all in that aspect. I don't think the federal government or any government institution should interfere with this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a bias towards a certain religion over every other religion. So I really think this should be decided by the churches, not the president or anyone in government in particular. And there's no reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to affect the economy or anything else. If anything, it might boost it, I don't know how, but I think it might have a better impact on the society rather than not. Umm, not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I believe that the government was not completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUh \nI \nI myself am almost against war \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I am against \nUh \nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is in some ways a repeat of Vietnam \nA repeat of the war in Vietnam and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \nI mean a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the country's government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUh \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and it’s kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUh \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUh \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared themselves but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUh \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUh \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUh \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbandon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUh\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I've always supported gay marriage. I've always been. This is a very personal thing, and now more and more research shows that orientation is biological rather than social, so we shouldn't deprive them of their rights due to something they can't control. \n\nIn my opinion, this is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and government shouldn't have any role in this; this is not a national issue, it's a personal issue, it's a household issue. In my neighborhood at home, I know there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they're not allowed to. But they function the same way any other family would. They walk the dogs down the street just like anyone else. I think Bush is trying to redefine marriage and interpret the words the way he wants. I think it's ridiculous.\n\nActually, research shows that there's a chemical thing in your brain that might make you homosexual. It's not because of environment or social influence, so that's a biological issue, not a social one.\n\nHowever, aside from the obvious, I think another issue is that marriage is something that if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can secretly go to Las Vegas and do it, but if two guys want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times. I think it should be a personal and private affair, rather than a public or national issue.",
            "Uh, when you put something on the internet, it's like a public forum. It's completely public. You can't do anything about it. I mean, as an RA, I've actually dealt with this before. Uh, when you put something out there, it affects how people think of you. If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's going to say something. You can't put that out there; you can't put that out to the whole world. The internet is seen by everyone. If your friend on Myspace gets that bulletin, obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin. Someone went to the school, and they have to take action. They can't just let it be because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it. But again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that. I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school. It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. Sorry, I couldn't remember the word for a minute. And it could also be something very serious. I think. What happened here was that someone overheard someone saying something in school, and then they reported it. When we finally found out who the person was, his friend looked through his Facebook and became very worried because there were some certain things on there that he might have meant as a joke. But in light of the situation, those things became very serious. When you put something out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't control what they think. You can't control what people take seriously or not. I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone who you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's a different story. Uh, yeah. Like, a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up, and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my job, so I don't want that kind of connection. Um, not really.",
            "I feel the war has been dragged out too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nTo restore democracy in another country. \nHowever, I think we've long since lost sight of that purpose. \nNow, we are acting only to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think the original motivation was influenced by George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo, if the original purpose was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be a fair motivation, but not if there were personal interests involved. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months, just by starting the war. That was a statement in itself. \nHowever, the war has lasted for over a year or even several years, and I think it's just too long. \n\nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country under a tyrant's rule, I think that's a just reason for the war. \nBut I don't think our reason has been misunderstood and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, not to end the war. \nWe don't want to end the war without a decisive victory. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long, and it should end. \nTheir government officials will have to take care of themselves anyway. \nI think it's time for that. \nWe've drained our economy, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be spending money on. \nI think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long been extended. \n\nI mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be a long-term budget item. \nThere are other things, like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, healthcare, that we have a lot of problems funding, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification on that. It was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like... Oh, okay, um, no, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. On sites such as Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know, you have to have another member to see someone's profile, you might need to be their friend or something like that. But if that's the case, you've already accepted that person as your friend so they can see it; you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hum, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles for all the students in the school to prevent that from happening, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Oh, let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\" Um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something? So, I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like, I mean, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook. I do, it bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me. And I saw something on TV once that was about this man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily. He went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like under a minute and got her to meet with him. And I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you post your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they basically know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean, you never know really, who can look at what. Hum, um, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have Myspace. And I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people. That's the only other thought I could think of. Yes.",

            "I think that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just women who face this problem, I think it's related to the specific field you're working in. I think women face more difficulties because even though there's supposed to be equality, many people still have a hard time accepting a woman as a leader. This is mainly due to societal habits. In the workplace, women may see a job that suits them and has all the qualifications, but the board will refuse to promote them to that position because historically, women are not seen as leaders in the business world. The same goes for men, especially in the fashion industry or taking care of the family at home. It's really uncommon for men to stay at home and take care of the children, and people look down on them because society thinks that men should be working to make a living, not staying at home. It's hard for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children, especially if their wives have better jobs and they're doing well. In the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously because they think it's not masculine to be interested in fashion. I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because people think men and fashion don't go well together. So if a man is in the fashion industry, people will think, \"How do I know if you really know about fashion if you're a man?\" Like, they don't really know what our case is like, like other guys. Depending on the field of work you're in, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. It's hard to change because society has a set mindset, and we've made a lot of progress, but it's slow. I think if we continue at the pace we are now, and women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process, but it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. And similarly, as men become stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because people realize, \"Oh, maybe the woman does have the better job, or she wants to be the one working.\" And for fashion, people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or their wives, and they do know where I'm coming from.\" So I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are stereotyped against without being too pushy, because if you force it, people will resist. And I think we're at a good balance where it's starting to be enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast, people will resist and we've made a lot of progress, and change takes time. Yes. And I guess people are also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you're from, like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and you work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world, or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"How do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So yeah, sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you, and like from gender to gender, and I don't know, I guess that's another example. Not really.",
            "I think they didn't completely legalize it, they decriminalized it. You know, it went from a criminal offense to like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that, and then have to come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and have to pay the judge and the state attorney's office has to take on the charge and basically press the charges, and that's a lot of money. So, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, they're not willing to make that kind of concession even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully against marijuana, they don't want to do that, but in a place like Denver where people tend to be more open-minded, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. \n\nI think it's important because marijuana isn't something you just want out and about everywhere all over the streets and stuff, there's a whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized are well, if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it's still kind of taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts to smoke marijuana. To have it out in the open like that would just be awkward to a lot of people. \n\nAnd I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana has a more adverse effect on people's lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills, I mean, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, they both are bad in their own way, but I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it's hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes because\nThey do a lot of traditional things, like they've been doing the same things for a long time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. Um, many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done, and sometimes the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics, and they don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was Episcopalian, no, I'm sorry, my dad was Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nAnd um, that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nUm, I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean, I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, um, it might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nUm, well, I guess, like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it's a child, which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like, I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. But I think this is the most difficult issue we're facing today, because separating church and state and defining marriage is very tricky. So I don't know, I think all civil unions, I'm not sure how marriage should be viewed. If it's considered a sacred sacrament like religion, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government in any way. So if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people in union, no need to separate church and state, no need to ask what kind of marriage it is. Two people got together. So I think gay marriage is just two people in a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states could come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not something that should be amended to the constitution. It's not big enough of an issue to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. To put it simply.\n\nNo",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so the topic of homosexuality is somewhat of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends, I don't agree with that lifestyle entirely. I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president deciding for the entire country. Many states are Democratic, and many are Republican, so Democratic states will naturally support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you will know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you have the right to disagree with the decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you chose to live there, so you should respect the state's decision. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I have already answered that. I don't think Bush should decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it; I don't agree with his ban. I just think that since Bush doesn't live in every single state, he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. I think some things should be left to each individual state. He'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I don't agree at all Um Let's see, Myspace is a public thing, a bulletin board You know, if you look at that definition, then you know, that's basically to post for the public to see or for others to see Um whatever you're trying to get at, and now if you post that on the internet Um you know, you have to realize that people will be seeing that whether it be school officials or not Um so in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that they had every right to see it because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes Um but uh yeah with something preventing a school shooting you know as long as it saves the lives of uh students which is a responsibility of the school system I think that's perfectly fine Um let me see here like if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they're not supposed to be doing they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy but Um I feel as though you know as long as they save you know save lives or make the school a better and safer place I don't think that that's an invasion at all Um should I elaborate more on that Yeah um alright well Um like what I was saying it is a public thing Um and with a student posting something on Myspace and not expecting to get in trouble that's ridiculous Um everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails Um like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up and you know everything like everything nowadays comes back and you know bites you in the butt I guess you could say Um like you know if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow and like once it's on the internet it's always on the internet and Um you know if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it you will get in trouble and I don't it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy because you know like I said before and well that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing and Um I don't know let's see here Um like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place Um then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them or Um other officials such as the police to go on Um you know when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though you know they're dropping them off at a safe place I've actually discussed that with a teacher of mine I went to a public high school and Um they say you know we have to ensure stuff like this because like we would do like lock downs and stuff and Um that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks uh we had to be safe about that we had like drill stuff and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the well I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting because Um that was incase people would come into the building I guess Um so we you know we did practice that stuff Um in order to make the school a safer place and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case they were just making it a safer place Um preventing anything bad from happening like Columbine or something like that Um yeah that's basically all I can come up with",
            "Initially, I supported the invasion of Iraq. However, the 9/11 event affected me, and I thought we should go there and create chaos like that. But I think we didn't think about the long-term consequences, and we went there unprepared. I think our actions failed. Now, I am completely against the invasion of Iraq. I think our past actions didn't produce any real effects. I think as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us. I don't think our existence in Iraq will make any difference, because they can't even live in harmony with themselves. Due to the 9/11 event, I've almost lost interest in what's happening in Iraq. I don't care about those people. I just think they're normal in fighting with other countries, but can't get along with themselves. So, I don't care about them. I don't think we can change them. I don't think we can change the system in Iraq. I think we should leave Iraq immediately. I think we invaded Iraq just for revenge. I think President Bush decided to invade Iraq because the people asked him to. I think he made a mistake. I think we should at least know what we're doing. I think we didn't prepare enough for the invasion. I think we didn't establish a unified will. I think we didn't make a thorough plan for our actions. I think we didn't prepare for the future. Therefore, our result is not satisfactory. I think we should leave Iraq, and let the situation stabilize. Therefore, I think we should leave Iraq immediately."
