            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think people's sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think gay people shouldn't be blamed for their sexual orientation. I think it's unfair. Because they don't choose their sexual orientation. I think sexual orientation isn't an option. People can't choose whether they're gay or straight. I'm straight, another person is gay, that's how they're born. I think it's not a conscious choice. So I think they shouldn't be blamed. I think the government shouldn't interfere with this issue because it's not a legal issue. It's not a moral issue either. I don't think it's a national security issue. The government shouldn't interfere with personal matters. Everyone should have the right to choose their own life. Gay people should be treated with dignity and respect.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's completely different. Gay marriage has many aspects, and it can't be compared to heterosexual marriage. It's like two sides of the same coin - it will never be the other side. However, it's still the same thing. Gay couples have a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where their partner can't be in the room with them if they're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and gay couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people, like Catholics, can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that kind of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners, and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples, and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new, and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers, and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view, and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so, they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion, and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical, to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the morality of others is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under god in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects, instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making the drug available to the public, I would say no. Absolutely not. However, for medical purposes, I would say yes. Because, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It doesn't have benefits, you know what I mean. \n\nYes, I mean that there are many drugs that are illegal that are used in pharmacies. Like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet – those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, that's just not right. You should accept its benefits, I think. \n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if abused, can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol, it can also lead to bad things. It's a tough call. I'd say not. You could integrate it gradually, like make it legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused but if you just had to remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. \n\nUh, yes, I mean people have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we got rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes. No",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was every weekend I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there. And we would just go. But now as I've gotten older, they've made the mass for teenagers. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. You'd see the families running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also, when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. I don't know what kind of minister or reverend he is, but they allow them to get married. So I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, which part? About... [Um] Just the changing ways. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about the pedophilia. [Mm hmm.] Um, I think, like, the whole... [Um] Sexuality is before about being genetic. I think it's genetic. I don't think people just become that way. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] Um, no.",
            "I was initially okay with the premise of the Iraq war, but I think that the repercussions of the 9/11 attacks were still very much lingering, and we went to war in Iraq under a pretext, with many indications that we had already been moving towards Iraq. I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government. And I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I want to say something.\nMmhmm\nJust say anything?\nOkay\nOkay, that's cool\nUmum\nI'm sorry\nOkay\nLet's talk about how I feel about the Iraq War.\nLet me think\nAt this point, I think it's pointless because it wasn't even declared a war.\nI think it's just to get back at Iraq because we think they did the 9/11 attack.\nSo I don't think it's a reason for anything.\nI mean, I'm not a big person on the War in Iraq.\nSo I don't really keep up with it.\nI don't know the details of it.\nBut I do know that we're staying there to try to build a democracy, so it can become like another U.S. thing.\nAnd also to get oil and resources from them.\nBut that's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone mad.\nSo if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try to build a democracy, which takes forever because you can't build a democracy in just a day.\nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.\nUm let me think\nThis is a really hard topic\nThis is one topic I don't know anything about\nUm Iraq War\nOh this is hard\nUh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay thanks\nUm Well actually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think\nYou know\nThe only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it was never declared a war by Congress\nI think that's how it works\nYou have to declare a war by Congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOkay",
            "Uh\nI really don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. \nI believe it's entirely up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that it's right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "The Iraq War\nOkay\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nStarting from the beginning, I think the US government did not completely honestly tell the American people the reasons for invading Iraq\nBefore invading Iraq, I thought\nI thought they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks\nHowever, they were not really related to each other\nBut the government made it seem that way, and utilized the outrage of the American people over the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq, which started in 2003\nOkay\nI\nI myself and pretty much everyone else are against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against it\nOkay\nI think the Iraq War is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War\nThe US government should learn from past mistakes\nI think\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died\n\nThis is horrible\nWhat they were\nWhat they were doing was\nThey were removing the country's government\nI really don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur\nOkay\nAnd the US government\nAnd the US government removed the Iraqi government\nThey are trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq\nThis is similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd to implement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nBecause\nBecause\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country\nSpecific citizens in the country\nSo\nSo I think\nI think the government\nSo I think the government\nIf you're going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government\nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there's still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that\nThat the US government wasn't prepared, in a way, tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a\nA short, successful invasion of Iraq\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda\nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was a lot of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nThat's\nNo that's\nNo that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started and\nAnd so I mean once you're in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them\nAbandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we get our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference and uh, and it's been proven more and more now that it could be biological, as opposed to sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control. Um, because they can't control it. I think it's inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any reason for politics and government to have any part in this. It's not even on a state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. You know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way any other family would, you know, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that, uh, Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way that he wants to, I think it's ridiculous.\n\nCertainly, yes, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different, uh, publications and TV reports or newspapers, whatever, on that, it's something now that's been proven to be a chemical thing in your brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual. As opposed to, uh, growing up and you know, maybe with like four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side, opposed to sociological.\n\nUm, well, other than that, I guess the obvious reason is that, uh, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person just go to, uh, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of, uh, the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, uh, sector-type thing, opposed to, uh, public domain and, uh, national, uh, federal domain.\n\nUh, no, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, that's a different story altogether. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and partying and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I'd have to take action. That's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Not really.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nBut I think we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. \nNow we might just be doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think maybe the original motive was already questionable, related to George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo I think \nIf the original motivation was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a fair motivation if there weren't any personal interests involved. I don't think it would be fair if there were personal interests. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months of the war; that was a statement in itself. \nBut the fact that it's been going on for over a year or several years, I think it's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I think \nI mean, if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think \nI think our reason has become distorted and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYeah, I do think it's been going on long enough, and it should stop. \nI mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. \nAnd I think that time has come. \nWe've been spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems at home, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously other things we need to fund, such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads, anything dealing with schools, healthcare. \nWe certainly have a lot of problems to fund those things, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money's being spent to kill some of our own citizens in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",

I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't want to join the bandwagon of people who are like, 'I was against it from the beginning.' Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore. Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean, no, like 75 to 80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. 80% of Iraqis, um, 70% of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should withdraw within the year. Um, I don't know. It's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster. And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy. I don't think anyone's arguing that he's not. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll I mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

            "I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender. I don't know, I guess that's another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because their many things are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I think this is one of the most complicated issues we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are very delicate issues. And it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone. So, I don't know what I'm thinking. I think all civil unions are... I don't know if marriage should be looked at as defined by the government because it's considered a sacrament, so people get tax breaks or looked at in a certain way by the government if they were baptized. And if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is - two people. They shouldn't have the separation of church and state, and they shouldn't care about what kind of marriage it was - two people got united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people who got a civil union. Um, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's something that the constitution shouldn't be amended for just because it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage, simply put. Uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be decided by each state rather than the president. Many states are democratic and many are republican. Obviously, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you naturally know how that state feels about that issue. And if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you have the right to disagree with that decision because you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that. But I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in about two years. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should be up to each state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "Um, I don't completely agree. I think it's like this. Let's see. I'm trying to figure it out. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know it's basically for the public or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I feel like school officials seeing that, they have every right to see it. Because even if they weren't posting it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system. I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on the internet like on MySpace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel like, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, um, alright, well, um, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing a lot longer. But, um, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email, because I'm afraid someone will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and um, you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\nUm, like I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and um, they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lockdowns, and stuff, and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drills and stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because um, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Well \nUh, \nThe war \nUh, \nAt first, I supported the invasion because I was personally affected by 9/11 \nUh, \nI thought we should do the same thing here, create as much chaos as they did here \nUh, \nI think because 9/11 was an emotional thing, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences \nWe went there unprepared, no plan, \nUh, \nI think it backfired on us \nUh, \nI don't know \nI was all for it then, but now I'm completely against it \nI don't think it achieved anything \nUh, \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us \nLike, I don't think our being there will make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves \nSo uh, \nBecause of 9/11, I'm almost apathetic about what's going on over there \nUh, \nWith those people, I just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think they're human \nI don't know \nThey're just fighting with each other and can't do anything \nUh, \nI really don't care \nUh, \nI don't know \nWe went over there completely unprepared, without any idea of what we'd face \nUh, \nIt's also bad because war is very different for them than it is for us \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're trying to improve their country \nI just think they want us to leave \nAnd I think that's fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that's it \nUh, \nI think we were just hyped up, not thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nUh, \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd uh, \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUh, \nBut at the time, I understood where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it \nSo \nUh, \nI don't think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order \nAnd I don't know \nI just think that they didn't \nThere was no unity \nThey didn't know what they were going into \nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that's what we created in turn in there \nUh, \nHonestly, I don't \nI don't think we're the ones to change those people \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that \nAnd uh, \nI don't \nI really don't have anything else to say \nIt's gone on for too long \nUh, \nI don't think we're making enough progress \nWe've made some progress, but not enough to stay there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there \nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse \nAnd we can't stay over there forever \nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nWell"

you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think people's sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think gay people shouldn't be blamed for their sexual orientation. I think it's unfair. Because they don't choose their sexual orientation. I think sexual orientation isn't an option. People can't choose whether they're gay or straight. I'm straight, another person is gay, that's how they're born. I think it's not a conscious choice. So I think they shouldn't be blamed. I think the government shouldn't interfere with this issue because it's not a legal issue. It's not a moral issue either. I don't think it's a national security issue. The government shouldn't interfere with personal matters. Everyone should have the right to choose their own life. Gay people should be treated with dignity and respect.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's completely different. Gay marriage has many aspects, and it can't be compared to heterosexual marriage. It's like two sides of the same coin - it will never be the other side. However, it's still the same thing. Gay couples have a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where their partner can't be in the room with them if they're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and gay couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people, like Catholics, can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that kind of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners, and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples, and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new, and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers, and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view, and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so, they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion, and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical, to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the morality of others is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under god in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects, instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making the drug available to the public, I would say no. Absolutely not. However, for medical purposes, I would say yes. Because, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It doesn't have benefits, you know what I mean. \n\nYes, I mean that there are many drugs that are illegal that are used in pharmacies. Like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet – those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, that's just not right. You should accept its benefits, I think. \n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if abused, can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol, it can also lead to bad things. It's a tough call. I'd say not. You could integrate it gradually, like make it legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused but if you just had to remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. \n\nUh, yes, I mean people have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we got rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes. No",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was every weekend I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there. And we would just go. But now as I've gotten older, they've made the mass for teenagers. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. You'd see the families running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also, when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. I don't know what kind of minister or reverend he is, but they allow them to get married. So I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, which part? About... [Um] Just the changing ways. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about the pedophilia. [Mm hmm.] Um, I think, like, the whole... [Um] Sexuality is before about being genetic. I think it's genetic. I don't think people just become that way. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] Um, no.",
            "I was initially okay with the premise of the Iraq war, but I think that the repercussions of the 9/11 attacks were still very much lingering, and we went to war in Iraq under a pretext, with many indications that we had already been moving towards Iraq. I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.

            "Uh\nI really don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. \nI believe it's entirely up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that it's right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "The Iraq War\nOkay\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nStarting from the beginning, I think the US government did not completely honestly tell the American people the reasons for invading Iraq\nBefore invading Iraq, I thought\nI thought they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks\nHowever, they were not really related to each other\nBut the government made it seem that way, and utilized the outrage of the American people over the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq, which started in 2003\nOkay\nI\nI myself and pretty much everyone else are against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against it\nOkay\nI think the Iraq War is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War\nThe US government should learn from past mistakes\nI think\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died\n\nThis is horrible\nWhat they were\nWhat they were doing was\nThey were removing the country's government\nI really don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur\nOkay\nAnd the US government\nAnd the US government removed the Iraqi government\nThey are trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq\nThis is similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd to implement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nBecause\nBecause\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country\nSpecific citizens in the country\nSo\nSo I think\nI think the government\nSo I think the government\nIf you're going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government\nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there's still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that\nThat the US government wasn't prepared, in a way, tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a\nA short, successful invasion of Iraq\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda\nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was a lot of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nThat's\nNo that's\nNo that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started and\nAnd so I mean once you're in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them\nAbandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we get our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference and uh, and it's been proven more and more now that it could be biological, as opposed to sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control. Um, because they can't control it. I think it's inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any reason for politics and government to have any part in this. It's not even on a state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. You know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way any other family would, you know, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that, uh, Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way that he wants to, I think it's ridiculous.\n\nCertainly, yes, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different, uh, publications and TV reports or newspapers, whatever, on that, it's something now that's been proven to be a chemical thing in your brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual. As opposed to, uh, growing up and you know, maybe with like four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side, opposed to sociological.\n\nUm, well, other than that, I guess the obvious reason is that, uh, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person just go to, uh, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of, uh, the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, uh, sector-type thing, opposed to, uh, public domain and, uh, national, uh, federal domain.\n\nUh, no, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, that's a different story altogether. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and partying and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I'd have to take action. That's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Not really.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nBut I think we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. \nNow we might just be doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think maybe the original motive was already questionable, related to George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo I think \nIf the original motivation was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a fair motivation if there weren't any personal interests involved. I don't think it would be fair if there were personal interests. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months of the war; that was a statement in itself. \nBut the fact that it's been going on for over a year or several years, I think it's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I think \nI mean, if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think \nI think our reason has become distorted and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYeah, I do think it's been going on long enough, and it should stop. \nI mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. \nAnd I think that time has come. \nWe've been spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems at home, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously other things we need to fund, such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads, anything dealing with schools, healthcare. \nWe certainly have a lot of problems to fund those things, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money's being spent to kill some of our own citizens in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",

I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't want to join the bandwagon of people who are like, 'I was against it from the beginning.' Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore. Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean, no, like 75 to 80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. 80% of Iraqis, um, 70% of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should withdraw within the year. Um, I don't know. It's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster. And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy. I don't think anyone's arguing that he's not. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll I mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

            "I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender. I don't know, I guess that's another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because their many things are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I think this is one of the most complicated issues we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are very delicate issues. And it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone. So, I don't know what I'm thinking. I think all civil unions are... I don't know if marriage should be looked at as defined by the government because it's considered a sacrament, so people get tax breaks or looked at in a certain way by the government if they were baptized. And if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is - two people. They shouldn't have the separation of church and state, and they shouldn't care about what kind of marriage it was - two people got united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people who got a civil union. Um, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's something that the constitution shouldn't be amended for just because it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage, simply put. Uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be decided by each state rather than the president. Many states are democratic and many are republican. Obviously, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you naturally know how that state feels about that issue. And if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you have the right to disagree with that decision because you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that. But I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in about two years. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should be up to each state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "Um, I don't completely agree. I think it's like this. Let's see. I'm trying to figure it out. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know it's basically for the public or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I feel like school officials seeing that, they have every right to see it. Because even if they weren't posting it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system. I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on the internet like on MySpace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel like, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, um, alright, well, um, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing a lot longer. But, um, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email, because I'm afraid someone will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and um, you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\nUm, like I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and um, they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lockdowns, and stuff, and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drills and stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because um, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Well \nUh, \nThe war \nUh, \nAt first, I supported the invasion because I was personally affected by 9/11 \nUh, \nI thought we should do the same thing here, create as much chaos as they did here \nUh, \nI think because 9/11 was an emotional thing, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences \nWe went there unprepared, no plan, \nUh, \nI think it backfired on us \nUh, \nI don't know \nI was all for it then, but now I'm completely against it \nI don't think it achieved anything \nUh, \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us \nLike, I don't think our being there will make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves \nSo uh, \nBecause of 9/11, I'm almost apathetic about what's going on over there \nUh, \nWith those people, I just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think they're human \nI don't know \nThey're just fighting with each other and can't do anything \nUh, \nI really don't care \nUh, \nI don't know \nWe went over there completely unprepared, without any idea of what we'd face \nUh, \nIt's also bad because war is very different for them than it is for us \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're trying to improve their country \nI just think they want us to leave \nAnd I think that's fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that's it \nUh, \nI think we were just hyped up, not thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nUh, \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd uh, \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUh, \nBut at the time, I understood where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it \nSo \nUh, \nI don't think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order \nAnd I don't know \nI just think that they didn't \nThere was no unity \nThey didn't know what they were going into \nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that's what we created in turn in there \nUh, \nHonestly, I don't \nI don't think we're the ones to change those people \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that \nAnd uh, \nI don't \nI really don't have anything else to say \nIt's gone on for too long \nUh, \nI don't think we're making enough progress \nWe've made some progress, but not enough to stay there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there \nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse \nAnd we can't stay over there forever \nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nWell"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strong views which are fine but a bit outdated. They have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things. For example, gay marriages, abortion, birth control, etc. They have a very strong viewpoint on these things which is understandable. But the problem is if they were to adapt to a bit of a newer way of thinking they wouldn't be worried about losing followers. Some people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because they see their stance on these issues as old-fashioned and so some people are starting to disagree with them on certain subjects. They feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong view on things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not be comfortable following a church that teaches it's completely wrong and that you're against it. The same goes for gay marriage, etc. If you believe in it and want to do it or feel strongly about it, you might not want to be in a church that doesn't agree with that. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married. But I don't know if that would have prevented what happened. I don't know if they would have done things differently if they were allowed to be married or have women priests. But I don't know if that would have changed things. They did what they did and that didn't seem to be affected. I mean, if they were married would they have done things differently? It's hard to really tell. I don't see why priests can't be married, the Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devote their whole life to God, but everyone else who has a job in the world has their job and also has their family life and other people they're devoted to, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't oppose same-sex marriage. I think people's sexual orientation isn't a conscious choice. So I think gay people shouldn't be blamed for their sexual orientation. I think it's unfair. Because they don't choose their sexual orientation. I think sexual orientation isn't an option. People can't choose whether they're gay or straight. I'm straight, another person is gay, that's how they're born. I think it's not a conscious choice. So I think they shouldn't be blamed. I think the government shouldn't interfere with this issue because it's not a legal issue. It's not a moral issue either. I don't think it's a national security issue. The government shouldn't interfere with personal matters. Everyone should have the right to choose their own life. Gay people should be treated with dignity and respect.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because there's not really a good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's completely different. Gay marriage has many aspects, and it can't be compared to heterosexual marriage. It's like two sides of the same coin - it will never be the other side. However, it's still the same thing. Gay couples have a lot of civil rights that come with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing, where their partner can't be in the room with them if they're sick, and can't visit because they're not technically family. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and gay couples have the same kind of success rates as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that gay people aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand how people, like Catholics, can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, and that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that kind of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners, and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues, and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples, and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parent's sexual orientation choices or not. But well, again, it's kind of new, and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption, because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers, and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City, they get like beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view, and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so, they can be community involved or not, like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well, I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. His take on gay marriage actually, um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion, and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons, I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical, to just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the morality of others is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about, um, under god in the pledge of allegiance, and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to, um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects, instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends, and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently. Nope.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making the drug available to the public, I would say no. Absolutely not. However, for medical purposes, I would say yes. Because, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It doesn't have benefits, you know what I mean. \n\nYes, I mean that there are many drugs that are illegal that are used in pharmacies. Like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet – those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, that's just not right. You should accept its benefits, I think. \n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol because marijuana, if abused, can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol, it can also lead to bad things. It's a tough call. I'd say not. You could integrate it gradually, like make it legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused but if you just had to remove the taboo around marijuana first and then people might use it responsibly. \n\nUh, yes, I mean people have a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But, I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we got rid of the image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, people might be able to use it responsibly and certainly for medical purposes. No",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the 21st century. \nI know even as I've grown up, when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday. And I would get cute little dresses, and matching shoes, and a matching purse. That was every weekend I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there. And we would just go. But now as I've gotten older, they've made the mass for teenagers. And they cut it down to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually. Especially in the summer, people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach. You'd see the families running in late. So I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up, people are wearing jeans and khakis. Well, khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual compared to that. As for other things, that's the biggest thing I noticed. Like, that's the church I know. I don't know the politics within the church and whatnot. But yeah, that's it. [Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?] I don't think these things could have been avoided. Because there are men who are married, and they still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. So I think even if you got them married, it's just the person, it's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married. I think also, when they're becoming a priest, it's their choice to become a priest. There are religions that allow them to get married, like Seventh-day Adventists. I don't know what kind of minister or reverend he is, but they allow them to get married. So I know it's a little different, but if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should maybe think about a different faith. [Can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?] Um, which part? About... [Um] Just the changing ways. [That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess.] Oh, about the pedophilia. [Mm hmm.] Um, I think, like, the whole... [Um] Sexuality is before about being genetic. I think it's genetic. I don't think people just become that way. I think they're born that way. I don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up. It might have something to do a little more in this case, but I think it's their genetics. And you can't hide that through a marriage. You could try, but it would usually come out. So I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, but I don't think in all cases they knew. [Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?] Um, no.",
            "I was initially okay with the premise of the Iraq war, but I think that the repercussions of the 9/11 attacks were still very much lingering, and we went to war in Iraq under a pretext, with many indications that we had already been moving towards Iraq. I believe the Bush administration at the time tied the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven to be false. That really got under my skin, and overall, the Iraq war has been a real sore spot for me. \n\nI think the Bush administration was very openly lying to the American people and still hasn't owned up to it. Even Colin Powell has come out and said that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he presented it at the UN. To me, that's a serious malfeasance in office, and I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since at least the 9/11 attacks. They came into office with the intention of going to war, I believe. \n\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely fired from his office. It seems to me that the younger Bush came in with a bloodlust feeling towards Saddam Hussein due to his dad's administration, and I think he was hoping to expand our energy supply in the long run, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving towards now seems to be like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, coming in to try to restore order. But I'm not entirely sure that's a good idea either because I think in the long term it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become a major issue. \n\nAs it stands, the interim government is dissolving, and from the news reports, I've heard that the Iraqi Parliament is not very effective at all. The Prime Minister doesn't really have control over the political process, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we're still dealing with these fractious radical elements vying for control of the government. And I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I want to say something.\nMmhmm\nJust say anything?\nOkay\nOkay, that's cool\nUmum\nI'm sorry\nOkay\nLet's talk about how I feel about the Iraq War.\nLet me think\nAt this point, I think it's pointless because it wasn't even declared a war.\nI think it's just to get back at Iraq because we think they did the 9/11 attack.\nSo I don't think it's a reason for anything.\nI mean, I'm not a big person on the War in Iraq.\nSo I don't really keep up with it.\nI don't know the details of it.\nBut I do know that we're staying there to try to build a democracy, so it can become like another U.S. thing.\nAnd also to get oil and resources from them.\nBut that's no reason to stay there because it's just making everyone mad.\nSo if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try to build a democracy, which takes forever because you can't build a democracy in just a day.\nAnd then if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves.\nUm let me think\nThis is a really hard topic\nThis is one topic I don't know anything about\nUm Iraq War\nOh this is hard\nUh I don't know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOkay thanks\nUm Well actually I think\nI think the war should continue because it's not fair\nI don't think we should call it a war anymore\nBecause I don't think\nYou know\nThe only reason we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don't think there's a huge reason for us to call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn't even call it\nIt shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it was never declared a war by Congress\nI think that's how it works\nYou have to declare a war by Congress\nAnd then it's\nI just don't think it's a big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them\nBut it's also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like\nIt's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it's doing and it's like\nAnd what it's doing to like\nRemember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nThe Vietnam War was like an undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he's like saying\nHe'll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nYou have to make this a half an hour don't you?\nUh\nOkay yeah\nUm\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt's like\nIt's hard to say\nI want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it's going to be even worse for them\nAnd it's going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them\nAnd they've been going on this whole like\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it's gonna\nThat it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat's about it\nOkay",
            "Uh\nI really don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. \nI believe it's entirely up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state.\nIt's clear\nIt's clear\nUh\nIt's\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that's really choosing one church's belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don't support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don't feel that it's right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don't see why he's pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it's up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don't know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "The Iraq War\nOkay\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nStarting from the beginning, I think the US government did not completely honestly tell the American people the reasons for invading Iraq\nBefore invading Iraq, I thought\nI thought they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks\nHowever, they were not really related to each other\nBut the government made it seem that way, and utilized the outrage of the American people over the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq, which started in 2003\nOkay\nI\nI myself and pretty much everyone else are against war\nEspecially to make a preemptive strike, I was against it\nOkay\nI think the Iraq War is kind of\nA repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War\nThe US government should learn from past mistakes\nI think\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died\n\nThis is horrible\nWhat they were\nWhat they were doing was\nThey were removing the country's government\nI really don't think the US government was prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum and the chaos that was going to occur\nOkay\nAnd the US government\nAnd the US government removed the Iraqi government\nThey are trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq\nThis is similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd to implement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear-cut victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nBecause\nBecause\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in, there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army\n\nYou're fighting the citizens of the country\nSpecific citizens in the country\nSo\nSo I think\nI think the government\nSo I think the government\nIf you're going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government\nI mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there's still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that\nThat the US government wasn't prepared, in a way, tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a\nA short, successful invasion of Iraq\nI mean we shouldn't\nWe're kinda\nWe're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was a lot of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIt's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like an easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nThe Iraq War\nWell\nThat's\nNo that's\nNo that's a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling, I guess, in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what he started and\nAnd so I mean once you're in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we're the ones that took away their government and\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them\nAbandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see it through to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to continue risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we're\nIf we're\nIf we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we get our oil from\nAnd it's usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions\n\nLet's see\nUm\nI just hope it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",
            "Let's see, I'm for gay marriage. I've always been. Um, I really think it's a personal preference and uh, and it's been proven more and more now that it could be biological, as opposed to sociological, so to give people less rights due to something that's really not any of their control. Um, because they can't control it. I think it's inhumane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nUh, I don't think there's any reason for politics and government to have any part in this. It's not even on a state level, it's a personal level, it's a household level. You know, in my neighborhood at home, there are I think two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. Um, but they function the same way any other family would, you know, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would, and I think that, uh, Bush trying to play God here and interpret the words of marriage the way that he wants to, I think it's ridiculous.\n\nCertainly, yes, I mean I think, I mean I believe I've read and heard from numerous different, uh, publications and TV reports or newspapers, whatever, on that, it's something now that's been proven to be a chemical thing in your brain, it's something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual. As opposed to, uh, growing up and you know, maybe with like four sisters and you're the only brother and you know, you don't have a father, that doesn't necessarily have anything to do with it, so that would be the biological side, opposed to sociological.\n\nUm, well, other than that, I guess the obvious reason is that, uh, I think maybe because marriage is something that, if a guy and a girl want to do it, they can without telling a single person just go to, uh, Las Vegas and do it, but if two gay people want to do it, it's going to make the front page of, uh, the New York Times, you know. I think it's kinda the type of thing it should be a personal, private, uh, sector-type thing, opposed to, uh, public domain and, uh, national, uh, federal domain.\n\nUh, no, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control people's opinions about you. As an RA, I've already had to deal with this kind of situation. When you put something out there, it affects your image. Especially if you're talking about explosions or shootings, people will say something. You can't just let that out and expose it to the public. The internet is open to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get that bulletin from them. If it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin, then someone went to the school and they have to take action. They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they might be able to prevent it. [Right] On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just mess around like that. Maybe it could be like the situation we had at school where the experiment went terribly wrong. Maybe it's just a sociology class experiment that didn't go well. I think I forgot the word for a minute. It could be something serious or something very dangerous. What happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school, then they reported it, and when we finally figured out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some things on there that he might have meant as a joke but became serious in the situation. When you put something out on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it out. If you don't want someone to find it, don't post it. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't control their thoughts. You can't control people's perceptions of what's serious or not. I think school officials shouldn't be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and monitoring them, and looking through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy because it's brought by someone you gave access to. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, that's a different story altogether. Yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because that's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because honestly, I don't want to know if they're going out and partying and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I'd have to take action. That's not my place, so I don't even want that connection. Not really.",
            "I feel like the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI think the original purpose was good. \nBut I think we've lost sight of that purpose a long time ago. \nNow we might just be doing it for the sake of doing it, just to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI think maybe the original motive was already questionable, related to George Bush's father's past conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nSo I think \nIf the original motivation was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would be a fair motivation if there weren't any personal interests involved. I don't think it would be fair if there were personal interests. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nI think we conveyed our purpose in the first few months of the war; that was a statement in itself. \nBut the fact that it's been going on for over a year or several years, I think it's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I think \nI mean, if our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think \nI think our reason has become distorted and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, and we don't want to come out of this thing without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYeah, I do think it's been going on long enough, and it should stop. \nI mean, there comes a point when their government, their officials will have to fend for themselves anyway. \nAnd I think that time has come. \nWe've been spending billions of dollars on this war when we have our own problems at home, such as poverty and whatnot, that we should be spending that money on. I think it's a drain on our economy for a purpose that's been dragged out for too long. \n\nYeah, I mean, they're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously other things we need to fund, such as poverty or internal improvements, you know, public roads, anything dealing with schools, healthcare. \nWe certainly have a lot of problems to fund those things, and I think that money could be better spent on those things. \nRight now, that money's being spent to kill some of our own citizens in a foreign country in a war that we've lost the cause for. \n\nThat's it.",

I mean, I hate to say it, but I don't want to join the bandwagon of people who are like, 'I was against it from the beginning.' Um, I was, but it's not really important anymore. Because generally, everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except within the administration, because they don't want to admit they were wrong. And, um, you just have to look at recent polls. Um, they've done US polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean, no, like 75 to 80% of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea. 80% of Iraqis, um, 70% of the troops that are over there, like the US troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should withdraw within the year. Um, I don't know. It's just been a complete disaster from before we even went in. It was already a disaster. And now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to deal with the Middle East anymore. Um, I mean, I think it's just the culture clash between the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean, it's just too big a gap and for this administration to understand or previous administrations. And they think they can just bring democracy to an area where it shouldn't exist. Like that's not the way that, um, this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy. I don't think anyone's arguing that he's not. But, I mean, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand when we went over there. Um, I don't even know what to say about it. Um, I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. Um, I mean I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there. Um, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out. I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. Um, I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, um, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. Um, I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that 80% of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people we're trying to save, like we're trying to help, telling us to leave. Um, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to hell, we could be like, well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. Um, and then you know at least we'll I mean if we decide to help out after that we'll at least be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East.

            "I think there is still gender discrimination in American society. Although it's not just women who are affected, women will find it more difficult in certain specific fields. For example, even though there should be an equal environment, many people still have a hard time finding a job where they can work together with a woman. This is because the social concept has deeply taken root. Many times, women will find they have the qualifications for a certain job, but the board won't choose to promote them to that position because historically women are not often seen in the upper echelons of the business world. The same thing is true for men, such as in the fashion industry or taking care of the family. It's very rare for a man to stay at home and take care of the children. Many people stigmatize this because they think men should be working to make money. This can be very hard on men because they may have always dreamed of staying at home to take care of the children and help their wives' careers thrive, and it's working out fine for them, but society stigmatizes it. In the fashion industry, many people won't take males seriously if they're straight. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I think it's because males who are into fashion typically have different lifestyles. So if you have the typical male lifestyle and you're in the fashion industry, people will be like, \"Wait, how do I really know if you know fashion if it's for a woman? You don't really know what our case is like.\" Depending on the field of work you're in, I feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. To change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and we've come a long way from the 1800s and made leaps and bounds, but change is slow. So I feel that if we continue at the pace we are now, because women are rising to higher positions and becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in the business world, and it's a slow process, but it's happening and people are starting to accept it more. Just like how men who are stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works,\" and um, then for like fashion people will be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they're listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff,\" and so they do know like where I'm coming from. So I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against by not being too pushy but saying like the qualities of them. Because if you force it people are going to resist. And I feel that we're kind of at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that. So I don't really know if there's anything that we can do right now that isn't already being done because if you do it too fast it's like people will resist, and we've come a long way and change takes time. Yes, um, well, I guess they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you're from. Like if you grew up on a farm and your grammar may not be the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you work your way up into a CEO job, even though you may not have the best grammar in the world or even though you may be intelligent but you don't have the best grammar in the world, other men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right?\" So, yeah, so like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you and like from gender to gender. I don't know, I guess that's another example, um, not really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't completely legalize it, but rather decriminalized it. Which knocked it down from a serious criminal offense to more like a traffic ticket. You know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, those types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge. Well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff, I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons, like, why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so, to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so, it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because their many things are very traditional, like they've done the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be adaptable to change. Many Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my mom was an Episcopalian, my dad was an Episcopalian, my mom was a Catholic, and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to know that you have to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it, I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their, like, pedophilic behavior, so because it's just a different realm, it might, but I probably don't think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like people who molest children, probably would do that regardless of whether they have a spouse or not, because it's a child which is different than a spouse, so if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married, like I don't think, allowing priests to be married would prevent, uh, those things from happening, I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "I haven't made up my mind on this matter yet, so I can't say which side is right or wrong. However, I think this is one of the most complicated issues we're facing today. Because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are very delicate issues. And it's hard to define marriage without offending anyone. So, I don't know what I'm thinking. I think all civil unions are... I don't know if marriage should be looked at as defined by the government because it's considered a sacrament, so people get tax breaks or looked at in a certain way by the government if they were baptized. And if you're married, I think they should just look at it as a civil union because that's what it is - two people. They shouldn't have the separation of church and state, and they shouldn't care about what kind of marriage it was - two people got united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it's just two people who got a civil union. Um, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's something that the constitution shouldn't be amended for just because it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage, simply put. Uh, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is kind of a gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. I think I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be decided by each state rather than the president. Many states are democratic and many are republican. Obviously, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you naturally know how that state feels about that issue. And if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, I don't think you have the right to disagree with that decision because you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I already answered that. But I don't think Bush should have the right to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's going to be out of office in about two years. And if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just keep going back and forth. It should be up to each state because they are the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "Um, I don't completely agree. I think it's like this. Let's see. I'm trying to figure it out. MySpace is a public thing, and a bulletin board. You know, if you look at that definition, then you know it's basically for the public or others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will be seeing that, whether it's school officials or not. So in my opinion, I feel like school officials seeing that, they have every right to see it. Because even if they weren't posting it under the school's name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system. I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here. Like, you know, if they go on the internet like on MySpace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel like that's an invasion of privacy. But um, I feel like, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYeah, um, alright, well, um, it's a lot easier to express yourself when you're writing a lot longer. But, um, like what I was saying, it's a public thing, and with a student posting something on MySpace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous. Um, everything like I'm worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say, I don't ever say that on an email, because I'm afraid someone will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy, they'll find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it's on the internet, it's always on the internet, and um, you know, if you do something like that, there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble. And I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and um, I don't know, let's see here.\n\nUm, like I had said before, I don't feel like they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel like that's perfectly fine for them, or um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school, they feel like, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place. I've actually discussed that with a um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and um, they said, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lockdowns, and stuff, and um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drills and stuff, and even though that doesn't have anything to do with the school shooting, because um, that was in case people would come into the building, I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like Columbine or something like that, um, yeah, that's basically all I can come up with.\n\nUh, no, that's about it.",
            "Well \nUh, \nThe war \nUh, \nAt first, I supported the invasion because I was personally affected by 9/11 \nUh, \nI thought we should do the same thing here, create as much chaos as they did here \nUh, \nI think because 9/11 was an emotional thing, we overlooked a lot of things and didn't think about the long-term consequences \nWe went there unprepared, no plan, \nUh, \nI think it backfired on us \nUh, \nI don't know \nI was all for it then, but now I'm completely against it \nI don't think it achieved anything \nUh, \nI think the people over there \nAs long as they're fighting with each other, they can't fight with us \nLike, I don't think our being there will make a difference if they can't even get along with themselves \nSo uh, \nBecause of 9/11, I'm almost apathetic about what's going on over there \nUh, \nWith those people, I just don't care \nI just think \nI don't think they're human \nI don't know \nThey're just fighting with each other and can't do anything \nUh, \nI really don't care \nUh, \nI don't know \nWe went over there completely unprepared, without any idea of what we'd face \nUh, \nIt's also bad because war is very different for them than it is for us \nThey're just savage people when it comes to war and I don't think they're trying to improve their country \nI just think they want us to leave \nAnd I think that's fine for us \nI think we should just leave and that's it \nUh, \nI think we were just hyped up, not thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in and tried to change their whole lifestyle \nUh, \nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened \nAnd uh, \nAlso, I think he took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq \nUh, \nBut at the time, I understood where he was coming from \nWe really \nI don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay, let's rebuild and that's it \nSo \nUh, \nI don't think we could have let it go \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were going to do \nI don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of creating order \nAnd I don't know \nI just think that they didn't \nThere was no unity \nThey didn't know what they were going into \nSo I think that would have helped us a lot more \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with \nSo that's what we created in turn in there \nUh, \nHonestly, I don't \nI don't think we're the ones to change those people \nHonestly, I think they're always going to be like that \nAnd uh, \nI don't \nI really don't have anything else to say \nIt's gone on for too long \nUh, \nI don't think we're making enough progress \nWe've made some progress, but not enough to stay there \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay there \nOnce we leave, it's just going to collapse \nAnd we can't stay over there forever \nSo I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there \nNo \nWell"
