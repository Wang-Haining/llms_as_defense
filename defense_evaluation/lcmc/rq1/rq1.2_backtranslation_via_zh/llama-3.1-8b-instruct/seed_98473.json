            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change its views. They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else.",
            "I personally think that supporting same-sex marriage isn't a problem. I have some thoughts, I think they shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation as if it's a conscious decision. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. Although I haven't put a lot of thought into the topic, I still think it's wrong to say that. It seems like it's not a choice, but their nature. Like me being straight, another person being gay, it's not a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. The government shouldn't intervene because it's not a legal issue, it's not a moral issue. Gay people shouldn't be seen as making a wrong decision because of their sexual orientation. The government actually has no right to interfere. This is tough. I don't think the government should intervene because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral issues or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to intervene in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. The, who, you know, gay people. That's just how they're born or at least that's what I think and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized.\n\nBecause basically there's no good reason to oppose it.\n\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\n\nBut it's very different. There are many different aspects to it, and it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing. Where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family.\n\nAnd I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use like oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances but we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana then there's no point in doing that for me you should embrace its beneficial properties I think",
            "I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.",
            "Laughing \nWell, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I think we invaded Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us to Iraq. I think the early Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which have since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nWell, it just seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people openly and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least 9/11. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nThe last part, I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of his office. But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um, I can't remember the name of the Prime Minister, but he really has no control over the political process or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUh (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did a few things, just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",
            "I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the church because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear. It's clearly written in the constitution that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written. So, in terms of the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they're really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see most of the Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution, and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think it's right at all, in that aspect. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't know why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything. It could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Well the war in Iraq. OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that. Um And I think that it's the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with. I mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don't think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um and here and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam they were trying to push out Communists and implement and uphold democracy and it's and it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear I mean it was more of a it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because Um because because there because there are there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army you're fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country and so I think I think that the government so first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war cause I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be you need to plan for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still Um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so the war in Iraq well that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why isn't it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "When you put something on the internet, it's like an open forum.  It's totally public.  You can't control it.  I mean, as an RA, I've actually had to deal with this.  Uh, when you put something out there, it affects people's opinions of you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna say something.  You can't put that out there.  It's going to be seen by everybody.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin.  Someone went to the school and they have to act on that.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that.  I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school.  It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class.  I think that word I couldn't remember for a minute, uh.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI believe the initial intention was good. \nHowever, I think we've lost sight of that intention a long time ago. \nWe're just maybe doing it to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI just think the initial motives were questionable, related to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the original intention was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, I think that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal issues involved, I don't think it would be fair. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nHowever, I don't think our reasons have been deteriorated and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, and we don't want to end this thing without a decisive victory or conclusion. \nI think it's gone on long enough, and it should stop. \nTheir government and officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. \nI think that time has come. \nWe've been draining our economy for a long time, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be addressing. \nI think it's a heavy burden on our economy, as the purpose has been stretched to absurdity. \nThey're spending billions and billions of dollars. \nWar shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously issues like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, etc. \nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as healthcare, which I think could be better spent on. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the reason for.",
            "I'd like to clarify one thing, but I'm not sure if it's relevant. It's just that someone was online and they found out some stuff. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but on sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's basically public. And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think it's actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have someone just sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. But then it becomes some kind of discrimination if they're only looking at the bad kids. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it all depends on the situation - maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to see it, or maybe they were actually looking for evidence of something. So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online. He went onto someone's profile and got their screen name right away, and then talked to them on instant messenger and got them to meet him in under a minute. I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nUh, yeah, I've heard that my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was an issue about students being banned from having Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me, and I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace. I'm not even sure if that's a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to do that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I have.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",
            "We feel that there's still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States. I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender. For example, if you're from a rural area and your grammar isn't great, but you're extremely intelligent, and you work your way up to be a CEO, other men might look down on you and think, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put together a sentence?\" Or if you're intelligent but your grammar isn't great, other men might look down on you. So, our society might discriminate against you because of your gender and where you're from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't abolish it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, um, I mean for a variety of reasons. But there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because many of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "This problem I still haven't made up my mind on. So I can't say right or wrong on either side. But I think this is the most complex issue we're dealing with today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a headache. Because any definition will make some people unhappy. So I don't know, I think all civil unions don't necessarily have to be defined as marriage by the government. And since it's a religious ceremony, if you get married, you'll get tax breaks, or the government will consider you a special type. So if you get married, I think the government should just consider it a civil union because that's what it is, it's just two people. They shouldn't separate church and state, they shouldn't consider what kind of marriage it is, two people are combined. And also, same-sex marriage, I mean, it's just a civil union. Um, if all the states can reach a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just ridiculous. Because the constitution shouldn't be amended for some minor matters. I mean, it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban same-sex marriage, to put it simply. Uh, no.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family, so homosexuality is a gray area for me. \nBecause I have many gay friends, I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle, but I believe it should be legalized. \nI don't think it should be a national issue. \nHowever, I think it should be up to each state to decide rather than the president.\n\nA lot of states are democratic and a lot of states are republican. \nObviously, democratic states will be in favor of gay marriage. \nIf you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. \nI don't think you should disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage, as you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I believe it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI actually already answered that. \nI don't think Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. \nI think it should be up to individual states to decide whether they want to legalize it. \nI don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. \nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. \nPlus, he'll be out of office in about two years. \nIf a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. \nIt should just be up to each individual state, because they're the ones who will have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo I don't.",
            "No, I don’t agree at all. \nLet me think about it. \nI think, Myspace is a public thing. \nAnd, bulletin board. \nYou know. \nIf you look at that definition, then you know, that basically it’s to post for the public to see or for others to see. \nNo matter what you’re trying to get at. \nAnd now if you post that on the internet, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. \nIn my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it. \nBecause, even if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name, they could have still accessed it through their homes. \nBut uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that’s perfectly fine. \nLet me see here, like, if they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy. \nBut, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save, you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don’t think that’s an invasion at all. \nShould I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, uh, it’s a lot easier to express yourself a lot longer when you’re writing. \nAlright, well, uh, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that’s ridiculous. \nEverything, like I’m worried to post stuff like even through emails, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email because I’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt I guess you could say. \nLike, you know, if you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and like, once it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet, and you know, if you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don’t, it wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy, because you know, like I said before, and well, that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing, and I don’t know, let’s see here. \n\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, then I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them, or other officials such as the police to go on, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they’re dropping them off at a safe place, I’ve actually discussed that with a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, uh, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, uh, in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and even though that doesn’t have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, uh, that was incase people would come into the building I guess, uh, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, uh, in order to make the school a safer place, and that’s just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, uh, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, uh, yeah that’s basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that’s about it",
            "Okay, well, the war, um, at first I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run. \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. \nI really think that it backfired on us. \nI don’t know, I was all for it, but now I’m very against it. \nI don’t think it did anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re unable to get along with themselves. \nUnfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. \nWith those people, I just don’t care. \nI just think they’re not human. \nI don’t know, like they fight with each other and they can’t do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don’t care. \nI don’t know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. \nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there. \nIt’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there. \nAnd I think that should be fine for us. \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it. \nWe just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything. \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, also their whole culture. \nI just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. \nAnd, um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it. \nSo, I don’t think we could have let it go. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do in terms of I guess like creating order and, um, stability. \nAnd I don’t know, I just think that they didn’t have, there was no unity. \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for. \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn in there. \nHonestly, I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they’re always going to be like that. \nAnd, um, I don’t, I really don’t have anything else to say. \nIt’s gone on long enough. \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. \nWe’ve made progress, but not enough to stay in there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever. \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change its views. They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else.",
            "I personally think that supporting same-sex marriage isn't a problem. I have some thoughts, I think they shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation as if it's a conscious decision. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. Although I haven't put a lot of thought into the topic, I still think it's wrong to say that. It seems like it's not a choice, but their nature. Like me being straight, another person being gay, it's not a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. The government shouldn't intervene because it's not a legal issue, it's not a moral issue. Gay people shouldn't be seen as making a wrong decision because of their sexual orientation. The government actually has no right to interfere. This is tough. I don't think the government should intervene because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral issues or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to intervene in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. The, who, you know, gay people. That's just how they're born or at least that's what I think and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized.\n\nBecause basically there's no good reason to oppose it.\n\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\n\nBut it's very different. There are many different aspects to it, and it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing. Where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family.\n\nAnd I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use like oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances but we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana then there's no point in doing that for me you should embrace its beneficial properties I think",
            "I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.",
            "Laughing \nWell, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I think we invaded Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us to Iraq. I think the early Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which have since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nWell, it just seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people openly and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least 9/11. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nThe last part, I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of his office. But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um, I can't remember the name of the Prime Minister, but he really has no control over the political process or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUh (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did a few things, just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",
            "I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the church because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear. It's clearly written in the constitution that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written. So, in terms of the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they're really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see most of the Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution, and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think it's right at all, in that aspect. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't know why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything. It could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Well the war in Iraq. OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that. Um And I think that it's the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with. I mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don't think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um and here and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam they were trying to push out Communists and implement and uphold democracy and it's and it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear I mean it was more of a it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because Um because because there because there are there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army you're fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country and so I think I think that the government so first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war cause I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be you need to plan for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still Um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so the war in Iraq well that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why isn't it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "When you put something on the internet, it's like an open forum.  It's totally public.  You can't control it.  I mean, as an RA, I've actually had to deal with this.  Uh, when you put something out there, it affects people's opinions of you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna say something.  You can't put that out there.  It's going to be seen by everybody.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin.  Someone went to the school and they have to act on that.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that.  I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school.  It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class.  I think that word I couldn't remember for a minute, uh.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI believe the initial intention was good. \nHowever, I think we've lost sight of that intention a long time ago. \nWe're just maybe doing it to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI just think the initial motives were questionable, related to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the original intention was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, I think that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal issues involved, I don't think it would be fair. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nHowever, I don't think our reasons have been deteriorated and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, and we don't want to end this thing without a decisive victory or conclusion. \nI think it's gone on long enough, and it should stop. \nTheir government and officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. \nI think that time has come. \nWe've been draining our economy for a long time, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be addressing. \nI think it's a heavy burden on our economy, as the purpose has been stretched to absurdity. \nThey're spending billions and billions of dollars. \nWar shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously issues like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, etc. \nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as healthcare, which I think could be better spent on. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the reason for.",
            "I'd like to clarify one thing, but I'm not sure if it's relevant. It's just that someone was online and they found out some stuff. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but on sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's basically public. And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think it's actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have someone just sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. But then it becomes some kind of discrimination if they're only looking at the bad kids. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it all depends on the situation - maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to see it, or maybe they were actually looking for evidence of something. So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online. He went onto someone's profile and got their screen name right away, and then talked to them on instant messenger and got them to meet him in under a minute. I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nUh, yeah, I've heard that my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was an issue about students being banned from having Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me, and I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace. I'm not even sure if that's a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to do that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I have.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",
            "We feel that there's still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States. I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender. For example, if you're from a rural area and your grammar isn't great, but you're extremely intelligent, and you work your way up to be a CEO, other men might look down on you and think, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put together a sentence?\" Or if you're intelligent but your grammar isn't great, other men might look down on you. So, our society might discriminate against you because of your gender and where you're from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't abolish it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, um, I mean for a variety of reasons. But there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because many of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "This problem I still haven't made up my mind on. So I can't say right or wrong on either side. But I think this is the most complex issue we're dealing with today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a headache. Because any definition will make some people unhappy. So I don't know, I think all civil unions don't necessarily have to be defined as marriage by the government. And since it's a religious ceremony, if you get married, you'll get tax breaks, or the government will consider you a special type. So if you get married, I think the government should just consider it a civil union because that's what it is, it's just two people. They shouldn't separate church and state, they shouldn't consider what kind of marriage it is, two people are combined. And also, same-sex marriage, I mean, it's just a civil union. Um, if all the states can reach a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just ridiculous. Because the constitution shouldn't be amended for some minor matters. I mean, it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban same-sex marriage, to put it simply. Uh, no.",

            "Okay, well, the war, um, at first I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run. \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. \nI really think that it backfired on us. \nI don’t know, I was all for it, but now I’m very against it. \nI don’t think it did anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re unable to get along with themselves. \nUnfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. \nWith those people, I just don’t care. \nI just think they’re not human. \nI don’t know, like they fight with each other and they can’t do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don’t care. \nI don’t know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. \nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there. \nIt’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there. \nAnd I think that should be fine for us. \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it. \nWe just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything. \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, also their whole culture. \nI just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. \nAnd, um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it. \nSo, I don’t think we could have let it go. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do in terms of I guess like creating order and, um, stability. \nAnd I don’t know, I just think that they didn’t have, there was no unity. \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for. \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn in there. \nHonestly, I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they’re always going to be like that. \nAnd, um, I don’t, I really don’t have anything else to say. \nIt’s gone on long enough. \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. \nWe’ve made progress, but not enough to stay in there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever. \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. \nNo, okay."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change its views. They've been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its followers, and I think it's because the Catholic Church isn't accepting enough of many things. They have very strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is fine, but some of their views are a bit outdated in certain ways. If they were to adapt to some newer ideas, they wouldn't worry about losing followers. I've heard that many people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church because of their views on these issues. People are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain matters, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views. The Catholic Church opposes abortion, so if you're for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a following that teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for gay marriage and related issues - if you believe in or want to practice them, you might not want to be in a following that disagrees with it. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. However, I'm not sure if that would have prevented what happened. It's unclear if they would have acted differently if they could get married or have female priests. It's hard to say. I don't see why priests can't have both a family and a job, as everyone else does. The Catholic Church says that priests are essentially married to God and devoted to their complete lives, but I don't see why they can't have both like everyone else.",
            "I personally think that supporting same-sex marriage isn't a problem. I have some thoughts, I think they shouldn’t be held responsible for their sexual orientation as if it's a conscious decision. So I think that gay people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. Although I haven't put a lot of thought into the topic, I still think it's wrong to say that. It seems like it's not a choice, but their nature. Like me being straight, another person being gay, it's not a conscious decision they should be held accountable for. The government shouldn't intervene because it's not a legal issue, it's not a moral issue. Gay people shouldn't be seen as making a wrong decision because of their sexual orientation. The government actually has no right to interfere. This is tough. I don't think the government should intervene because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral issues or anything like that. It just seems like they're out of place. It doesn't seem like they have any right to intervene in people's lives. And you know, that's just who they are. The, who, you know, gay people. That's just how they're born or at least that's what I think and I mean they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think same-sex marriage should be legalized.\n\nBecause basically there's no good reason to oppose it.\n\nMany people believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\n\nBut it's very different. There are many different aspects to it, and it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. But it's like the same thing. And there are a bunch of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing. Where your partner can't be in the room with you if you're sick and can't visit because they're not technically family.\n\nAnd I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days. And same-sex couples have the same kind of success rates, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do.\n\nIt's just a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up on is that homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church; they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government.\n\nAnd if there's no involvement with church and state, then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand why some Catholics can get hung up on, \"Oh, that's against our religion, that's morally wrong for us, and we can't approve of that sort of thing.\" But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them to get married?\n\nIt's like segregation, separate but unequal.\n\nYes, they're the same in many ways, like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community.\n\nAnd especially about children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society, and whether or not they'll be influenced by their parents' sexual orientation or not. But well, again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say, I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption because I think the main drawback to that is how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society.\n\nLike in New York City, I know they have special schools for children of gay parents because in public schools in New York City, they get beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid. I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything. Parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples.\n\nAnd so, they can be community involved or not like straight couples choose to. I mean, it's just about personality choices.\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making same-sex marriage legal in every state. I think the amendment should just be the opposite.\n\nBut well, I think President Bush has very strong views on this, his take on gay marriage actually, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which I think most of the reasons I've heard, at least like in the news and stuff, are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say is negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person. And to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account the fact that the government is creating a law to ban gay marriage is completely hypocritical, considering the recent controversy about \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country.\n\nUm, just one, a lot of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, the gayness resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents or just a personality defect.\n\nAnd that's also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church, then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.",
            "I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use like oxycotton, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing, and those are controlled substances but we use them all the time because they're beneficial and if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana then there's no point in doing that for me you should embrace its beneficial properties I think",
            "I was just thinking about the church and I think they've adapted to the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. Even though I've grown older, I still remember when I was younger I'd always go to church every Sunday, wearing cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. This was my usual outfit whenever I went to church, and I went to a private school, so I'd see all my friends there on the weekends, and we'd just go together. However, as I've gotten older, they've introduced these teenager masses, and they've reduced it to 30 minutes. People dress a lot more casually now, especially during summer, people would come in their beach clothes straight from the beach. You'd see families rushing in late. I think it's become a lot more casual, even at the morning masses where I used to always dress up. People are wearing jeans and khakis now; khakis are nice too, but it's just a lot more casual. As for other things, that's the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the politics within the church, though. Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests for pedophilia, I think it wouldn't have made a difference if the church allowed female priests or allowed priests to get married. There are married men who still become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids, so I don't think it's because they're allowed to get married or not. I think it's also because when they choose to become priests, it's their personal choice, and there are religions that allow priests to get married, like Seventh Heaven, I think their reverend or minister can get married. So, I know it's a bit different, but if they want to follow their faith and get married at the same time, they should maybe consider a different faith. As for my answer, can you elaborate on which part? About the pedophilia? I think pedophilia is more based on genetics, rather than being influenced by environment. I think people are born with it, it's not because of how they're raised. It might have a little something to do with their environment, but I think it's their genetics. You can't change that through marriage; you might try, but it would usually come out eventually. So, I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent it from happening. If they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, they should be ashamed, but I don't think that was the case in all situations.",
            "Laughing \nWell, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and I think we invaded Iraq as a pretext, there were pretexts that led us to Iraq. I think the early Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which have since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war still boils my blood. \n\nWell, it just seems to me that the Bush administration has been lying to the American people openly and has yet to own up to that fact. Even Colin Powell, I mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he really wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And that's just malfeasance in office, I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since at least 9/11. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war. \n\nThe last part, I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of his office. But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is also a very underhanded way to do things. \n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point. \n\nJust from the news reports I've heard it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Um, I can't remember the name of the Prime Minister, but he really has no control over the political process or what's happening, and even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting, I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with a fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government, and I think the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that. \n\nUh (laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company.",
            "I did a few things, just talked into it, okay, okay, it's good, uh, yeah, okay, I'm sorry, okay, how I feel about the war in Iraq, let me see, at this point I feel it's kind of pointless, because it's not even a declared war actually, and I feel like it was just a big get back at Iraq thing because that's who we figured bombed the U.S., like who had done the terrorist attacks on nine eleven, so I don't feel like, I mean I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't keep up with it, I don't know the big details of it, but at this point I know that we're kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing, and then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them, but it's no reason for staying over there because it's making everyone upset, so and then like if we stay over there then what's gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can't be built in just a day, and then if we like leave they'll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves, um, let me see, ohh this is so hard, this is the one topic I don't know anything about, um, war in Iraq, oh this hard, uh, mmm, uhh I don't know, do you have anything else I can go off of, okay, thank you, um, well um, actually I think I think the war should continue because it's not fair, I don't think we should call it a war anymore, but because I don't think that, you know, I think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that, you know, that we're big and we're American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns, but I don't feel like there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore, because like we didn't even call it it shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it never was declared a war by congress, I think that's how the whole thing works, you have to declare a war by congress, and then it's I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try, actually no I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to like help them, but it's also like wasting our resources, and especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like, and what it's doing to like cause remember I think with the whole Vietnam thing Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so you have to make this a half an hour don't you, uh, okay yeah um, huh, I guess you could also say that it is like it's hard to say that I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of that are in whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like these people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took I bet some of the kids don't even have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have but then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States that it's going to be even worse for them and it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them and they've been going on this whole like um totalitarian like a whole dictatorship thing for so long that you know I feel like it's gonna that it's kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there so I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years hmm that's about it okay",
            "I don't think it's right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal. I think it's really up to the church because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear. It's clearly written in the constitution that trying to do anything with it, trying to enforce any kind of power over it would really be in defiance of what has already been said and written. So, in terms of the people who are trying to make it illegal, I think they're really choosing one church's belief over another. Because as we can see most of the Catholics and Christians are really against it and don't support it except in Boston and some of those areas. But um, I don't think that it's really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal. Well, separation of church and state is pretty much like been a key aspect of the constitution, and what's really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States. And even though they did plan on making an amendment, I think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong and just in contradictory to what's already been said and written there. And plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments that's actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government. So I don't think it's right at all, in that aspect. No, I don't believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue. I don't know why he's pushing for this amendment except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this, not for the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else if anything. It could possibly boost it I think by I don't know how but I think it might have a better impact on society than it would not. Not quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Well the war in Iraq. OK. To start from the beginning I don't think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq and I think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn't have that much to do with the other. But the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um I myself and pretty much against war especially to make a preemptive strike I was against that. Um And I think that it's the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with. I mean the tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible and what they were doing is that they were taking out the countries government and I really don't think the government the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um and here and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and they are trying to implant a democratic government and it's kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam they were trying to push out Communists and implement and uphold democracy and it's and it's and it's and the government and the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn't like it wasn't a clear I mean it was more of a it was more of a loss in Vietnam because because Um because because there because there are there are no matter how many people may have supported no matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when when you're not fighting an actual army you're fighting the citizens the specific citizens in the country and so I think I think that the government so first of all I think that we shouldn't have gotten into into war cause I'm against it in pretty much all cases and but if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be you need to plan for all possible outcomes I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been I mean worst and either for what would really not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and I mean we're still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we're still Um many American troops are still dying and and there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi and the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process and I just think that that the US government in a way tried to well they weren't prepared themselves but in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a a short successful stay in Iraq and I mean we shouldn't we're kinda we're naive for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful I mean in our own country democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was there was lots of tension and there was civil war and um its just not an easy thing to do and I think the government the US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do and um so so the war in Iraq well that's no that's no that's a difficult decision to make because that was well that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of um one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and and so I mean once you go in there and we've been in there for so long how can we abandon these people I mean we're the ones that took away their government and and their way of life so how can we abandon them now so so it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but then again there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and and and how and how much is is too much to to to keep risking for for a free democratic Iraq I mean going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq I mean if we're invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why isn't it just Iraq why aren't we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is is the oil issue and this is where we are getting our oil from and it's usually all about money and controlling resources I mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found and yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them so I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet's see um I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not",

            "When you put something on the internet, it's like an open forum.  It's totally public.  You can't control it.  I mean, as an RA, I've actually had to deal with this.  Uh, when you put something out there, it affects people's opinions of you.  If you're talking about blowing things up or shootings, someone's gonna say something.  You can't put that out there.  It's going to be seen by everybody.  If you're friends with that person on Myspace, you get that bulletin.  Obviously, it wasn't the school that got the bulletin.  Someone went to the school and they have to act on that.  They can't just let it sit there because then God forbid something happens, they could have prevented it.  [Right]  On the other hand, you don't know what to take seriously because some people just fool around like that.  I mean, it could be like the situation we had at school.  It could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class.  I think that word I couldn't remember for a minute, uh.  And it could also be something very serious.  I think what happened here was that something happened and someone overheard someone saying something in the school and then they called it in and when we finally found out who the person was, they looked through their Facebook and got worried because there were some certain things on there that he may have meant as a joke.  But in light of the situation, it became very serious.  When you put stuff out into the public forum of the internet, there's really no invasion of privacy that happens.  If you don't want it out there, don't put it there.  If you don't want someone to find it, if you don't want someone to think something of you, you can't tell them what to think.  You can't tell people what to take seriously or not.  I mean, I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them, and going through Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals.  But if it is brought to the attention of the school officials, there's really no invasion of privacy there because it's brought by someone who you gave access to it.  And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously.  I mean, like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs.  If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different.  Uh, yeah, don't think, like, a teacher should not make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students because then that's just the same thing.  I wouldn't friend my residents because, frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out and drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook.  Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it.  It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection.  Um, not really.",
            "I think the war has been dragged out for too long. \nI believe the initial intention was good. \nHowever, I think we've lost sight of that intention a long time ago. \nWe're just maybe doing it to prove that we're a superpower in the world. \nI just think the initial motives were questionable, related to George Bush's father's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the original intention was to give democracy to a country without a fair political system, I think that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal issues involved, I don't think it would be fair. \nBut I think it's been dragged out for too long. \nIf our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. \nHowever, I don't think our reasons have been deteriorated and misconceived over time. \nIt seems like we're still at war just for the sake of war, and we don't want to end this thing without a decisive victory or conclusion. \nI think it's gone on long enough, and it should stop. \nTheir government and officials will have to fend for themselves eventually. \nI think that time has come. \nWe've been draining our economy for a long time, spending billions of dollars, while we have our own wars, such as poverty and other issues, that we should be addressing. \nI think it's a heavy burden on our economy, as the purpose has been stretched to absurdity. \nThey're spending billions and billions of dollars. \nWar shouldn't be in our long-term budget. \nThere are obviously issues like poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, etc. \nWe have a lot of problems that need to be solved, such as healthcare, which I think could be better spent on. \nRight now, that money is being spent to have some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the reason for.",
            "I'd like to clarify one thing, but I'm not sure if it's relevant. It's just that someone was online and they found out some stuff. I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, but on sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's basically public. And on Myspace, if you want to see someone's profile, you have to be their friend or have someone else be your friend so that you can see it. So, if you're friends with someone, you've given them permission to see your profile. So, when you put information online, you have to know that a lot of people are going to see that. And I think it's actually good that someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's tough because you can't have someone just sitting around all day looking at everyone's profiles to prevent something bad from happening. But then it becomes some kind of discrimination if they're only looking at the bad kids. I don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it all depends on the situation - maybe they were just randomly browsing and happened to see it, or maybe they were actually looking for evidence of something. So, I'm not really sure.\n\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw a news report about a guy who was trying to show how easy it was to get information online. He went onto someone's profile and got their screen name right away, and then talked to them on instant messenger and got them to meet him in under a minute. I personally wouldn't agree to meet someone I didn't know, but I've had people in my class who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know it's me. It's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like, and sometimes if you post your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, and they know a lot about you, including photos. I try to limit what I post, but at the same time, the whole point of having one is to be able to communicate with my friends, so I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, but you never really know who can see what.\n\nUh, yeah, I've heard that my roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was an issue about students being banned from having Myspace. That seemed a little weird to me, and I wasn't sure how school officials had the right to tell their students they couldn't have Myspace. I'm not even sure if that's a privacy issue, but I don't really know how they had the right to do that.\n\nThat's the only other thought I have.\n\nYes.",
            "Hmm, we only have this and then one more time that I need to talk about the Iraq War. Yeah, I feel hypocritical talking about it, I mean I hate to say you know I hate to join the bandwagon of people that are like oh I was against it from the beginning. I was but like it’s not really important anymore because just the general consensus everywhere was that it was a bad idea except within the administration because they don’t want to admit that they were wrong. And, I mean you just have to look at like the recent polls. They've done United States polls, they've done Iraqi polls, they've done global polls. And, I mean no, about seventy-five to eighty percent of the population of the world thinks that it was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqis, seventy percent of the troops that are over there, like the U.S. troops that are over there right now think it was a dumb idea and that we should pull out within the year. I don’t know, it’s just been a complete disaster from before we even came in. It was already a disaster and now pulling out is also going to be a disaster. There's really no easy way to go about really anything involving the Middle East anymore. I mean I think it's just the culture clash between like the United States and the Middle Eastern states. I mean it’s just too big a gap and for like this administration to understand or previous administrations and they think that they can just like bring democracy into an area where it shouldn’t exist. Like that's not the way that this totally different group of people would choose to run their lives. I mean sure Saddam was a bad guy, I don’t think anyone’s like arguing that he’s not. But, I mean you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that’s going to turn into just a complete disaster just like quicksand from when we went over there. I don’t even know what to say about it. I don't really see a reason at all to stay in there. I mean I’m sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it’s better to stay in there and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out, I don’t agree with them. I’ve yet to hear like a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn’t really have a problem with that. But, I just don’t see a reason why we shouldn’t just leave now. I mean I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these, these are the people that we’re trying to save, like that we’re trying to help, telling us to leave. You know I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes then you know it’s not on us if something happens, you know if it completely goes to shit we could be like well we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we’ll mean if we decide to help out after that we’ll at least be the good guys, kind of not really, no we’ll never be the good guys in the Middle East but you know it’ll be better than you know where we are, where we stand right now. Yeah, uh, no",
            "We feel that there's still a problem of gender discrimination in the United States. I think it's not just a women's issue. Different fields of work have different levels of gender discrimination. I feel that women face more difficulties in many areas. For example, even in a society that strives for equality, many people find it hard to accept women as their superiors. This is because society's attitude towards women has been shaped over time. If a woman has the qualifications for a certain position, but her superiors still won't promote her due to a historical lack of women in top business positions, that's a problem. The same thing happens to men, especially in industries like fashion. Generally, men don't stay home to take care of the kids, and society mocks this choice. People think that men should be the primary breadwinner, not stay home to take care of the kids. However, in some cases, it's the opposite – the wife has a better job, and the husband stays home to take care of the kids, yet society still mocks this choice.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people don't take men seriously. They think that if a man is into fashion, he's somehow different from women. They assume that men who are into fashion must have different tastes or lifestyles, and that they can't truly understand women's needs. They think that other men are different, and that they can't possibly understand women's needs. This is why people are discriminated against based on where they're from or their gender. Changing this is difficult because society has formed its own set of stereotypes. We've made a lot of progress, especially with women rising to top business positions and becoming CEOs, but change is slow. If we continue at our current pace, women will keep rising to the top, and people will start to accept this. Similarly, men staying home to take care of the kids is becoming more accepted because people are starting to realize that women might have better jobs. People in the fashion industry are also starting to realize that people's needs might not be what they think they are. So, we need to promote the qualities of people who are often discriminated against without being too pushy. If you try to force it, people will resist. If we're doing everything we can already, we don't need to do anything else because if we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. We've made a lot of progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's also possible that our society will discriminate against you because of where you're from or your gender. For example, if you're from a rural area and your grammar isn't great, but you're extremely intelligent, and you work your way up to be a CEO, other men might look down on you and think, \"How do I know you're really saying what you mean if you can't even put together a sentence?\" Or if you're intelligent but your grammar isn't great, other men might look down on you. So, our society might discriminate against you because of your gender and where you're from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't abolish it. They decriminalized it. Um, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge, at least for a marijuana charge. One thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, I mean so, when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for then. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open-minded, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on, you know, food programs for the homeless people. Um, I mean so, I think it's, it's important, I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff, um, I mean for a variety of reasons. But there's this whole like financial element to it as well, other reasons like? Why it shouldn't necessarily be totally legalized, well no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and um, it still is like taboo in our society, in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, and, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low, um, I don't really know, um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle, as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills, I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean they, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance, when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects, um yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I would say yes because many of the things they do are very traditional, like they've been doing the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to adapt to change. I think many Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and are very strict about how things are done, and look down on those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. They don't accept people who aren't strict Catholics, and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example, my parents were both Episcopalian, but my mom was Catholic, and they wouldn't get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThat's not really being tolerant of other religions. We were always taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching, but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like many Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the Catholic practice goes against it because it's outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would influence their behavior. I personally think it would be a good idea, but I don't think it would necessarily deter them from doing pedophilic behavior. It's a different realm, you know? It might, but I probably don't think that would be an issue.\n\nWell, I guess people who molest children will probably do it regardless of whether they're married or not, because a child is different from a spouse, you know? So if you're going to do something like that, you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married. I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening; I think that would probably happen regardless.",
            "This problem I still haven't made up my mind on. So I can't say right or wrong on either side. But I think this is the most complex issue we're dealing with today. Because the separation of church and state and how to define marriage is a headache. Because any definition will make some people unhappy. So I don't know, I think all civil unions don't necessarily have to be defined as marriage by the government. And since it's a religious ceremony, if you get married, you'll get tax breaks, or the government will consider you a special type. So if you get married, I think the government should just consider it a civil union because that's what it is, it's just two people. They shouldn't separate church and state, they shouldn't consider what kind of marriage it is, two people are combined. And also, same-sex marriage, I mean, it's just a civil union. Um, if all the states can reach a logical conclusion, they should push to make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is just ridiculous. Because the constitution shouldn't be amended for some minor matters. I mean, it's a big deal for some people, but it's not big enough to be a constitutional amendment. It's not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban same-sex marriage, to put it simply. Uh, no.",

            "Okay, well, the war, um, at first I was all for it because I was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. \nI think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run. \nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. \nI really think that it backfired on us. \nI don’t know, I was all for it, but now I’m very against it. \nI don’t think it did anything. \nI think the people over there, as long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well. \nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re unable to get along with themselves. \nUnfortunately, because of nine eleven, I’ve almost just lost interest in what goes on over there. \nWith those people, I just don’t care. \nI just think they’re not human. \nI don’t know, like they fight with each other and they can’t do anything themselves. \nSo, I really don’t care. \nI don’t know, we definitely went over there just unprepared. \nWe didn’t know what we were gonna face over there. \nIt’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us. \nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country. \nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there. \nAnd I think that should be fine for us. \nI think we should just leave and that’s really it. \nWe just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything. \nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and, um, also their whole culture. \nI just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened. \nAnd, um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. \nBut at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it. \nSo, I don’t think we could have let it go. \nBut I think we could have had a better plan of what we were gonna do in terms of I guess like creating order and, um, stability. \nAnd I don’t know, I just think that they didn’t have, there was no unity. \nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for. \nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more. \nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that’s what we created in turn in there. \nHonestly, I don’t think we’re the ones to change those people. \nHonestly, I think they’re always going to be like that. \nAnd, um, I don’t, I really don’t have anything else to say. \nIt’s gone on long enough. \nI don’t think we’re making enough progress. \nWe’ve made progress, but not enough to stay in there. \nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it’s just gonna collapse. \nAnd we can’t stay over there forever. \nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there. \nNo, okay."
