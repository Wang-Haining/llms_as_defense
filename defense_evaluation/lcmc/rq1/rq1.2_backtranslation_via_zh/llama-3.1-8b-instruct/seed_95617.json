            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change. They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't object to same-sex marriage. Well, I think it's not a conscious choice, whether you're born that way or whatever. I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but not two people of the same sex. It seems like it's not a choice, like they don't have a choice in how they are. I was born straight, and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I don't think they should be judged or put on a stage, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives, and that's just who they are - like they were born that way or at least that's what I think. And I think they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can be in the room with you if you're sick and can visit. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Okay, so first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer you know. Even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean there are a bunch of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And they're controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things as well, it's a tough one. I'd say not. You could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, I mean people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. Nope",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nI think now it's not as strict as it used to be.\nI remember that when I was younger, I went to church every Sunday.\nI would wear cute little dresses, \nmatching shoes, \nand a matching purse, \nThis was my time in private school, \nI would meet my friends on weekends, \nWe would just go, \nBut now as I've grown older, they've made like a teenager's mass, \nThey shortened it to 30 minutes, \nPeople dress more casually, \nEspecially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach, \nYou'll see families running late, \nI think it's become more casual, \nEven at morning masses where I used to dress up, \nPeople wear jeans and khakis, \nOh, khakis are nice too, \nBut it's a lot more casual compared to that, \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed, \nThat's the church I know, \nI don't know the politics of the church and whatnot, \nBut yes, \n[Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nI don't think these things could have been avoided, \nBecause, \nThere are men who are married, \nAnd they still become pedophiles, \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids, \nSo, \nI think even if they got married, it's just the person, \nIt's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married, \nI think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest, \nUh, \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, like in Seventh Heaven, \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something, \n[Mm hmm]\nThey're allowed to get married, \nSo, \nI know it's a little different, \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith, \n[Can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?]\nUh, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Uh]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUh, \nI think, \nLike the whole \nUh, \nSexuality before \nAbout being genetic \nI think it's based on genetics, \nI don't think people \nUh, \nJust become it, \nI think they're born that way, \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up, \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, \nBut \nI think it's their genetics, \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage, \nYou could try, \nBut \nThen it would usually come out, \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening, \nUh, \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew, \n[Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUh, no",
            "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood feud against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think in the long run, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. (um) I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long run, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um... Oh I can't remember his name, the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Moqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious, radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I feel like this war is pointless because it's not even a declared war actually. I think it was just a big revenge thing because that's who we thought did the 9/11 attacks. I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't know the details of it, but I think we're just staying there to try and build democracy so it can be like the U.S. and also to get oil and stuff from them. But there's no reason to stay there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. It's hard to say I want them to stay in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States, which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like we're just going to make the Al-Kaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. They've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years. I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took their home and their stuff and now they don't have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because I don't think that there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by Congress and then it's and I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them but it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember the whole Vietnam thing the Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so I think it's a half an hour don't you?",
            "I don't really think it's reasonable to make it a law or for the government to decide it's legal. I think it should be up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear that it's written in the constitution. Trying to use power to enforce it would be in defiance of what's already written in stone in the constitution. So, I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs against another. Because we can see that most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some other areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches are allowed to make illegal and legal. And well, the separation of church and state is a very key aspect of the constitution, which is what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to make an amendment, I think it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already written there. And also, I think it would be one of the only amendments that restrict the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right at all in that aspect.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nNot quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, the war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. It's all about the money and controlling resources. I mean, another one of the predispositions before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet, places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, but we're not making any attacks against them. So, I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. Let's see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm, I've always been for gay marriage. I think it's a personal preference and uh, it's been proven that it's more biological than sociological, so we shouldn't take away their rights due to something they can't control. It's just not humane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics and government should have a say in this, because it's not a national issue, it's a personal issue and a family issue. You know, in my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. You know, they're just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would. And I think if Bush tries to play God here and interpret the meaning of marriage, it's just ridiculous. \n\nOf course, yeah. I mean I think, I believe I've read and heard from numerous different uh publications and TV reports or newspapers and stuff that it's a chemical thing that's proved they might be predisposed to be homosexual. It's not something about growing up with four sisters and being the only brother and not having a father that has anything to do with it. So that's the biological side, not the sociological side. \n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone, just run off to Las Vegas and get married, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times, you know? I think it's just a personal, private matter that should be left to the individual, not a public or national issue. \n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. As an R.A. I've already dealt with this before. When you put something out there, it will influence people's opinions of you. If you're talking about explosions or shootings, someone will say something. You can't put that out there. Put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin. Someone went to the school and told them. They have to take action. If something doesn't happen, they can prevent it. Then again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just joking around. Like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. It could be a social network experiment, like a lab experiment. When you put something on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't tell them. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them. And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",
            "I think this war has been dragged out for too long. I think the initial goal was good. I think it was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that goal. Now we're just maybe fighting to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation was related to George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think if it was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would be fair. But I think the war has already dragged on for too long. I think we conveyed our message in the first couple of months, starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. However, the fact that it has continued for over a year or several years, I think that's too long.\n\nYes, I think... I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think... I think our reason has deteriorated and been misconstrued. It seems like we're still at war just for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to end this without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYes, I do think it has gone on long enough and should stop. I think the government and their officials will eventually have to fend for themselves anyway. I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war, while we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think this is a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been dragged out.\n\nYes, I mean we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. We have many problems, such as poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, and so on. We have many problems that need funding. Our healthcare should get more funding. Right now, that money is being spent on having some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification question. Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "It's like a totally different group of people's way of living. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy; no one's arguing that he wasn't. But, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand, from the moment we went over there. I mean, it's not like we can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. That's not the way that totally different groups of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out; I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still sexism in the United States. It's not just about women; I think it's about the specific field of work you're in. I believe women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even with the theory of equality, many people still have a hard time accepting female leaders. This is because society has had a preconceived notion for a long time. Therefore, women often find themselves qualified for a job, but are rejected, because people think women shouldn't be in high positions. Similarly, men face similar challenges in certain fields, such as fashion and childcare. Usually, the parent is the woman, and the man is expected to be the breadwinner. If a man chooses to stay home and care for the children, society looks down on them: \"You should be the one earning money for the family.\" This puts a lot of pressure on them, as they may have originally wanted to be the primary caregivers, while their wives have better jobs. And in the fashion industry, people will doubt a man's authenticity: \"You're not a true fashion enthusiast; your style doesn't fit the industry standards.\" People question his professionalism, worrying he can't understand women's needs. This also relates to geographical background, because some people may have regional cultural biases against women or men. To change this, we need to gradually promote understanding and acceptance of different groups. We need to avoid forced promotion and instead showcase their strengths and abilities. If we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. So, we need to gradually push for this change, allowing people to slowly accept it. We've made great progress, and change takes time. Actually, besides sexism, geographical background can also lead to other forms of discrimination.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they just decriminalized it, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there's an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them, like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open liberal track, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean, so I think it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like why it shouldn't necessarily be, well, no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know. I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I'd say yes it's because a lot of what they do is very traditional like they've done the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their like pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm maybe but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless.

            "I was actually raised in a Christian home so to speak, homosexuality is a kind of gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. Um, I think I don't completely agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be determined by each state rather than the country as a whole. Um, many states are democratic, many states are republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know the state's stance on this issue. Um, I don't think you have the right to disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage because you chose to live there, you know. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it. Um, I've already answered that. But, uh, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide whether the whole country should oppose gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. I just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Um, so I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I, uh, no, I don't agree at all. I think about it, let me see, in my opinion, MySpace is a public place, and a bulletin, you know, if you look at that definition, then you know, it's basically for the public and others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here, like, uh, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know, students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, but, um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",
            "I was completely for it at first because I was affected by 9/11 personally. I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change. They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't object to same-sex marriage. Well, I think it's not a conscious choice, whether you're born that way or whatever. I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but not two people of the same sex. It seems like it's not a choice, like they don't have a choice in how they are. I was born straight, and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I don't think they should be judged or put on a stage, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives, and that's just who they are - like they were born that way or at least that's what I think. And I think they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can be in the room with you if you're sick and can visit. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Okay, so first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer you know. Even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean there are a bunch of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And they're controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things as well, it's a tough one. I'd say not. You could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, I mean people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. Nope",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nI think now it's not as strict as it used to be.\nI remember that when I was younger, I went to church every Sunday.\nI would wear cute little dresses, \nmatching shoes, \nand a matching purse, \nThis was my time in private school, \nI would meet my friends on weekends, \nWe would just go, \nBut now as I've grown older, they've made like a teenager's mass, \nThey shortened it to 30 minutes, \nPeople dress more casually, \nEspecially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach, \nYou'll see families running late, \nI think it's become more casual, \nEven at morning masses where I used to dress up, \nPeople wear jeans and khakis, \nOh, khakis are nice too, \nBut it's a lot more casual compared to that, \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed, \nThat's the church I know, \nI don't know the politics of the church and whatnot, \nBut yes, \n[Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nI don't think these things could have been avoided, \nBecause, \nThere are men who are married, \nAnd they still become pedophiles, \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids, \nSo, \nI think even if they got married, it's just the person, \nIt's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married, \nI think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest, \nUh, \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, like in Seventh Heaven, \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something, \n[Mm hmm]\nThey're allowed to get married, \nSo, \nI know it's a little different, \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith, \n[Can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?]\nUh, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Uh]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUh, \nI think, \nLike the whole \nUh, \nSexuality before \nAbout being genetic \nI think it's based on genetics, \nI don't think people \nUh, \nJust become it, \nI think they're born that way, \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up, \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, \nBut \nI think it's their genetics, \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage, \nYou could try, \nBut \nThen it would usually come out, \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening, \nUh, \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew, \n[Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUh, no",
            "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood feud against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think in the long run, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. (um) I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long run, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um... Oh I can't remember his name, the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Moqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious, radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I feel like this war is pointless because it's not even a declared war actually. I think it was just a big revenge thing because that's who we thought did the 9/11 attacks. I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't know the details of it, but I think we're just staying there to try and build democracy so it can be like the U.S. and also to get oil and stuff from them. But there's no reason to stay there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. It's hard to say I want them to stay in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States, which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like we're just going to make the Al-Kaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. They've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years. I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took their home and their stuff and now they don't have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because I don't think that there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by Congress and then it's and I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them but it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember the whole Vietnam thing the Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so I think it's a half an hour don't you?",
            "I don't really think it's reasonable to make it a law or for the government to decide it's legal. I think it should be up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear that it's written in the constitution. Trying to use power to enforce it would be in defiance of what's already written in stone in the constitution. So, I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs against another. Because we can see that most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some other areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches are allowed to make illegal and legal. And well, the separation of church and state is a very key aspect of the constitution, which is what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to make an amendment, I think it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already written there. And also, I think it would be one of the only amendments that restrict the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right at all in that aspect.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nNot quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, the war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. It's all about the money and controlling resources. I mean, another one of the predispositions before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet, places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, but we're not making any attacks against them. So, I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. Let's see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm, I've always been for gay marriage. I think it's a personal preference and uh, it's been proven that it's more biological than sociological, so we shouldn't take away their rights due to something they can't control. It's just not humane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics and government should have a say in this, because it's not a national issue, it's a personal issue and a family issue. You know, in my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. You know, they're just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would. And I think if Bush tries to play God here and interpret the meaning of marriage, it's just ridiculous. \n\nOf course, yeah. I mean I think, I believe I've read and heard from numerous different uh publications and TV reports or newspapers and stuff that it's a chemical thing that's proved they might be predisposed to be homosexual. It's not something about growing up with four sisters and being the only brother and not having a father that has anything to do with it. So that's the biological side, not the sociological side. \n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone, just run off to Las Vegas and get married, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times, you know? I think it's just a personal, private matter that should be left to the individual, not a public or national issue. \n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. As an R.A. I've already dealt with this before. When you put something out there, it will influence people's opinions of you. If you're talking about explosions or shootings, someone will say something. You can't put that out there. Put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin. Someone went to the school and told them. They have to take action. If something doesn't happen, they can prevent it. Then again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just joking around. Like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. It could be a social network experiment, like a lab experiment. When you put something on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't tell them. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them. And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",
            "I think this war has been dragged out for too long. I think the initial goal was good. I think it was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that goal. Now we're just maybe fighting to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation was related to George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think if it was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would be fair. But I think the war has already dragged on for too long. I think we conveyed our message in the first couple of months, starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. However, the fact that it has continued for over a year or several years, I think that's too long.\n\nYes, I think... I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think... I think our reason has deteriorated and been misconstrued. It seems like we're still at war just for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to end this without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYes, I do think it has gone on long enough and should stop. I think the government and their officials will eventually have to fend for themselves anyway. I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war, while we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think this is a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been dragged out.\n\nYes, I mean we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. We have many problems, such as poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, and so on. We have many problems that need funding. Our healthcare should get more funding. Right now, that money is being spent on having some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification question. Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "It's like a totally different group of people's way of living. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy; no one's arguing that he wasn't. But, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand, from the moment we went over there. I mean, it's not like we can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. That's not the way that totally different groups of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out; I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still sexism in the United States. It's not just about women; I think it's about the specific field of work you're in. I believe women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even with the theory of equality, many people still have a hard time accepting female leaders. This is because society has had a preconceived notion for a long time. Therefore, women often find themselves qualified for a job, but are rejected, because people think women shouldn't be in high positions. Similarly, men face similar challenges in certain fields, such as fashion and childcare. Usually, the parent is the woman, and the man is expected to be the breadwinner. If a man chooses to stay home and care for the children, society looks down on them: \"You should be the one earning money for the family.\" This puts a lot of pressure on them, as they may have originally wanted to be the primary caregivers, while their wives have better jobs. And in the fashion industry, people will doubt a man's authenticity: \"You're not a true fashion enthusiast; your style doesn't fit the industry standards.\" People question his professionalism, worrying he can't understand women's needs. This also relates to geographical background, because some people may have regional cultural biases against women or men. To change this, we need to gradually promote understanding and acceptance of different groups. We need to avoid forced promotion and instead showcase their strengths and abilities. If we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. So, we need to gradually push for this change, allowing people to slowly accept it. We've made great progress, and change takes time. Actually, besides sexism, geographical background can also lead to other forms of discrimination.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they just decriminalized it, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there's an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them, like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open liberal track, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean, so I think it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like why it shouldn't necessarily be, well, no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know. I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I'd say yes it's because a lot of what they do is very traditional like they've done the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their like pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm maybe but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",

            "I was actually raised in a Christian home so to speak, homosexuality is a kind of gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. Um, I think I don't completely agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be determined by each state rather than the country as a whole. Um, many states are democratic, many states are republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know the state's stance on this issue. Um, I don't think you have the right to disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage because you chose to live there, you know. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it. Um, I've already answered that. But, uh, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide whether the whole country should oppose gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. I just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Um, so I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I, uh, no, I don't agree at all. I think about it, let me see, in my opinion, MySpace is a public place, and a bulletin, you know, if you look at that definition, then you know, it's basically for the public and others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here, like, uh, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know, students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, but, um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",
            "I was completely for it at first because I was affected by 9/11 personally. I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in some ways the Catholic Church needs to change. They have a lot of views that I think the Catholic Church isn't very accepting of a lot of things, which is why they're losing some of their followers. The Catholic Church has very strong views on things like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which I think is fine, but they're a bit old-fashioned in some ways. So I think if they were to adapt to some newer styles of thinking, they wouldn't be worried about losing their followers. I've heard that a lot of people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a bit because of their views on these issues. Some people are starting to disagree with the Catholic Church on certain subjects, so they feel that the Catholic Church has the wrong views on things. I mean, the Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you're for abortion you might not feel comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and something you were against. It's similar with gay marriage, where if that's something you believe in and want to do or feel strongly about, you might not want to be in a following where they disagree with that. I don't see any reason why they can't have female priests or that priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if that would have necessarily prevented these problems. I don't think it would have changed anything, actually. I don't think they would have done anything differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were female priests. The Catholic Church says that priests are married to God and devoted to their whole life, but I don't see why regular people can't have both a job and a family life, so I don't see why priests can't have both.",
            "I personally don't object to same-sex marriage. Well, I think it's not a conscious choice, whether you're born that way or whatever. I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. So, I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married but not two people of the same sex. It seems like it's not a choice, like they don't have a choice in how they are. I was born straight, and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue, I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue. I don't think they should be judged or put on a stage, like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it has nothing to do with the security of our country, it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that, it just seems like they're out of place. They don't seem to have the right to intervene in people's lives, and that's just who they are - like they were born that way or at least that's what I think. And I think they shouldn't be punished for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized because basically there's not a good reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family, but it's so different. And there are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same. It's just like two different sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but it's like the same thing. There are a lot of civil rights that go along with it, like property taxes and the whole healthcare thing where your primary or your next of kin can be in the room with you if you're sick and can visit. And I think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. And a lot of scientific studies have been done because it's a hot topic these days, and homosexual couples have the same kind of rates of success, they have the same factors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do. It's just it's a relationship, it's the same thing. And I think where a lot of people get hung up is homosexuals aren't asking for the right to get married in a church, they're asking for a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. And if there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue. Because I don't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that's against our religion and that's morally wrong for us and we can't approve of that sort of thing. But in a legal sense, if you're allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage. It's like segregation, separate but unequal. Yeah, they are, they're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that. And people worry about like adoption issues and community issues, like how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community. And especially about, um, children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society and whether or not they'll, um, be influenced by their parent's, um, sexual orientation choices or not. But well again it's kind of new and stuff, but it's kind of hard to say I'm not sure about the children aspect about adoption. Because I think the main drawback to that is, um, how children get treated by their peers and by other adults in society. Like in New York City, I know they um, they have special schools for children of gay parents, because in public schools in New York City they get, um, beaten up. And stuff like that, parents protest to get the child removed from their school, and it's just a kid, I mean, they're gonna have the same points of view and everything, parenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. And so they can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to, I mean it's just about personality choices. I think the federal government should be very involved in this issue, making gay marriage legal in every state, I think the amendment should just be the opposite. But well I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion. Well, his um, his take on gay marriage actually um, I think it goes along with his take on abortion and stem cell research which, um, I think most of the reasons I'm not sure about this, because honestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot, but most of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons, and morality I don't want to say it's negotiable, but it definitely differs from person to person, and to embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and um, morality concepts of all the rest is unethical. To just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account to go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy, considering I mean about um, under god in the pledge of allegiance and how people are so opposed to that, but yet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country. Um, just one, lots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged, and the gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents, or just a personality defect. And that is also not a good reason, because the American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is, and if people listened to um, institutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects instead of listening to their neighbors and their friends and maybe what's popular opinion in their culture in their church then maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently.

            "Okay, so first off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer you know. Even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't mean it has no benefits. So, as for making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely not. But for medical purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's not beneficial. It's not beneficial, you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean there are a bunch of illegal drugs that pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And they're controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial, and if you deny those benefits, just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should accept its beneficial properties, I think. I don't think it's that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, it can lead to bad things, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things as well, it's a tough one. I'd say not. You could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually, but not all at once, because then it would be abused. But if you just remove the taboo around marijuana first, and then people might use it responsibly. Yeah, I mean people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But it's not that bad for you, it's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean if we get rid of the image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes. Nope",
            "I think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nI think now it's not as strict as it used to be.\nI remember that when I was younger, I went to church every Sunday.\nI would wear cute little dresses, \nmatching shoes, \nand a matching purse, \nThis was my time in private school, \nI would meet my friends on weekends, \nWe would just go, \nBut now as I've grown older, they've made like a teenager's mass, \nThey shortened it to 30 minutes, \nPeople dress more casually, \nEspecially in the summer, people come in their beach clothes straight from the beach, \nYou'll see families running late, \nI think it's become more casual, \nEven at morning masses where I used to dress up, \nPeople wear jeans and khakis, \nOh, khakis are nice too, \nBut it's a lot more casual compared to that, \nAs for other things, \nThat's the biggest thing I've noticed, \nThat's the church I know, \nI don't know the politics of the church and whatnot, \nBut yes, \n[Regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nI don't think these things could have been avoided, \nBecause, \nThere are men who are married, \nAnd they still become pedophiles, \nAnd they still have \nUh, \nAn attraction towards young kids, \nSo, \nI think even if they got married, it's just the person, \nIt's not because they're allowed to get married or not allowed to get married, \nI think when they become a priest, it's their choice to become a priest, \nUh, \nThere are religions that allow them to get married, like in Seventh Heaven, \nI don't know what kind of \nHe's a reverend or a minister or something, \n[Mm hmm]\nThey're allowed to get married, \nSo, \nI know it's a little different, \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, then they should maybe think about a different faith, \n[Can you elaborate on your answer a bit more?]\nUh, \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Uh]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn't make a difference, I guess]\nOh, on pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUh, \nI think, \nLike the whole \nUh, \nSexuality before \nAbout being genetic \nI think it's based on genetics, \nI don't think people \nUh, \nJust become it, \nI think they're born that way, \nI don't think it has anything to do with the way they're brought up, \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case, \nBut \nI think it's their genetics, \nAnd you can't hide that through a marriage, \nYou could try, \nBut \nThen it would usually come out, \nSo \nI don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening, \nUh, \nIf they knew about it and were trying to cover it up, then shame on them, \nBut \nI don't think in all cases they knew, \n[Do you have any other thoughts concerning the Catholic Church?]\nUh, no",
            "(laughs) I was just wondering, I was initially okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks and this pretext brought us into Iraq, all sorts of pretexts got us into Iraq. I think early on the Bush administration linked the Iraq War to Osama bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false. And that really rubbed me the wrong way and in general, the Iraq War just boils my blood.\n\n(um) It just seems to me that the Bush administration has been openly lying to the American people and has yet to own up to it. Even Colin Powell, I mean after he came back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't entirely convinced by the evidence at the time, even when he was presenting it. And to me, that's just a dereliction of duty, I think it's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the Constitution and has been trying to erode it since at least 9/11, I mean they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\n(um) That last part... I forgot the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office... But it seems that the younger Bush had a blood feud against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think in the long run, he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it's gone on long enough, I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result. (um) I think the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order, but I don't necessarily know that that's a good idea either, because I think in the long run, it will also cause more problems because Iraq's sovereignty will become an issue, a major issue, because I think it's pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I've heard, it doesn't seem that the Parliament is very effective at all, that um... Oh I can't remember his name, the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what's happening and even Moqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting I guess it was less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we're still dealing with fractious, radical elements who are vying for control of the government and I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\n(laughs) None that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I feel like this war is pointless because it's not even a declared war actually. I think it was just a big revenge thing because that's who we thought did the 9/11 attacks. I'm not a big person on the War on Iraq, so I don't know the details of it, but I think we're just staying there to try and build democracy so it can be like the U.S. and also to get oil and stuff from them. But there's no reason to stay there because it's making everyone upset. And if we stay there, what's going to happen is we have to try and build democracy, which is going to take forever because democracy can't be built in a day. And if we leave, they'll be mad at us because we messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves. It's hard to say I want them to stay in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States, which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like we're just going to make the Al-Kaida thing grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. They've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. So I think this whole thing is going to go on for years and years and years. I guess you could also say that it is hard to say I want the war to end because there's so many families that I know of whose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it's like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like... These people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took their home and their stuff and now they don't have a place to go to school anymore because it's so like unsafe and all these different little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other just because of like the different beliefs that they have. But then again it's like it's hard to say I want them in there but it's like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we're going to be trying more and more to mold them into a second United States which is going to be even worse for them. And it's going to be like I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we're now trying to change them. And they've been going on this whole totalitarian, dictatorship thing for so long that I feel like it's going to hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there. I think the war should continue because it's not fair. I don't think we should call it a war anymore because I don't think that there's a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore. Because like we didn't even call it a war. It shouldn't have even been called a war in the first place because it was never declared by Congress. I think that's how the whole thing works. You have to declare a war by Congress and then it's and I just don't think that it's a real big point to still stay over there and try. Actually no, I do think it's a point to stay over there and try to help them but it's also like wasting our resources. And especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it's like it's making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now because of like what it's doing and it's like and what it's doing to like cause remember the whole Vietnam thing the Vietnam War was like undeclared war and it's now called like a meaningless war and he's like saying he'll be called like that president forever that he started this meaningless war and stuff so I think it's a half an hour don't you?",
            "I don't really think it's reasonable to make it a law or for the government to decide it's legal. I think it should be up to the churches because the constitution even says separation of church and state. It's very clear, it's very clear that it's written in the constitution. Trying to use power to enforce it would be in defiance of what's already written in stone in the constitution. So, I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs against another. Because we can see that most Catholics and Christians are against it and don't support it, except in Boston and some other areas. I don't think it's the government's job to decide what the churches are allowed to make illegal and legal. And well, the separation of church and state is a very key aspect of the constitution, which is what allows for religious tolerance in the United States. Although they planned to make an amendment, I think it would be completely wrong and contradictory to what's already written there. And also, I think it would be one of the only amendments that restrict the people rather than the government. So, I don't think it's right at all in that aspect.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why he's pushing for this amendment, except that it's against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. And, as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion. So, I really think it's up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anybody in government in particular. And there isn't really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it. Because I don't see how it's going to impact the economy or anything else. If anything, it might have a better impact on society than it would not.\n\nNot quite, I think I pretty much said it all.",
            "Okay, the war in Iraq. Well, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war. Before invading Iraq, I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 terrorist attacks when in reality there wasn't much of a connection between the two. However, the government made it seem like there was a connection and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003. Um, I'm against war, especially a preemptive strike, I was against that. And I think the war in Iraq is kind of a repeat of the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from past mistakes that they made with the Vietnam War. I mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died and that's horrible. What they were doing was removing the countries government and I really don't think the government was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur. Um, and the government and so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold or implement democracy. And I think that the government, the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn't going to be a clear victory like it wasn't a clear victory in Vietnam because no matter how many people may have supported the invasion or no matter how many Iraqis may have wanted the US to come in there's going to be a large number of insurgents and it's hard to put them down when you're not fighting an actual army. You're fighting the citizens of the country. So I think that the government, the US government should have planned for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been, I mean, they didn't really plan for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. I mean, we're still there today, almost the end of 2006 and we're still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it's a long process. And I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a short successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn't be naive in thinking that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to have it become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was lots of tension and there was civil war. Um, it's just not an easy thing to do and I think the government, the US government made it seem like it was a relatively easy thing to do. And so, the war in Iraq, well, that's a difficult decision to make because once you go in there and we've been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we're the ones that took away their government and their way of life so how can we abandon them now? So, it's probably something that we should try to see to its finish but again, there's also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we're invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren't we doing this to all these other countries? I think the big reason for that is the oil issue. It's all about the money and controlling resources. I mean, another one of the predispositions before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet, places like North Korea, we actually knew they had weapons of mass destruction, but we're not making any attacks against them. So, I don't think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions. Let's see, um, I just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon but probably not.",
            "Okay, let's see. I'm, I've always been for gay marriage. I think it's a personal preference and uh, it's been proven that it's more biological than sociological, so we shouldn't take away their rights due to something they can't control. It's just not humane. And uh, I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. \n\nI don't think politics and government should have a say in this, because it's not a national issue, it's a personal issue and a family issue. You know, in my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who aren't married because they're not allowed to. You know, they're just like any other family, they walk the dogs down the street like anyone else would. And I think if Bush tries to play God here and interpret the meaning of marriage, it's just ridiculous. \n\nOf course, yeah. I mean I think, I believe I've read and heard from numerous different uh publications and TV reports or newspapers and stuff that it's a chemical thing that's proved they might be predisposed to be homosexual. It's not something about growing up with four sisters and being the only brother and not having a father that has anything to do with it. So that's the biological side, not the sociological side. \n\nWell, other than that, I guess the obvious thing is that if a guy and a girl want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone, just run off to Las Vegas and get married, but if two gay people want to do it, it'll be on the front page of the New York Times, you know? I think it's just a personal, private matter that should be left to the individual, not a public or national issue. \n\nNo, no.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it's a public forum. It's completely public. You can't. As an R.A. I've already dealt with this before. When you put something out there, it will influence people's opinions of you. If you're talking about explosions or shootings, someone will say something. You can't put that out there. Put it out to the world. The internet is seen by everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you'll get their bulletin. Obviously, it wasn't the school that sent the bulletin. Someone went to the school and told them. They have to take action. If something doesn't happen, they can prevent it. Then again, you don't know what to take seriously because some people are just joking around. Like the situation we had at school, it could be an experiment that went terribly wrong for a sociology class. It could be a social network experiment, like a lab experiment. When you put something on the internet, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. If you don't want someone to think something about you, you can't tell them. You can't tell people what to take seriously or not. I don't think school officials should be friending their students on Myspace and Facebook and stalking them. And going through their Facebooks and Myspaces and all those things and Xangas and Live Journals. But if it's brought to the attention of the school officials, then there's no invasion of privacy there. And if there's danger, they have to take it seriously. Like I said, I don't think they should be monitoring phone conversations and texts and IMs. If it's brought to their attention, then it's something completely different. Uh, yeah, don't. Like a teacher shouldn't make a Facebook or a Myspace account under a different name and friend their students. That's the same thing. I wouldn't friend my residents because frankly, I don't want to know if they're going out drinking and then posting their pictures on Facebook. Then that pops up and I have to see that and I have to do something about it. It's not my place, so I don't even want that connection there. Uh, not really.",
            "I think this war has been dragged out for too long. I think the initial goal was good. I think it was to restore democracy in another country. But I think we've long since lost sight of that goal. Now we're just maybe fighting to prove that we're some sort of superpower in the world. I think the original motivation was related to George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. So I think if it was to give democracy to a country that didn't have a fair political system, then that would be a fair motivation, but if there were personal matters involved, I don't think it would be fair. But I think the war has already dragged on for too long. I think we conveyed our message in the first couple of months, starting the war, I think that was a statement in itself. However, the fact that it has continued for over a year or several years, I think that's too long.\n\nYes, I think... I mean if our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I think that's a just purpose and a good reason for the war. But I don't think... I think our reason has deteriorated and been misconstrued. It seems like we're still at war just for the sake of going to war, and we don't want to end this without a decisive victory or something. \n\nYes, I do think it has gone on long enough and should stop. I think the government and their officials will eventually have to fend for themselves anyway. I think that time has come. We've long since been draining our own economy, spending billions of dollars on this war, while we have our own wars on our own turf, such as poverty and so on, that we should be spending that money on. I think this is a drain on our economy for a purpose that's long since been dragged out.\n\nYes, I mean we're spending billions and billions of dollars, and war shouldn't be in our long-term budget. We have many problems, such as poverty, internal improvements, public roads, schools, and so on. We have many problems that need funding. Our healthcare should get more funding. Right now, that money is being spent on having some of our citizens killed in a foreign country at a war that we've lost the cause for.\n\nI think that's it.",
            "I'd like to ask a clarification question. Uh, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was like some activity happening. O, okay, um, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy. Like on a site such as Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see. And I understand on Myspace, you know you have to have someone else be a member in order to see someone's profile, you might need to know them or something like that, but if that's the case, you've accepted that person as your \"friend\" so they can see it, you're giving them permission to see your profile. So, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that, so if I think that was actually good, that someone saw it and was able to prevent a life from being lost. Hmm, um, that's tough because I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that, but then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything,\" um, I mean, I don't think it would really be right to go and have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles, but I guess it all depends on like what situation they came across that profile or was someone just randomly looking at people's and just randomly happened to see that or were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something, so I don't really know. Sure, um, well, um, like I mean I don't have a Myspace but I have a Facebook, I do, it bothers me that I know that there are creepy people out there who can see things about me, and I saw something on TV once that was about this, um, this man who just was just trying to prove how he can get information so easily and he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him, and I mean, personally I certainly wouldn't meet with someone but I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me, and it's hard because you think that they know your interests, they know what you look like, sometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you, all sorts of photos, and I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends, I don't want to limit it too much, so it's a tricky issue because I only accept people I know, I mean you never know really who can look at what, so. Hmm, uh, well, I heard my roommate was telling me that her high school she was there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school, and that struck me as a little bit strange, like I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students that they weren't allowed to have a Myspace, and I don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think I don't really know how they had the right to tell people, that's the only other thought I can think of. Yes.",
            "It's like a totally different group of people's way of living. I mean, sure, Saddam was a bad guy; no one's arguing that he wasn't. But, you have to weigh the pros and cons before you invade a country that's going to turn into just a complete disaster, like quicksand, from the moment we went over there. I mean, it's not like we can just bring democracy into an area where it shouldn't exist. That's not the way that totally different groups of people would choose to run their lives. I mean, I'm sure the administration is thinking some hopeful ideas as to why it's better to stay in there, and you know the problems that might arise from us pulling out; I don't agree with them. I've yet to hear a legitimate reason why we should stay in any longer than we should. I mean, if they want to do it gradually over the course of a year or maybe a little longer than a year, I guess I wouldn't really have a problem with that. But, I just don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now. I mean, I read this statistic a little while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them think that we should just leave now. And like these are the people that we're trying to save, like we're trying to help telling us to leave. I mean, I think they might know better than that. And at least if we ask them should we leave and they say yes, then you know it's not on us if something happens. You know, if it completely goes to shit, we could be like, well, we were going to stay in but you guys made the decision not to. And then you know at least we'll be the good guys, kind of. Not really, no. We'll never be the good guys in the Middle East. But, you know, it'll be better than where we stand right now.",
            "I think there is still sexism in the United States. It's not just about women; I think it's about the specific field of work you're in. I believe women face more difficulties in certain fields because, even with the theory of equality, many people still have a hard time accepting female leaders. This is because society has had a preconceived notion for a long time. Therefore, women often find themselves qualified for a job, but are rejected, because people think women shouldn't be in high positions. Similarly, men face similar challenges in certain fields, such as fashion and childcare. Usually, the parent is the woman, and the man is expected to be the breadwinner. If a man chooses to stay home and care for the children, society looks down on them: \"You should be the one earning money for the family.\" This puts a lot of pressure on them, as they may have originally wanted to be the primary caregivers, while their wives have better jobs. And in the fashion industry, people will doubt a man's authenticity: \"You're not a true fashion enthusiast; your style doesn't fit the industry standards.\" People question his professionalism, worrying he can't understand women's needs. This also relates to geographical background, because some people may have regional cultural biases against women or men. To change this, we need to gradually promote understanding and acceptance of different groups. We need to avoid forced promotion and instead showcase their strengths and abilities. If we do it too quickly, people will resist the change. So, we need to gradually push for this change, allowing people to slowly accept it. We've made great progress, and change takes time. Actually, besides sexism, geographical background can also lead to other forms of discrimination.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they just decriminalized it, which knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of like a traffic ticket, something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that. And I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it, then you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that, the types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would. I mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge. At least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications, and those don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. But at the same time, there's an argument that it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them, and to house them and then to let them go, and then it costs a lot to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times, and then appoint a public defender, and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney's office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And, I mean, so when you're looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren't willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them, like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don't want to do that. But in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open liberal track, I think it's totally fine, and I'm sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, that they can spend on social programs for the elderly, and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people. I mean, so I think it's important because I mean marijuana isn't something that you just want out and out to be everywhere all over the streets and stuff. I mean for a variety of reasons, but there's this whole like financial element to it as well. Other reasons like why it shouldn't necessarily be, well, no, I mean I, I don't know how I would feel about, well, because if it were totally like legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere, then I mean, I guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving, and it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts, uh, to smoke marijuana, so to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. And, sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don't really know. I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they, they both have their adverse effects, and I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way, I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go all out with everything they have, and then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don't, so it, I guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently, but I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no I don't.",
            "I'd say yes it's because a lot of what they do is very traditional like they've done the same things for a long time and it's good to be rooted in tradition but it's also important to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they have to go to church every week and they're very strict on how things are done and sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee and they don't accept people who aren't exactly perfect Catholics and they also don't accept people of other religions. For example my mom was an Episcopalian no I'm sorry my dad was an Episcopalian my mom was a Catholic and they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. And that's not really like being tolerant of other religions we always learned to love others that's a Catholic teaching but it's hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in a way like that so I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it's so outdated but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don't think that would necessarily influence it I mean I personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry but as I don't think that would necessarily deter them from their like pedophilic behavior so because it's just a different realm maybe but I probably don't think that would be an issue. Well I guess like people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not because it's a child which is different than a spouse so if you're going to do something like that you're probably going to do it whether or not you're married like I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening I think that would probably happen regardless. Nope",

            "I was actually raised in a Christian home so to speak, homosexuality is a kind of gray area for me. Because I have many gay friends. Um, I think I don't completely agree with this lifestyle. But I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. However, I think it should be determined by each state rather than the country as a whole. Um, many states are democratic, many states are republican. Obviously, democratic states will advocate for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know the state's stance on this issue. Um, I don't think you have the right to disagree with the state's decision to legalize gay marriage because you chose to live there, you know. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. So I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize it. Um, I've already answered that. But, uh, I don't think Bush should be allowed to decide whether the whole country should oppose gay marriage. I think it should be up to individual states to decide whether to legalize it. I disagree with his ban on it. I just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state should run itself. Um, so I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus he'll be out of office in about two years, and if a Democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they will have to live with the decision, not the president. No, I don't.",
            "I, uh, no, I don't agree at all. I think about it, let me see, in my opinion, MySpace is a public place, and a bulletin, you know, if you look at that definition, then you know, it's basically for the public and others to see, or whatever you're trying to get at. And now if you post that on the internet, you know, you have to realize that people will see it, whether it be school officials or not. So in my opinion, I think school officials seeing that they had every right to see it, because even if they weren't doing it underneath the school's name, they could have still accessed that through their homes. But uh, yeah, with something preventing a school shooting, you know, as long as it saves the lives of students, which is a responsibility of the school system, I think that's perfectly fine. Um, let me see here, like, uh, you know, if they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if you know, students are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they're not supposed to be doing, they go on there just specifically to catch students, and to get them in trouble, and I feel as though that is an invasion of privacy, but, um, I feel as though, you know, as long as they save you know, save lives or make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that that's an invasion at all. Um, should I elaborate more on that? \n\nYes, uh, alright, well, um, hmm, it's a lot easier to express yourself, um, a lot longer when you're writing, but, alright, well, um, like what I was saying, it is a public thing, um, and with a student posting something on Myspace, and not expecting to get in trouble, that's ridiculous, um, everything, like I'm uh, worried to post stuff like even through emails, um, like if I have something not good about somebody to say I don't ever say that on an email because I'm afraid somebody somehow will pick that up, and you know, everything like, everything nowadays comes back, and you know, bites you in the butt, I guess you could say. \n\nUm, like, you know, if you do something while you're a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow, and, like, once it's on the internet it's always on the internet, and, um, you know, if you do something like that there's no way of getting out of it, you will get in trouble, and I don't, it wasn't an invasion at all of privacy, because, you know, like I said before, and, well, that's basically all I've been saying was it's a public thing, and, um, I don't know, let's see here. \n\nUm, like I had said before I don't feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students, but, if they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place, um, then I feel as though that's perfectly fine for them, or, um, other officials such as the police to go on, um, you know, when parents drop their students off at school they feel as though, you know, they're dropping them off at a safe place, I've actually discussed that with a, um, a teacher of mine, I went to a public high school, and, um, they say, you know, we have to ensure stuff like this, because, like, we would do like lock downs, and stuff, and, um, that's like in reference to the terrorist attacks, uh, we had to be safe about that, we had like drill stuff, and, even though that doesn't have anything to do with the, well, I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting, because, um, that was in case people would come into the building I guess, um, so we, you know, we did practice that stuff, um, in order to make the school a safer place, and, that's just what the school officials were doing in this case, they were just making it a safer place, um, preventing anything bad from happening, like, Columbine or something like that, um, yeah that's basically all I can come up with. \n\nUh, no, that's about it",
            "I was completely for it at first because I was affected by 9/11 personally. I was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here. I think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened, I think we overlooked a lot of things and didn't really think about the long run. We kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan. And I really think that it backfired on us. I uh, I don't know. I was all for it, but now I'm very against it. I don't think it did anything. I think the people over there, as long as they're fighting with each other, they can't be fighting with us as well. Like I don't think us being over there is gonna do anything if they're, if they can't even get along with themselves. So um, like unfortunately because of 9/11 I've almost just, I just don't care about what goes on over there. I just don't care, I just think they're not human, they fight with each other and they can't, they just can't do anything themselves. So I really don't care. Um, I don't know. We definitely went over there just unprepared, we didn't know like what we were gonna face over there. And it's also bad because war for them is very different than war for us, they're just like savage people when it comes to war, and I don't think they're looking to better their country, I just think they're looking to get us out of there. And I think that should be fine for us, I think we should just leave and that's really it. Um, we just, I think we were just more like, just hyped up than anything, I don't think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and um, I just, we pretty much just went over there looking for revenge, I think, and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened, and um, also I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq. Um, but at the time I see where he was coming from, we really, I don't think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can't just do that and then us just say okay let's rebuild and that's it. So um, I don't think we could have let it go, but I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do, I don't think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of, I guess like creating order, and I don't know, I just think that they didn't have a plan, there was no, no like unity, they didn't know what they were going in there for, so I think that would have helped us out a lot more. But like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with, so that's what we created in turn in there. Um, and honestly I don't, I don't think we're the ones to change those people, I honestly think they're always going to be like that, and um, I don't, I really don't have anything else to say, it's gone on for definitely long enough, um, I don't think we're making enough progress, like we've made progress, but not enough to stay in there, and I think no matter how long we stay in there, once we leave, it's just gonna collapse, and we can't stay over there forever, so I think we're just hurting ourselves by staying over there, no."
