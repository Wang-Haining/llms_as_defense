            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on several issues in order to prevent a decline in its following. One possible reason for this decline is the church's rigidity on certain topics, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated by some. By adapting to a more modern perspective, the church may be able to retain its followers who feel alienated by its conservative views. \n\nMany people are beginning to question the Catholic Church's stance on these issues and may choose not to follow the church if they disagree with its teachings. For instance, individuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable belonging to a community that views these practices as morally wrong. Similarly, people who value personal freedom and autonomy may be put off by the church's strict views on these matters.\n\nThe Catholic Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is another area where some may see the institution as out of touch. It's hard to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have prevented past scandals, but it's clear that these issues are not necessarily linked. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to question why the church bars priests from marrying and having a family life, especially when many other professionals are able to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nThe church's argument that priests are married to God and devoted to their spiritual calling doesn't necessarily justify its stance on marriage and family life. In reality, most people have multiple commitments and responsibilities, and it's not unreasonable to expect priests to have a similar balance in their lives.",
            "Personally, I don't object to same-sex marriage. It's my opinion that people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, so it's unfair to hold them accountable for it. Therefore, I believe it's wrong to deny marriage rights to couples of the same sex while allowing heterosexual couples to marry. I haven't given much thought to the issue, but I firmly believe that this discrimination is unjust.\n\nIt seems that sexual orientation isn't a matter of personal choice, as people are born with their natural inclinations. I was born straight, and others are born gay – it's just a natural aspect of who they are. I don't think they should be blamed or held accountable for their orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's a personal matter that doesn't concern the government. I don't think it's right for them to intervene in people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal relationships and identities.\n\nUltimately, people should be free to be who they are without fear of persecution or judgment. The government's involvement in this issue seems out of place and unnecessary. Gay people are not responsible for their orientation, and they shouldn't be punished for it. They should be treated with respect and equality, just like anyone else.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people think that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but they are simply two different sides of the same coin, with their own unique characteristics. The notion that gay couples are a threat is unfounded and lacks evidence. \n\nResearch has shown that gay couples fare similarly to straight couples in terms of relationship satisfaction, and they have the same fundamental needs and desires. They're not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather for a legal document that acknowledges their union, which is a civil matter, not a religious one. \n\nThe argument that allowing gay marriage would lead to the erosion of traditional values is a weak one. It's similar to saying that civil rights for African Americans or women would lead to the downfall of society. The idea that gay people are morally flawed or that their sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception that has been disproven by scientific studies. \n\nThe opposition to gay marriage is often rooted in ignorance and a lack of understanding. People's moral compasses may vary, but it's unfair to impose one group's morality on the entire country. Moreover, it's hypocritical for politicians to push for laws that enforce their own moral standards without considering the perspectives of others.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a choice. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. It's essential to rely on research and evidence rather than anecdotal opinions or popular culture.\n\nUltimately, I think the federal government should take a more progressive stance on this issue and legalize gay marriage across the country. The idea that the government should intervene in personal relationships and dictate who can or cannot get married is a flawed one. It's time for us to move forward and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "To clarify my stance on the availability of certain substances, I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand the benefits of using controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, which are often misunderstood due to their legal status. Conversely, I believe that just because marijuana is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it lacks beneficial properties. In fact, if its medicinal uses are acknowledged, it could be a valuable treatment option for patients.\n\nWhile it's true that abusing any substance can lead to negative consequences, the comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely accurate. However, a more gradual introduction of marijuana into the legal system might mitigate potential abuse. The primary issue lies in the stigma surrounding marijuana, which is often fueled by its illegality. By reevaluating this stigma and understanding that marijuana is not as detrimental as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine, we may be able to encourage responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.\n\nBy removing the negative image associated with marijuana, people may become more inclined to use it responsibly, and its benefits can be harnessed for the greater good. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to marijuana's regulation could lead to a better understanding of its potential and its place in healthcare.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the modern era, and its strictness has decreased over time. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed that the atmosphere and dress code have become more casual. In my younger days, I would wear matching dresses and accessories, but now I see people attending in beachwear and casual clothing, even on Sundays. The church has introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, lasting only thirty minutes, and people generally dress down, especially during the summer months.\n\nAs I reflect on the church I know, I don't have insight into its internal politics, but I do think it has become more relaxed. However, I don't believe allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with these inclinations. While some people might try to suppress their desires, they often resurface. Therefore, I don't think the church's rules regarding marriage for priests would have made a difference.\n\nIt's essential to note that even married individuals with children can still develop pedophilic tendencies. Thus, I think it's more about the individual's inherent nature rather than their marital status. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different denomination that allows for this. The Catholic Church's stance on this matter might not be the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn my opinion, if the church was aware of and intentionally covered up these issues, that's a different story, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules could have prevented these incidents from occurring. If anything, I think it's essential to acknowledge that pedophilia is a complex issue linked to genetics and that marriage or the lack thereof is not a determining factor.",
            "I initially had reservations about the premise of the Iraq War, particularly because it came on the heels of the September 11th attacks. I believe the Bush administration used the war as a pretext, linking it to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that have since been proven false. This deception has been deeply disturbing to me, and the Iraq War continues to evoke strong emotions. \n\nThe Bush administration's transparent lies to the American people, as evidenced by Colin Powell's later admissions that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN, are a serious offense that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to erode it since 9/11 are equally concerning. It appears that the Bush administration had planned to go to war from the outset, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy supply.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, withdrawing now could lead to further chaos and bloodshed. The UN and the US are considering a coalition of regional nations to maintain order, but I'm skeptical about this plan, as it may ultimately undermine Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government is ineffective, with a dysfunctional Parliament and a lack of control from the Prime Minister. The presence of radical elements, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds significant power, is exacerbating the political instability.",
            "The speaker has mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They struggle to articulate their thoughts, initially stating that they feel it's pointless due to the fact that it was not officially declared as a war by Congress. They suggest that the US invaded Iraq as a form of retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, which they believe was a primary motivation for the conflict. The speaker is uncertain about the reasons for the US presence in Iraq, citing the possibility of trying to build democracy and gain access to oil resources as potential justifications. However, they argue that these reasons are not sufficient, as the war has led to widespread unrest and destruction in the region.\n\nThe speaker also expresses concerns about the long-term consequences of the war, including the potential for the US to try to impose its own system of government on Iraq, which could exacerbate the situation. They worry that the US presence will fuel the growth of anti-American sentiment, particularly among extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the speaker suggests that the war should continue, but not be referred to as a war, as it was not officially declared by Congress. They imply that the US is using military force to assert its power and dominance rather than to address a legitimate threat. However, this stance is later complicated by the speaker's empathy for families affected by the war, including those with loved ones serving in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the war in Iraq is a complex and multifaceted issue, with no clear solution in sight. They predict that the conflict will continue for years to come, with uncertain outcomes and unintended consequences.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for states to legalize or declare it as permissible. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, seems to suggest that this decision should be left to individual churches. The attempts to impose laws that restrict certain church activities appear to defy the principles established by the constitution.\n\nWhen considering those pushing for it to be made illegal, I believe it's essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. Many Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's role to dictate which activities are allowed or prohibited by the churches.\n\nThe principle of separation of church and state has been a core aspect of the US constitution, promoting religious tolerance. Proposing an amendment that restricts religious freedom, as I see it, contradicts the existing constitution. Moreover, such an amendment could be one of the few that restricts individual rights rather than limiting government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government and any government should not be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs, rather than a genuine need for a policy change. His actions suggest a preference for one religion over others, which I believe is unfair.\n\nThere's little justification for this amendment, aside from personal opinions. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, I think this decision should be left to individual churches, not the government.",
            "The Iraq war is a topic that raises many concerns about the honesty of the government towards the American people. Prior to the invasion, there are doubts that the government was transparent about the reasons for going to war. The link between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was overstated, and the government exploited the emotions of the American people to justify the invasion. This occurred in 2003, a time when the US was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs someone who generally opposes war, especially a preemptive strike, I believe that the Iraq war has many parallels with the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the consequences of removing a country's government and replacing it with a democratic one. The aftermath of the invasion was chaotic, and the US government was not adequately prepared to deal with the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe goal of installing a democratic government in Iraq was similar to the US's attempt to do the same in Vietnam, but it ultimately led to a protracted and difficult conflict. The US government underestimated the number of insurgents that would resist the occupation, and fighting a war against a nation's citizens is a far more challenging task than fighting a conventional army.\n\nIf the US government is to engage in a war, it must be better prepared for all possible outcomes. In the case of Iraq, the US government was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the country is still experiencing instability and violence. The training of Iraqi security forces and police has been a long and arduous process.\n\nFurthermore, the US government's portrayal of the war as a short and successful endeavor was misleading. Implementing a new form of government and establishing a stable democracy takes time, and the US should not have underestimated the complexity of the task. The US government's actions in Iraq have been criticized for being naive and based on a simplistic understanding of how to establish a democratic government.\n\nThe decision to go to war in Iraq was a difficult one, and it is hard to justify abandoning a country that the US had intervened in. However, the human cost of the war, including the number of American casualties, is a significant concern. The motivations behind the invasion, including the desire to control Iraq's oil resources, have also been questioned.\n\nThe fact that the US government has not taken similar action against other countries with similar issues, such as North Korea, which was known to possess weapons of mass destruction, has raised questions about the US government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the Iraq war has been a complex and multifaceted issue, and its legacy continues to be felt today.\n\nIn the end, the war in Iraq is a reminder of the importance of transparency and thoroughness in the decision-making process, and the need for the US government to be honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war. While it is hoped that the conflict will come to an end soon, the reality is that it may take much longer for the country to achieve stability and peace.",
            "I'd like to express my support for gay marriage. In my opinion, it's a personal preference and not a matter that should be influenced by societal or external factors. Research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological component, rather than being determined by upbringing or societal norms. I believe it's inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something they cannot control.\n\nI think the government and politics should not interfere with personal matters, including marriage. Marriage is a personal and private decision that should be made by individuals, not the government. In fact, I've seen many gay couples in my neighborhood who lead normal, functioning lives, just like any other family. It's absurd to allow politicians to impose their own interpretations of marriage on others.\n\nScientific studies have also shown that there may be a biological basis for homosexuality, rather than it being a result of environmental factors. For example, research has identified specific chemical differences in the brain that may influence an individual's sexual orientation.\n\nWhile there are some who may argue against gay marriage, I believe it's essential to recognize that it's a personal choice and not something that should be subject to public scrutiny. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married without informing anyone, they can do so without it being a major news event. However, when a same-sex couple tries to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. In my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public issue that's subject to federal or national attention.",

School officials have a responsibility to act on such information, even if it's difficult to determine what's serious and what's not.\n\nIn reality, the internet offers little to no privacy, so it's crucial to be mindful of what you share online. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control how others perceive you or what they take seriously. School officials should not friend students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines of their roles and create an invasion of students' privacy. However, if concerns are brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to act. It's a different matter if they're monitoring private communications, but if students share information publicly, it's a different story.\n\nFor example, as a Resident Advisor, I wouldn't create a social media account under a different name to friend students, as this would compromise their trust and make it difficult for me to maintain professional boundaries. Instead, I'd rather not have that connection and avoid being privy to sensitive information that might require my attention.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and its original purpose seems to have been lost in the process. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, which would be a valid reason to intervene, but it's questionable whether personal interests, such as resolving past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, played a role. \n\nIf the primary goal was to establish democracy, it would have been a justifiable reason, but it appears that the motives have shifted over time. The war's initial impact, which was evident in the first few months, was significant, as it made a bold statement. However, the prolonged duration of the war, spanning over a year or several years, has made it clear that the goal has been compromised.\n\nThe original intention of promoting democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant is a legitimate reason for going to war. Nevertheless, the war has lost its purpose and has become a self-sustaining entity. The desire to achieve a decisive victory or avoid defeat has led to further conflict. It's time for the country's government to take responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe war has been costly, with billions of dollars being spent, which could be better allocated to address domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, public education, and healthcare. It's illogical to prioritize funding a foreign war when these pressing issues demand attention. The money being spent could be more effectively used to improve the lives of citizens at home, rather than sacrificing lives in a foreign war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "To clarify, I'd like to ask if you're saying that a life was saved because someone discovered some information online that prevented a potentially threatening situation. I understand that when you share information on the internet, you're essentially making it available for anyone to see. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, you have to accept others as friends, which implies giving them permission to view your profile. \n\nThis raises questions about the balance between online safety and invasion of privacy. While it's impractical to have someone monitor all students' profiles, it's also problematic if schools are only focusing on certain individuals. However, if someone is actively searching for information, it's a different story. The concern then becomes whether they're genuinely looking for evidence of potential threats or just browsing randomly.\n\nPersonally, I'm uneasy about sharing personal details online, even though I have a Facebook account. I've seen examples of people exploiting social media for malicious purposes. For instance, someone might use a person's screen name and instant messaging to deceive them into meeting. This raises concerns about online safety and the potential for stalking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share on social media, but it's hard to strike a balance between being cautious and being able to connect with friends. It's difficult to know who can access your information, even if you only accept people you know.\n\nI recall hearing about a story where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts. It struck me as unusual, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what students could or couldn't have online. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure if it's a matter of privacy or something else entirely.",
            "There's a certain irony in discussing the Iraq War, given my own stance on the matter. I hesitate to join those who claim to have been against it from the beginning, as I was indeed opposed to it, but I don't think it's as significant now, considering the widespread consensus that the war was a bad idea, except within the administration. Looking at recent polls from the US, Iraq, and globally, it's clear that a significant majority of the world's population, around 75-80%, views the war as a mistake. Notably, 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops in the region believe that the war was a poor decision and that the US should withdraw within a year. \n\nThe situation in Iraq was already a disaster before the US involvement, and the situation has only worsened since. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries create significant barriers to understanding and resolving issues in the region. It's unrealistic to expect democracy to be easily imposed on a culture that might not naturally adopt it. Although Saddam was a bad leader, weighing the pros and cons of invading a country that would likely become a disaster was crucial. \n\nGiven the circumstances, it's challenging to see a compelling reason to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I struggle to see why we shouldn't leave now, especially considering that a significant number of Iraqis – including those we're trying to help – want us to leave within the year or immediately. If we ask them and they tell us to leave, it would be clearer that the responsibility for any negative outcome wouldn't lie with the US. \n\nIf we were to leave, we might at least be seen as trying to do the right thing, rather than perpetuating the current problematic situation. Although we'll never be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, it would be better than our current position.",
            "In the United States, it's clear that gender-based discrimination still persists in various aspects of society. While this issue affects both men and women, women often face significant challenges due to the 'glass ceiling' that hinders them from achieving equality. Women may have the qualifications and skills required for a particular position, but they may be overlooked for promotion simply because it's a historically male-dominated field, and society's biases are deeply ingrained. This is particularly evident in industries like business, where women are often expected to be subordinate to men.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations can also affect men who choose to stay at home and care for their children. Men who take on this role are often looked down upon and viewed as unconventional, as traditional societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for men who choose to defy these expectations.\n\nIn other industries, such as fashion, men who are interested in the field may face skepticism and prejudice due to societal stereotypes. For instance, men who work in fashion may be doubted and scrutinized simply because they are men, and people may question their understanding of the industry. However, this is beginning to change as people become more accepting and open-minded.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote awareness and understanding of the qualities and strengths of individuals who have traditionally been marginalized. Rather than forcing change, it's crucial to encourage a more nuanced and inclusive approach that celebrates diversity and challenges societal norms. By promoting acceptance and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nFurthermore, it's also essential to recognize that discrimination can occur within the same gender, depending on factors like education, background, or geographic location. For example, individuals from rural areas with limited access to education may face prejudice from those from more affluent areas who have had better opportunities. This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address inequality.",
            "My understanding is that by decriminalizing marijuana, it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where individuals are issued a citation rather than facing arrest and prosecution. This change can have significant long-term implications, such as affecting job prospects and other opportunities, which are often the most critical consequences of a drug charge. However, proponents of decriminalization argue that the cost of enforcing strict marijuana laws is substantial, including the expenses associated with arrest, booking, and court proceedings. This is particularly relevant for cash-strapped municipalities that may not have the financial resources to pursue such measures, even if it would ultimately save them money in the long run.\n\nIn places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization seems like a viable option. By decriminalizing marijuana, these cities can redirect the funds previously spent on enforcement towards more pressing issues, such as education, social programs, and assistance for the homeless. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use, including its impact on motor skills and overall lifestyle. While some argue that marijuana has a more significant influence on people's behavior, others claim that alcohol has a more detrimental effect on motor skills. Ultimately, individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of negative consequences.",
            "I would agree with this assessment.  The Catholic Church often adheres to traditional practices, which can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability.  However, it's equally crucial for the church to be open to change and adapt to the evolving needs of its members. \n\nSome people believe that the church's rigid adherence to its doctrine can lead to exclusivity and intolerance, particularly towards those who do not conform to Catholic teachings or belong to other faiths.  For instance, my family's experience showed that the church would not perform a marriage between two individuals from different denominations, despite the importance of love and acceptance.\n\nThis sense of hypocrisy can be disheartening, as the Catholic Church preaches love and compassion but fails to live up to these values in practice.  It's puzzling that the church clings to outdated practices, failing to recognize the need for reform.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it could be beneficial, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of child abuse.  Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be directly linked to marital status.  It's likely that individuals who engage in such behavior would continue to do so regardless of their marital status. \n\nIn conclusion, it's essential for the church to balance tradition and modernity, as well as to focus on creating a more inclusive environment that promotes love, acceptance, and compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue, and I don't have a strong opinion on whether one side is right or wrong. However, I believe that this topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between the separation of church and state, as well as defining what constitutes a marriage. It's difficult to approach this topic without offending someone or group.\n\nIn my opinion, all marriages should be viewed as civil unions, regardless of whether they are considered sacraments or not. This is because marriage is essentially a union between two individuals, and the government shouldn't intervene in matters that are typically considered personal and private. If two people decide to enter into a union, they should be treated equally under the law, without any additional scrutiny based on their religious affiliations.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, it's really just about two individuals forming a union, and they should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as anyone else in a civil union. I think it's unnecessary for states to come to a consensus on this issue and then push for federal legislation, as it's not a significant enough concern to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn fact, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it's a matter that affects a relatively small group of people. The constitution should not be changed to accommodate a minority view, especially when it doesn't align with the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our country is built upon.\n\nIn summary, the issue of gay marriage is not significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's best to view all marriages as civil unions, without any additional considerations based on religious beliefs or affiliations.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household had a complex impact on my views on homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I might not fully agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I believe the decision should be left to individual states rather than being imposed by the federal government. \n\nThis approach makes sense, considering the diverse views within different states, with many being democratic and others more conservative. In a democratic state, residents likely support gay marriage, and it's reasonable to accept their decision if they choose to legalize it. By living in a particular state, individuals implicitly agree to abide by its laws and policies.\n\nI believe individuals of all orientations should have equal opportunities, and it's only fair that each state has the autonomy to decide on the issue of gay marriage. It's not up to the federal government, such as a president, to dictate the laws of every state. A president, like Bush, should not have the authority to impose their views on the entire nation, especially if they don't live in every state and will eventually leave office.\n\nUltimately, I think certain decisions should be left to the discretion of individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices. This approach would prevent a constant back-and-forth on the issue, with decisions being reversed by subsequent administrations. By giving states the freedom to decide, we can respect their unique perspectives and allow them to create laws that work best for their residents.",
            "The speaker begins by acknowledging that social media platforms like Myspace are public spaces where users post content for others to see. They argue that if a student posts something on Myspace, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, even if it's not under the school's official name, because they could still access it from home. The speaker believes that school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, which includes monitoring potential threats, such as student behavior that could lead to a school shooting.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that monitoring students' online activities can be an invasion of privacy. They draw a distinction between monitoring student behavior that's intended to catch students doing something wrong and monitoring that's aimed at preventing harm or making the school a safer place. The speaker suggests that the latter is acceptable, even if it means school officials are accessing private online content.\n\nThe speaker compares this to a lockdown drill, which is a measure implemented to ensure student safety, particularly in the wake of a terrorist attack. They see school officials' actions in this case as a similar attempt to prevent harm and make the school a safer place. The speaker concludes that, in their opinion, it's reasonable for school officials to monitor student online activities if it's done to prevent harm and maintain a safe environment.\n\nThe speaker also notes that once content is posted online, it's difficult to control who sees it, and it can come back to haunt the poster in the future. They suggest that students should be cautious when posting online, anticipating that their content may be discovered and used against them.\n\nOverall, the speaker's opinion is that school officials' actions were justified in this case, as they were aimed at preventing harm and maintaining a safe environment for students.",
            "Initially, I had strong support for going to war after 9/11, as it was a personal and emotional issue for me. However, I soon realized that we were not adequately prepared and lacked a clear plan for the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that our decision to invade was driven more by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a well-thought-out strategy. As a result, our involvement in the war ultimately backfired, and we failed to achieve our goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in that region are so consumed by internal conflicts that they cannot possibly focus on fighting against us. It's almost as if they're fighting a war within themselves, and it's pointless for us to try to impose our will on them. I've come to a point where I've lost interest in the situation, and I don't think it's our place to try to change them.\n\nOne of the main problems with our approach was that we didn't fully understand the culture and mindset of the people we were fighting against. War is a vastly different concept for them than it is for us, and it's often driven by tribal and primal instincts rather than a desire to build a better country.\n\nI think we were initially driven by a desire for revenge and a sense of moral duty, rather than a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I can understand his motivations, I think we could have handled the situation differently. We could have taken a more measured approach, with a clear plan and a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, our lack of unity and planning led to a series of costly mistakes. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and our actions only created more chaos and divisions. I believe that we're not equipped to change the people in that region, and they will likely always be driven by their own internal conflicts.\n\nI think it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the war and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the costs and sacrifices we're making. In the end, I believe that our continued presence will only lead to further instability, and it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties handle their own affairs."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on several issues in order to prevent a decline in its following. One possible reason for this decline is the church's rigidity on certain topics, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated by some. By adapting to a more modern perspective, the church may be able to retain its followers who feel alienated by its conservative views. \n\nMany people are beginning to question the Catholic Church's stance on these issues and may choose not to follow the church if they disagree with its teachings. For instance, individuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable belonging to a community that views these practices as morally wrong. Similarly, people who value personal freedom and autonomy may be put off by the church's strict views on these matters.\n\nThe Catholic Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is another area where some may see the institution as out of touch. It's hard to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have prevented past scandals, but it's clear that these issues are not necessarily linked. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to question why the church bars priests from marrying and having a family life, especially when many other professionals are able to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nThe church's argument that priests are married to God and devoted to their spiritual calling doesn't necessarily justify its stance on marriage and family life. In reality, most people have multiple commitments and responsibilities, and it's not unreasonable to expect priests to have a similar balance in their lives.",
            "Personally, I don't object to same-sex marriage. It's my opinion that people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, so it's unfair to hold them accountable for it. Therefore, I believe it's wrong to deny marriage rights to couples of the same sex while allowing heterosexual couples to marry. I haven't given much thought to the issue, but I firmly believe that this discrimination is unjust.\n\nIt seems that sexual orientation isn't a matter of personal choice, as people are born with their natural inclinations. I was born straight, and others are born gay – it's just a natural aspect of who they are. I don't think they should be blamed or held accountable for their orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's a personal matter that doesn't concern the government. I don't think it's right for them to intervene in people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal relationships and identities.\n\nUltimately, people should be free to be who they are without fear of persecution or judgment. The government's involvement in this issue seems out of place and unnecessary. Gay people are not responsible for their orientation, and they shouldn't be punished for it. They should be treated with respect and equality, just like anyone else.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people think that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but they are simply two different sides of the same coin, with their own unique characteristics. The notion that gay couples are a threat is unfounded and lacks evidence. \n\nResearch has shown that gay couples fare similarly to straight couples in terms of relationship satisfaction, and they have the same fundamental needs and desires. They're not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather for a legal document that acknowledges their union, which is a civil matter, not a religious one. \n\nThe argument that allowing gay marriage would lead to the erosion of traditional values is a weak one. It's similar to saying that civil rights for African Americans or women would lead to the downfall of society. The idea that gay people are morally flawed or that their sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception that has been disproven by scientific studies. \n\nThe opposition to gay marriage is often rooted in ignorance and a lack of understanding. People's moral compasses may vary, but it's unfair to impose one group's morality on the entire country. Moreover, it's hypocritical for politicians to push for laws that enforce their own moral standards without considering the perspectives of others.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a choice. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. It's essential to rely on research and evidence rather than anecdotal opinions or popular culture.\n\nUltimately, I think the federal government should take a more progressive stance on this issue and legalize gay marriage across the country. The idea that the government should intervene in personal relationships and dictate who can or cannot get married is a flawed one. It's time for us to move forward and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "To clarify my stance on the availability of certain substances, I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand the benefits of using controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, which are often misunderstood due to their legal status. Conversely, I believe that just because marijuana is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it lacks beneficial properties. In fact, if its medicinal uses are acknowledged, it could be a valuable treatment option for patients.\n\nWhile it's true that abusing any substance can lead to negative consequences, the comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely accurate. However, a more gradual introduction of marijuana into the legal system might mitigate potential abuse. The primary issue lies in the stigma surrounding marijuana, which is often fueled by its illegality. By reevaluating this stigma and understanding that marijuana is not as detrimental as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine, we may be able to encourage responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.\n\nBy removing the negative image associated with marijuana, people may become more inclined to use it responsibly, and its benefits can be harnessed for the greater good. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to marijuana's regulation could lead to a better understanding of its potential and its place in healthcare.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the modern era, and its strictness has decreased over time. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed that the atmosphere and dress code have become more casual. In my younger days, I would wear matching dresses and accessories, but now I see people attending in beachwear and casual clothing, even on Sundays. The church has introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, lasting only thirty minutes, and people generally dress down, especially during the summer months.\n\nAs I reflect on the church I know, I don't have insight into its internal politics, but I do think it has become more relaxed. However, I don't believe allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with these inclinations. While some people might try to suppress their desires, they often resurface. Therefore, I don't think the church's rules regarding marriage for priests would have made a difference.\n\nIt's essential to note that even married individuals with children can still develop pedophilic tendencies. Thus, I think it's more about the individual's inherent nature rather than their marital status. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different denomination that allows for this. The Catholic Church's stance on this matter might not be the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn my opinion, if the church was aware of and intentionally covered up these issues, that's a different story, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules could have prevented these incidents from occurring. If anything, I think it's essential to acknowledge that pedophilia is a complex issue linked to genetics and that marriage or the lack thereof is not a determining factor.",
            "I initially had reservations about the premise of the Iraq War, particularly because it came on the heels of the September 11th attacks. I believe the Bush administration used the war as a pretext, linking it to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that have since been proven false. This deception has been deeply disturbing to me, and the Iraq War continues to evoke strong emotions. \n\nThe Bush administration's transparent lies to the American people, as evidenced by Colin Powell's later admissions that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN, are a serious offense that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to erode it since 9/11 are equally concerning. It appears that the Bush administration had planned to go to war from the outset, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy supply.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, withdrawing now could lead to further chaos and bloodshed. The UN and the US are considering a coalition of regional nations to maintain order, but I'm skeptical about this plan, as it may ultimately undermine Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government is ineffective, with a dysfunctional Parliament and a lack of control from the Prime Minister. The presence of radical elements, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds significant power, is exacerbating the political instability.",
            "The speaker has mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They struggle to articulate their thoughts, initially stating that they feel it's pointless due to the fact that it was not officially declared as a war by Congress. They suggest that the US invaded Iraq as a form of retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, which they believe was a primary motivation for the conflict. The speaker is uncertain about the reasons for the US presence in Iraq, citing the possibility of trying to build democracy and gain access to oil resources as potential justifications. However, they argue that these reasons are not sufficient, as the war has led to widespread unrest and destruction in the region.\n\nThe speaker also expresses concerns about the long-term consequences of the war, including the potential for the US to try to impose its own system of government on Iraq, which could exacerbate the situation. They worry that the US presence will fuel the growth of anti-American sentiment, particularly among extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the speaker suggests that the war should continue, but not be referred to as a war, as it was not officially declared by Congress. They imply that the US is using military force to assert its power and dominance rather than to address a legitimate threat. However, this stance is later complicated by the speaker's empathy for families affected by the war, including those with loved ones serving in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the war in Iraq is a complex and multifaceted issue, with no clear solution in sight. They predict that the conflict will continue for years to come, with uncertain outcomes and unintended consequences.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for states to legalize or declare it as permissible. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, seems to suggest that this decision should be left to individual churches. The attempts to impose laws that restrict certain church activities appear to defy the principles established by the constitution.\n\nWhen considering those pushing for it to be made illegal, I believe it's essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. Many Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's role to dictate which activities are allowed or prohibited by the churches.\n\nThe principle of separation of church and state has been a core aspect of the US constitution, promoting religious tolerance. Proposing an amendment that restricts religious freedom, as I see it, contradicts the existing constitution. Moreover, such an amendment could be one of the few that restricts individual rights rather than limiting government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government and any government should not be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs, rather than a genuine need for a policy change. His actions suggest a preference for one religion over others, which I believe is unfair.\n\nThere's little justification for this amendment, aside from personal opinions. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, I think this decision should be left to individual churches, not the government.",
            "The Iraq war is a topic that raises many concerns about the honesty of the government towards the American people. Prior to the invasion, there are doubts that the government was transparent about the reasons for going to war. The link between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was overstated, and the government exploited the emotions of the American people to justify the invasion. This occurred in 2003, a time when the US was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs someone who generally opposes war, especially a preemptive strike, I believe that the Iraq war has many parallels with the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the consequences of removing a country's government and replacing it with a democratic one. The aftermath of the invasion was chaotic, and the US government was not adequately prepared to deal with the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe goal of installing a democratic government in Iraq was similar to the US's attempt to do the same in Vietnam, but it ultimately led to a protracted and difficult conflict. The US government underestimated the number of insurgents that would resist the occupation, and fighting a war against a nation's citizens is a far more challenging task than fighting a conventional army.\n\nIf the US government is to engage in a war, it must be better prepared for all possible outcomes. In the case of Iraq, the US government was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the country is still experiencing instability and violence. The training of Iraqi security forces and police has been a long and arduous process.\n\nFurthermore, the US government's portrayal of the war as a short and successful endeavor was misleading. Implementing a new form of government and establishing a stable democracy takes time, and the US should not have underestimated the complexity of the task. The US government's actions in Iraq have been criticized for being naive and based on a simplistic understanding of how to establish a democratic government.\n\nThe decision to go to war in Iraq was a difficult one, and it is hard to justify abandoning a country that the US had intervened in. However, the human cost of the war, including the number of American casualties, is a significant concern. The motivations behind the invasion, including the desire to control Iraq's oil resources, have also been questioned.\n\nThe fact that the US government has not taken similar action against other countries with similar issues, such as North Korea, which was known to possess weapons of mass destruction, has raised questions about the US government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the Iraq war has been a complex and multifaceted issue, and its legacy continues to be felt today.\n\nIn the end, the war in Iraq is a reminder of the importance of transparency and thoroughness in the decision-making process, and the need for the US government to be honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war. While it is hoped that the conflict will come to an end soon, the reality is that it may take much longer for the country to achieve stability and peace.",
            "I'd like to express my support for gay marriage. In my opinion, it's a personal preference and not a matter that should be influenced by societal or external factors. Research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological component, rather than being determined by upbringing or societal norms. I believe it's inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something they cannot control.\n\nI think the government and politics should not interfere with personal matters, including marriage. Marriage is a personal and private decision that should be made by individuals, not the government. In fact, I've seen many gay couples in my neighborhood who lead normal, functioning lives, just like any other family. It's absurd to allow politicians to impose their own interpretations of marriage on others.\n\nScientific studies have also shown that there may be a biological basis for homosexuality, rather than it being a result of environmental factors. For example, research has identified specific chemical differences in the brain that may influence an individual's sexual orientation.\n\nWhile there are some who may argue against gay marriage, I believe it's essential to recognize that it's a personal choice and not something that should be subject to public scrutiny. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married without informing anyone, they can do so without it being a major news event. However, when a same-sex couple tries to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. In my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public issue that's subject to federal or national attention.",

School officials have a responsibility to act on such information, even if it's difficult to determine what's serious and what's not.\n\nIn reality, the internet offers little to no privacy, so it's crucial to be mindful of what you share online. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control how others perceive you or what they take seriously. School officials should not friend students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines of their roles and create an invasion of students' privacy. However, if concerns are brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to act. It's a different matter if they're monitoring private communications, but if students share information publicly, it's a different story.\n\nFor example, as a Resident Advisor, I wouldn't create a social media account under a different name to friend students, as this would compromise their trust and make it difficult for me to maintain professional boundaries. Instead, I'd rather not have that connection and avoid being privy to sensitive information that might require my attention.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and its original purpose seems to have been lost in the process. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, which would be a valid reason to intervene, but it's questionable whether personal interests, such as resolving past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, played a role. \n\nIf the primary goal was to establish democracy, it would have been a justifiable reason, but it appears that the motives have shifted over time. The war's initial impact, which was evident in the first few months, was significant, as it made a bold statement. However, the prolonged duration of the war, spanning over a year or several years, has made it clear that the goal has been compromised.\n\nThe original intention of promoting democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant is a legitimate reason for going to war. Nevertheless, the war has lost its purpose and has become a self-sustaining entity. The desire to achieve a decisive victory or avoid defeat has led to further conflict. It's time for the country's government to take responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe war has been costly, with billions of dollars being spent, which could be better allocated to address domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, public education, and healthcare. It's illogical to prioritize funding a foreign war when these pressing issues demand attention. The money being spent could be more effectively used to improve the lives of citizens at home, rather than sacrificing lives in a foreign war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "To clarify, I'd like to ask if you're saying that a life was saved because someone discovered some information online that prevented a potentially threatening situation. I understand that when you share information on the internet, you're essentially making it available for anyone to see. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, you have to accept others as friends, which implies giving them permission to view your profile. \n\nThis raises questions about the balance between online safety and invasion of privacy. While it's impractical to have someone monitor all students' profiles, it's also problematic if schools are only focusing on certain individuals. However, if someone is actively searching for information, it's a different story. The concern then becomes whether they're genuinely looking for evidence of potential threats or just browsing randomly.\n\nPersonally, I'm uneasy about sharing personal details online, even though I have a Facebook account. I've seen examples of people exploiting social media for malicious purposes. For instance, someone might use a person's screen name and instant messaging to deceive them into meeting. This raises concerns about online safety and the potential for stalking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share on social media, but it's hard to strike a balance between being cautious and being able to connect with friends. It's difficult to know who can access your information, even if you only accept people you know.\n\nI recall hearing about a story where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts. It struck me as unusual, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what students could or couldn't have online. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure if it's a matter of privacy or something else entirely.",
            "There's a certain irony in discussing the Iraq War, given my own stance on the matter. I hesitate to join those who claim to have been against it from the beginning, as I was indeed opposed to it, but I don't think it's as significant now, considering the widespread consensus that the war was a bad idea, except within the administration. Looking at recent polls from the US, Iraq, and globally, it's clear that a significant majority of the world's population, around 75-80%, views the war as a mistake. Notably, 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops in the region believe that the war was a poor decision and that the US should withdraw within a year. \n\nThe situation in Iraq was already a disaster before the US involvement, and the situation has only worsened since. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries create significant barriers to understanding and resolving issues in the region. It's unrealistic to expect democracy to be easily imposed on a culture that might not naturally adopt it. Although Saddam was a bad leader, weighing the pros and cons of invading a country that would likely become a disaster was crucial. \n\nGiven the circumstances, it's challenging to see a compelling reason to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I struggle to see why we shouldn't leave now, especially considering that a significant number of Iraqis – including those we're trying to help – want us to leave within the year or immediately. If we ask them and they tell us to leave, it would be clearer that the responsibility for any negative outcome wouldn't lie with the US. \n\nIf we were to leave, we might at least be seen as trying to do the right thing, rather than perpetuating the current problematic situation. Although we'll never be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, it would be better than our current position.",
            "In the United States, it's clear that gender-based discrimination still persists in various aspects of society. While this issue affects both men and women, women often face significant challenges due to the 'glass ceiling' that hinders them from achieving equality. Women may have the qualifications and skills required for a particular position, but they may be overlooked for promotion simply because it's a historically male-dominated field, and society's biases are deeply ingrained. This is particularly evident in industries like business, where women are often expected to be subordinate to men.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations can also affect men who choose to stay at home and care for their children. Men who take on this role are often looked down upon and viewed as unconventional, as traditional societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for men who choose to defy these expectations.\n\nIn other industries, such as fashion, men who are interested in the field may face skepticism and prejudice due to societal stereotypes. For instance, men who work in fashion may be doubted and scrutinized simply because they are men, and people may question their understanding of the industry. However, this is beginning to change as people become more accepting and open-minded.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote awareness and understanding of the qualities and strengths of individuals who have traditionally been marginalized. Rather than forcing change, it's crucial to encourage a more nuanced and inclusive approach that celebrates diversity and challenges societal norms. By promoting acceptance and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nFurthermore, it's also essential to recognize that discrimination can occur within the same gender, depending on factors like education, background, or geographic location. For example, individuals from rural areas with limited access to education may face prejudice from those from more affluent areas who have had better opportunities. This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address inequality.",
            "My understanding is that by decriminalizing marijuana, it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where individuals are issued a citation rather than facing arrest and prosecution. This change can have significant long-term implications, such as affecting job prospects and other opportunities, which are often the most critical consequences of a drug charge. However, proponents of decriminalization argue that the cost of enforcing strict marijuana laws is substantial, including the expenses associated with arrest, booking, and court proceedings. This is particularly relevant for cash-strapped municipalities that may not have the financial resources to pursue such measures, even if it would ultimately save them money in the long run.\n\nIn places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization seems like a viable option. By decriminalizing marijuana, these cities can redirect the funds previously spent on enforcement towards more pressing issues, such as education, social programs, and assistance for the homeless. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use, including its impact on motor skills and overall lifestyle. While some argue that marijuana has a more significant influence on people's behavior, others claim that alcohol has a more detrimental effect on motor skills. Ultimately, individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of negative consequences.",
            "I would agree with this assessment.  The Catholic Church often adheres to traditional practices, which can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability.  However, it's equally crucial for the church to be open to change and adapt to the evolving needs of its members. \n\nSome people believe that the church's rigid adherence to its doctrine can lead to exclusivity and intolerance, particularly towards those who do not conform to Catholic teachings or belong to other faiths.  For instance, my family's experience showed that the church would not perform a marriage between two individuals from different denominations, despite the importance of love and acceptance.\n\nThis sense of hypocrisy can be disheartening, as the Catholic Church preaches love and compassion but fails to live up to these values in practice.  It's puzzling that the church clings to outdated practices, failing to recognize the need for reform.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it could be beneficial, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of child abuse.  Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be directly linked to marital status.  It's likely that individuals who engage in such behavior would continue to do so regardless of their marital status. \n\nIn conclusion, it's essential for the church to balance tradition and modernity, as well as to focus on creating a more inclusive environment that promotes love, acceptance, and compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue, and I don't have a strong opinion on whether one side is right or wrong. However, I believe that this topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between the separation of church and state, as well as defining what constitutes a marriage. It's difficult to approach this topic without offending someone or group.\n\nIn my opinion, all marriages should be viewed as civil unions, regardless of whether they are considered sacraments or not. This is because marriage is essentially a union between two individuals, and the government shouldn't intervene in matters that are typically considered personal and private. If two people decide to enter into a union, they should be treated equally under the law, without any additional scrutiny based on their religious affiliations.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, it's really just about two individuals forming a union, and they should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as anyone else in a civil union. I think it's unnecessary for states to come to a consensus on this issue and then push for federal legislation, as it's not a significant enough concern to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn fact, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it's a matter that affects a relatively small group of people. The constitution should not be changed to accommodate a minority view, especially when it doesn't align with the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our country is built upon.\n\nIn summary, the issue of gay marriage is not significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's best to view all marriages as civil unions, without any additional considerations based on religious beliefs or affiliations.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household had a complex impact on my views on homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I might not fully agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I believe the decision should be left to individual states rather than being imposed by the federal government. \n\nThis approach makes sense, considering the diverse views within different states, with many being democratic and others more conservative. In a democratic state, residents likely support gay marriage, and it's reasonable to accept their decision if they choose to legalize it. By living in a particular state, individuals implicitly agree to abide by its laws and policies.\n\nI believe individuals of all orientations should have equal opportunities, and it's only fair that each state has the autonomy to decide on the issue of gay marriage. It's not up to the federal government, such as a president, to dictate the laws of every state. A president, like Bush, should not have the authority to impose their views on the entire nation, especially if they don't live in every state and will eventually leave office.\n\nUltimately, I think certain decisions should be left to the discretion of individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices. This approach would prevent a constant back-and-forth on the issue, with decisions being reversed by subsequent administrations. By giving states the freedom to decide, we can respect their unique perspectives and allow them to create laws that work best for their residents.",
            "The speaker begins by acknowledging that social media platforms like Myspace are public spaces where users post content for others to see. They argue that if a student posts something on Myspace, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, even if it's not under the school's official name, because they could still access it from home. The speaker believes that school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, which includes monitoring potential threats, such as student behavior that could lead to a school shooting.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that monitoring students' online activities can be an invasion of privacy. They draw a distinction between monitoring student behavior that's intended to catch students doing something wrong and monitoring that's aimed at preventing harm or making the school a safer place. The speaker suggests that the latter is acceptable, even if it means school officials are accessing private online content.\n\nThe speaker compares this to a lockdown drill, which is a measure implemented to ensure student safety, particularly in the wake of a terrorist attack. They see school officials' actions in this case as a similar attempt to prevent harm and make the school a safer place. The speaker concludes that, in their opinion, it's reasonable for school officials to monitor student online activities if it's done to prevent harm and maintain a safe environment.\n\nThe speaker also notes that once content is posted online, it's difficult to control who sees it, and it can come back to haunt the poster in the future. They suggest that students should be cautious when posting online, anticipating that their content may be discovered and used against them.\n\nOverall, the speaker's opinion is that school officials' actions were justified in this case, as they were aimed at preventing harm and maintaining a safe environment for students.",
            "Initially, I had strong support for going to war after 9/11, as it was a personal and emotional issue for me. However, I soon realized that we were not adequately prepared and lacked a clear plan for the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that our decision to invade was driven more by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a well-thought-out strategy. As a result, our involvement in the war ultimately backfired, and we failed to achieve our goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in that region are so consumed by internal conflicts that they cannot possibly focus on fighting against us. It's almost as if they're fighting a war within themselves, and it's pointless for us to try to impose our will on them. I've come to a point where I've lost interest in the situation, and I don't think it's our place to try to change them.\n\nOne of the main problems with our approach was that we didn't fully understand the culture and mindset of the people we were fighting against. War is a vastly different concept for them than it is for us, and it's often driven by tribal and primal instincts rather than a desire to build a better country.\n\nI think we were initially driven by a desire for revenge and a sense of moral duty, rather than a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I can understand his motivations, I think we could have handled the situation differently. We could have taken a more measured approach, with a clear plan and a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, our lack of unity and planning led to a series of costly mistakes. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and our actions only created more chaos and divisions. I believe that we're not equipped to change the people in that region, and they will likely always be driven by their own internal conflicts.\n\nI think it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the war and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the costs and sacrifices we're making. In the end, I believe that our continued presence will only lead to further instability, and it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties handle their own affairs."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on several issues in order to prevent a decline in its following. One possible reason for this decline is the church's rigidity on certain topics, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated by some. By adapting to a more modern perspective, the church may be able to retain its followers who feel alienated by its conservative views. \n\nMany people are beginning to question the Catholic Church's stance on these issues and may choose not to follow the church if they disagree with its teachings. For instance, individuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable belonging to a community that views these practices as morally wrong. Similarly, people who value personal freedom and autonomy may be put off by the church's strict views on these matters.\n\nThe Catholic Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is another area where some may see the institution as out of touch. It's hard to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have prevented past scandals, but it's clear that these issues are not necessarily linked. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to question why the church bars priests from marrying and having a family life, especially when many other professionals are able to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nThe church's argument that priests are married to God and devoted to their spiritual calling doesn't necessarily justify its stance on marriage and family life. In reality, most people have multiple commitments and responsibilities, and it's not unreasonable to expect priests to have a similar balance in their lives.",
            "Personally, I don't object to same-sex marriage. It's my opinion that people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, so it's unfair to hold them accountable for it. Therefore, I believe it's wrong to deny marriage rights to couples of the same sex while allowing heterosexual couples to marry. I haven't given much thought to the issue, but I firmly believe that this discrimination is unjust.\n\nIt seems that sexual orientation isn't a matter of personal choice, as people are born with their natural inclinations. I was born straight, and others are born gay – it's just a natural aspect of who they are. I don't think they should be blamed or held accountable for their orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's a personal matter that doesn't concern the government. I don't think it's right for them to intervene in people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal relationships and identities.\n\nUltimately, people should be free to be who they are without fear of persecution or judgment. The government's involvement in this issue seems out of place and unnecessary. Gay people are not responsible for their orientation, and they shouldn't be punished for it. They should be treated with respect and equality, just like anyone else.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people think that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but they are simply two different sides of the same coin, with their own unique characteristics. The notion that gay couples are a threat is unfounded and lacks evidence. \n\nResearch has shown that gay couples fare similarly to straight couples in terms of relationship satisfaction, and they have the same fundamental needs and desires. They're not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather for a legal document that acknowledges their union, which is a civil matter, not a religious one. \n\nThe argument that allowing gay marriage would lead to the erosion of traditional values is a weak one. It's similar to saying that civil rights for African Americans or women would lead to the downfall of society. The idea that gay people are morally flawed or that their sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception that has been disproven by scientific studies. \n\nThe opposition to gay marriage is often rooted in ignorance and a lack of understanding. People's moral compasses may vary, but it's unfair to impose one group's morality on the entire country. Moreover, it's hypocritical for politicians to push for laws that enforce their own moral standards without considering the perspectives of others.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a choice. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. It's essential to rely on research and evidence rather than anecdotal opinions or popular culture.\n\nUltimately, I think the federal government should take a more progressive stance on this issue and legalize gay marriage across the country. The idea that the government should intervene in personal relationships and dictate who can or cannot get married is a flawed one. It's time for us to move forward and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "To clarify my stance on the availability of certain substances, I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand the benefits of using controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, which are often misunderstood due to their legal status. Conversely, I believe that just because marijuana is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it lacks beneficial properties. In fact, if its medicinal uses are acknowledged, it could be a valuable treatment option for patients.\n\nWhile it's true that abusing any substance can lead to negative consequences, the comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely accurate. However, a more gradual introduction of marijuana into the legal system might mitigate potential abuse. The primary issue lies in the stigma surrounding marijuana, which is often fueled by its illegality. By reevaluating this stigma and understanding that marijuana is not as detrimental as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine, we may be able to encourage responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.\n\nBy removing the negative image associated with marijuana, people may become more inclined to use it responsibly, and its benefits can be harnessed for the greater good. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to marijuana's regulation could lead to a better understanding of its potential and its place in healthcare.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the modern era, and its strictness has decreased over time. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed that the atmosphere and dress code have become more casual. In my younger days, I would wear matching dresses and accessories, but now I see people attending in beachwear and casual clothing, even on Sundays. The church has introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, lasting only thirty minutes, and people generally dress down, especially during the summer months.\n\nAs I reflect on the church I know, I don't have insight into its internal politics, but I do think it has become more relaxed. However, I don't believe allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with these inclinations. While some people might try to suppress their desires, they often resurface. Therefore, I don't think the church's rules regarding marriage for priests would have made a difference.\n\nIt's essential to note that even married individuals with children can still develop pedophilic tendencies. Thus, I think it's more about the individual's inherent nature rather than their marital status. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different denomination that allows for this. The Catholic Church's stance on this matter might not be the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn my opinion, if the church was aware of and intentionally covered up these issues, that's a different story, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules could have prevented these incidents from occurring. If anything, I think it's essential to acknowledge that pedophilia is a complex issue linked to genetics and that marriage or the lack thereof is not a determining factor.",
            "I initially had reservations about the premise of the Iraq War, particularly because it came on the heels of the September 11th attacks. I believe the Bush administration used the war as a pretext, linking it to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that have since been proven false. This deception has been deeply disturbing to me, and the Iraq War continues to evoke strong emotions. \n\nThe Bush administration's transparent lies to the American people, as evidenced by Colin Powell's later admissions that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN, are a serious offense that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to erode it since 9/11 are equally concerning. It appears that the Bush administration had planned to go to war from the outset, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy supply.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, withdrawing now could lead to further chaos and bloodshed. The UN and the US are considering a coalition of regional nations to maintain order, but I'm skeptical about this plan, as it may ultimately undermine Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government is ineffective, with a dysfunctional Parliament and a lack of control from the Prime Minister. The presence of radical elements, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds significant power, is exacerbating the political instability.",
            "The speaker has mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They struggle to articulate their thoughts, initially stating that they feel it's pointless due to the fact that it was not officially declared as a war by Congress. They suggest that the US invaded Iraq as a form of retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, which they believe was a primary motivation for the conflict. The speaker is uncertain about the reasons for the US presence in Iraq, citing the possibility of trying to build democracy and gain access to oil resources as potential justifications. However, they argue that these reasons are not sufficient, as the war has led to widespread unrest and destruction in the region.\n\nThe speaker also expresses concerns about the long-term consequences of the war, including the potential for the US to try to impose its own system of government on Iraq, which could exacerbate the situation. They worry that the US presence will fuel the growth of anti-American sentiment, particularly among extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the speaker suggests that the war should continue, but not be referred to as a war, as it was not officially declared by Congress. They imply that the US is using military force to assert its power and dominance rather than to address a legitimate threat. However, this stance is later complicated by the speaker's empathy for families affected by the war, including those with loved ones serving in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the war in Iraq is a complex and multifaceted issue, with no clear solution in sight. They predict that the conflict will continue for years to come, with uncertain outcomes and unintended consequences.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for states to legalize or declare it as permissible. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, seems to suggest that this decision should be left to individual churches. The attempts to impose laws that restrict certain church activities appear to defy the principles established by the constitution.\n\nWhen considering those pushing for it to be made illegal, I believe it's essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. Many Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's role to dictate which activities are allowed or prohibited by the churches.\n\nThe principle of separation of church and state has been a core aspect of the US constitution, promoting religious tolerance. Proposing an amendment that restricts religious freedom, as I see it, contradicts the existing constitution. Moreover, such an amendment could be one of the few that restricts individual rights rather than limiting government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government and any government should not be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs, rather than a genuine need for a policy change. His actions suggest a preference for one religion over others, which I believe is unfair.\n\nThere's little justification for this amendment, aside from personal opinions. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, I think this decision should be left to individual churches, not the government.",
            "The Iraq war is a topic that raises many concerns about the honesty of the government towards the American people. Prior to the invasion, there are doubts that the government was transparent about the reasons for going to war. The link between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was overstated, and the government exploited the emotions of the American people to justify the invasion. This occurred in 2003, a time when the US was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs someone who generally opposes war, especially a preemptive strike, I believe that the Iraq war has many parallels with the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the consequences of removing a country's government and replacing it with a democratic one. The aftermath of the invasion was chaotic, and the US government was not adequately prepared to deal with the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe goal of installing a democratic government in Iraq was similar to the US's attempt to do the same in Vietnam, but it ultimately led to a protracted and difficult conflict. The US government underestimated the number of insurgents that would resist the occupation, and fighting a war against a nation's citizens is a far more challenging task than fighting a conventional army.\n\nIf the US government is to engage in a war, it must be better prepared for all possible outcomes. In the case of Iraq, the US government was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the country is still experiencing instability and violence. The training of Iraqi security forces and police has been a long and arduous process.\n\nFurthermore, the US government's portrayal of the war as a short and successful endeavor was misleading. Implementing a new form of government and establishing a stable democracy takes time, and the US should not have underestimated the complexity of the task. The US government's actions in Iraq have been criticized for being naive and based on a simplistic understanding of how to establish a democratic government.\n\nThe decision to go to war in Iraq was a difficult one, and it is hard to justify abandoning a country that the US had intervened in. However, the human cost of the war, including the number of American casualties, is a significant concern. The motivations behind the invasion, including the desire to control Iraq's oil resources, have also been questioned.\n\nThe fact that the US government has not taken similar action against other countries with similar issues, such as North Korea, which was known to possess weapons of mass destruction, has raised questions about the US government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the Iraq war has been a complex and multifaceted issue, and its legacy continues to be felt today.\n\nIn the end, the war in Iraq is a reminder of the importance of transparency and thoroughness in the decision-making process, and the need for the US government to be honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war. While it is hoped that the conflict will come to an end soon, the reality is that it may take much longer for the country to achieve stability and peace.",
            "I'd like to express my support for gay marriage. In my opinion, it's a personal preference and not a matter that should be influenced by societal or external factors. Research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological component, rather than being determined by upbringing or societal norms. I believe it's inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something they cannot control.\n\nI think the government and politics should not interfere with personal matters, including marriage. Marriage is a personal and private decision that should be made by individuals, not the government. In fact, I've seen many gay couples in my neighborhood who lead normal, functioning lives, just like any other family. It's absurd to allow politicians to impose their own interpretations of marriage on others.\n\nScientific studies have also shown that there may be a biological basis for homosexuality, rather than it being a result of environmental factors. For example, research has identified specific chemical differences in the brain that may influence an individual's sexual orientation.\n\nWhile there are some who may argue against gay marriage, I believe it's essential to recognize that it's a personal choice and not something that should be subject to public scrutiny. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married without informing anyone, they can do so without it being a major news event. However, when a same-sex couple tries to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. In my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public issue that's subject to federal or national attention.",

School officials have a responsibility to act on such information, even if it's difficult to determine what's serious and what's not.\n\nIn reality, the internet offers little to no privacy, so it's crucial to be mindful of what you share online. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control how others perceive you or what they take seriously. School officials should not friend students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines of their roles and create an invasion of students' privacy. However, if concerns are brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to act. It's a different matter if they're monitoring private communications, but if students share information publicly, it's a different story.\n\nFor example, as a Resident Advisor, I wouldn't create a social media account under a different name to friend students, as this would compromise their trust and make it difficult for me to maintain professional boundaries. Instead, I'd rather not have that connection and avoid being privy to sensitive information that might require my attention.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and its original purpose seems to have been lost in the process. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, which would be a valid reason to intervene, but it's questionable whether personal interests, such as resolving past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, played a role. \n\nIf the primary goal was to establish democracy, it would have been a justifiable reason, but it appears that the motives have shifted over time. The war's initial impact, which was evident in the first few months, was significant, as it made a bold statement. However, the prolonged duration of the war, spanning over a year or several years, has made it clear that the goal has been compromised.\n\nThe original intention of promoting democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant is a legitimate reason for going to war. Nevertheless, the war has lost its purpose and has become a self-sustaining entity. The desire to achieve a decisive victory or avoid defeat has led to further conflict. It's time for the country's government to take responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe war has been costly, with billions of dollars being spent, which could be better allocated to address domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, public education, and healthcare. It's illogical to prioritize funding a foreign war when these pressing issues demand attention. The money being spent could be more effectively used to improve the lives of citizens at home, rather than sacrificing lives in a foreign war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "To clarify, I'd like to ask if you're saying that a life was saved because someone discovered some information online that prevented a potentially threatening situation. I understand that when you share information on the internet, you're essentially making it available for anyone to see. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, you have to accept others as friends, which implies giving them permission to view your profile. \n\nThis raises questions about the balance between online safety and invasion of privacy. While it's impractical to have someone monitor all students' profiles, it's also problematic if schools are only focusing on certain individuals. However, if someone is actively searching for information, it's a different story. The concern then becomes whether they're genuinely looking for evidence of potential threats or just browsing randomly.\n\nPersonally, I'm uneasy about sharing personal details online, even though I have a Facebook account. I've seen examples of people exploiting social media for malicious purposes. For instance, someone might use a person's screen name and instant messaging to deceive them into meeting. This raises concerns about online safety and the potential for stalking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share on social media, but it's hard to strike a balance between being cautious and being able to connect with friends. It's difficult to know who can access your information, even if you only accept people you know.\n\nI recall hearing about a story where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts. It struck me as unusual, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what students could or couldn't have online. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure if it's a matter of privacy or something else entirely.",
            "There's a certain irony in discussing the Iraq War, given my own stance on the matter. I hesitate to join those who claim to have been against it from the beginning, as I was indeed opposed to it, but I don't think it's as significant now, considering the widespread consensus that the war was a bad idea, except within the administration. Looking at recent polls from the US, Iraq, and globally, it's clear that a significant majority of the world's population, around 75-80%, views the war as a mistake. Notably, 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops in the region believe that the war was a poor decision and that the US should withdraw within a year. \n\nThe situation in Iraq was already a disaster before the US involvement, and the situation has only worsened since. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries create significant barriers to understanding and resolving issues in the region. It's unrealistic to expect democracy to be easily imposed on a culture that might not naturally adopt it. Although Saddam was a bad leader, weighing the pros and cons of invading a country that would likely become a disaster was crucial. \n\nGiven the circumstances, it's challenging to see a compelling reason to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I struggle to see why we shouldn't leave now, especially considering that a significant number of Iraqis – including those we're trying to help – want us to leave within the year or immediately. If we ask them and they tell us to leave, it would be clearer that the responsibility for any negative outcome wouldn't lie with the US. \n\nIf we were to leave, we might at least be seen as trying to do the right thing, rather than perpetuating the current problematic situation. Although we'll never be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, it would be better than our current position.",
            "In the United States, it's clear that gender-based discrimination still persists in various aspects of society. While this issue affects both men and women, women often face significant challenges due to the 'glass ceiling' that hinders them from achieving equality. Women may have the qualifications and skills required for a particular position, but they may be overlooked for promotion simply because it's a historically male-dominated field, and society's biases are deeply ingrained. This is particularly evident in industries like business, where women are often expected to be subordinate to men.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations can also affect men who choose to stay at home and care for their children. Men who take on this role are often looked down upon and viewed as unconventional, as traditional societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for men who choose to defy these expectations.\n\nIn other industries, such as fashion, men who are interested in the field may face skepticism and prejudice due to societal stereotypes. For instance, men who work in fashion may be doubted and scrutinized simply because they are men, and people may question their understanding of the industry. However, this is beginning to change as people become more accepting and open-minded.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote awareness and understanding of the qualities and strengths of individuals who have traditionally been marginalized. Rather than forcing change, it's crucial to encourage a more nuanced and inclusive approach that celebrates diversity and challenges societal norms. By promoting acceptance and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nFurthermore, it's also essential to recognize that discrimination can occur within the same gender, depending on factors like education, background, or geographic location. For example, individuals from rural areas with limited access to education may face prejudice from those from more affluent areas who have had better opportunities. This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address inequality.",
            "My understanding is that by decriminalizing marijuana, it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where individuals are issued a citation rather than facing arrest and prosecution. This change can have significant long-term implications, such as affecting job prospects and other opportunities, which are often the most critical consequences of a drug charge. However, proponents of decriminalization argue that the cost of enforcing strict marijuana laws is substantial, including the expenses associated with arrest, booking, and court proceedings. This is particularly relevant for cash-strapped municipalities that may not have the financial resources to pursue such measures, even if it would ultimately save them money in the long run.\n\nIn places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization seems like a viable option. By decriminalizing marijuana, these cities can redirect the funds previously spent on enforcement towards more pressing issues, such as education, social programs, and assistance for the homeless. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use, including its impact on motor skills and overall lifestyle. While some argue that marijuana has a more significant influence on people's behavior, others claim that alcohol has a more detrimental effect on motor skills. Ultimately, individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of negative consequences.",
            "I would agree with this assessment.  The Catholic Church often adheres to traditional practices, which can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability.  However, it's equally crucial for the church to be open to change and adapt to the evolving needs of its members. \n\nSome people believe that the church's rigid adherence to its doctrine can lead to exclusivity and intolerance, particularly towards those who do not conform to Catholic teachings or belong to other faiths.  For instance, my family's experience showed that the church would not perform a marriage between two individuals from different denominations, despite the importance of love and acceptance.\n\nThis sense of hypocrisy can be disheartening, as the Catholic Church preaches love and compassion but fails to live up to these values in practice.  It's puzzling that the church clings to outdated practices, failing to recognize the need for reform.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it could be beneficial, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of child abuse.  Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be directly linked to marital status.  It's likely that individuals who engage in such behavior would continue to do so regardless of their marital status. \n\nIn conclusion, it's essential for the church to balance tradition and modernity, as well as to focus on creating a more inclusive environment that promotes love, acceptance, and compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue, and I don't have a strong opinion on whether one side is right or wrong. However, I believe that this topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between the separation of church and state, as well as defining what constitutes a marriage. It's difficult to approach this topic without offending someone or group.\n\nIn my opinion, all marriages should be viewed as civil unions, regardless of whether they are considered sacraments or not. This is because marriage is essentially a union between two individuals, and the government shouldn't intervene in matters that are typically considered personal and private. If two people decide to enter into a union, they should be treated equally under the law, without any additional scrutiny based on their religious affiliations.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, it's really just about two individuals forming a union, and they should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as anyone else in a civil union. I think it's unnecessary for states to come to a consensus on this issue and then push for federal legislation, as it's not a significant enough concern to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn fact, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it's a matter that affects a relatively small group of people. The constitution should not be changed to accommodate a minority view, especially when it doesn't align with the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our country is built upon.\n\nIn summary, the issue of gay marriage is not significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's best to view all marriages as civil unions, without any additional considerations based on religious beliefs or affiliations.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household had a complex impact on my views on homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I might not fully agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I believe the decision should be left to individual states rather than being imposed by the federal government. \n\nThis approach makes sense, considering the diverse views within different states, with many being democratic and others more conservative. In a democratic state, residents likely support gay marriage, and it's reasonable to accept their decision if they choose to legalize it. By living in a particular state, individuals implicitly agree to abide by its laws and policies.\n\nI believe individuals of all orientations should have equal opportunities, and it's only fair that each state has the autonomy to decide on the issue of gay marriage. It's not up to the federal government, such as a president, to dictate the laws of every state. A president, like Bush, should not have the authority to impose their views on the entire nation, especially if they don't live in every state and will eventually leave office.\n\nUltimately, I think certain decisions should be left to the discretion of individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices. This approach would prevent a constant back-and-forth on the issue, with decisions being reversed by subsequent administrations. By giving states the freedom to decide, we can respect their unique perspectives and allow them to create laws that work best for their residents.",
            "The speaker begins by acknowledging that social media platforms like Myspace are public spaces where users post content for others to see. They argue that if a student posts something on Myspace, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, even if it's not under the school's official name, because they could still access it from home. The speaker believes that school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, which includes monitoring potential threats, such as student behavior that could lead to a school shooting.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that monitoring students' online activities can be an invasion of privacy. They draw a distinction between monitoring student behavior that's intended to catch students doing something wrong and monitoring that's aimed at preventing harm or making the school a safer place. The speaker suggests that the latter is acceptable, even if it means school officials are accessing private online content.\n\nThe speaker compares this to a lockdown drill, which is a measure implemented to ensure student safety, particularly in the wake of a terrorist attack. They see school officials' actions in this case as a similar attempt to prevent harm and make the school a safer place. The speaker concludes that, in their opinion, it's reasonable for school officials to monitor student online activities if it's done to prevent harm and maintain a safe environment.\n\nThe speaker also notes that once content is posted online, it's difficult to control who sees it, and it can come back to haunt the poster in the future. They suggest that students should be cautious when posting online, anticipating that their content may be discovered and used against them.\n\nOverall, the speaker's opinion is that school officials' actions were justified in this case, as they were aimed at preventing harm and maintaining a safe environment for students.",
            "Initially, I had strong support for going to war after 9/11, as it was a personal and emotional issue for me. However, I soon realized that we were not adequately prepared and lacked a clear plan for the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that our decision to invade was driven more by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a well-thought-out strategy. As a result, our involvement in the war ultimately backfired, and we failed to achieve our goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in that region are so consumed by internal conflicts that they cannot possibly focus on fighting against us. It's almost as if they're fighting a war within themselves, and it's pointless for us to try to impose our will on them. I've come to a point where I've lost interest in the situation, and I don't think it's our place to try to change them.\n\nOne of the main problems with our approach was that we didn't fully understand the culture and mindset of the people we were fighting against. War is a vastly different concept for them than it is for us, and it's often driven by tribal and primal instincts rather than a desire to build a better country.\n\nI think we were initially driven by a desire for revenge and a sense of moral duty, rather than a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I can understand his motivations, I think we could have handled the situation differently. We could have taken a more measured approach, with a clear plan and a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, our lack of unity and planning led to a series of costly mistakes. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and our actions only created more chaos and divisions. I believe that we're not equipped to change the people in that region, and they will likely always be driven by their own internal conflicts.\n\nI think it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the war and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the costs and sacrifices we're making. In the end, I believe that our continued presence will only lead to further instability, and it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties handle their own affairs."
