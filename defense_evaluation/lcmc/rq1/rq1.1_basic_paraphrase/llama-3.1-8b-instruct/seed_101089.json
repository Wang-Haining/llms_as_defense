            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may benefit from adapting its views to be more accepting and open-minded on various issues. One reason for its declining following could be its unwavering stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated. By embracing a more modern perspective, the Church might be able to prevent its followers from drifting away. \n\nMany people are becoming disenchanted with the Church's stance on these issues, leading to a growing divide between the Church's views and those of its followers. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable adhering to a doctrine that vehemently opposes these rights. Similarly, the Church's stance on female priests and married priests can also be a point of contention.\n\nIt's worth noting that allowing married priests or female priests might not necessarily have prevented historical events, such as those related to child abuse. However, it's difficult to say with certainty what the outcome would have been. \n\nA more progressive stance on these issues might make the Church more appealing to those who value inclusivity and acceptance. The idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but people in other professions have both their work and personal lives. It's reasonable to expect the same from priests, who are human beings with their own needs and relationships.",
            "I'm neutral towards gay marriage, but I do believe that people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose. It's not something that I think is a conscious decision, but rather a natural aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I don't think individuals should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It wouldn't be right to deny two people of the same sex the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation, whereas a heterosexual couple would have that right.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not a matter of choice, but rather a natural aspect of a person's nature. Just as some people are born straight, others are born gay, and it's not something that they can change. So, it wouldn't be fair to hold them accountable for something that they can't control.\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because this is a personal issue and not a matter of national security or morality. The government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives, especially when it comes to their relationships and identities. Gay people are who they are, and it's not their fault. They shouldn't be penalized for being themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a matter of personal freedom, and people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without the government imposing its will on them.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there is no valid justification for denying it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this argument is flawed. The idea that gay relationships are inherently different from heterosexual ones is a misconception. Ultimately, it's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they share many similarities.\n\nMoreover, gay couples are entitled to the same civil rights as everyone else, including property rights, healthcare, and the right to visit their partners in the hospital. Denying these rights is arbitrary and illogical, especially when scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe issue is not about gay couples wanting to get married in a church, but about being recognized as a legally binding union by the government. If we separate church and state, this issue shouldn't be a problem. However, if we allow civil unions, why not extend the same rights to marriage?\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" argument is no longer valid, as it's a form of segregation. Gay couples face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about their children adjusting to society.\n\nOne of the main concerns is how children of gay couples will be treated by their peers and society. However, this can be mitigated by educating people about the realities of gay families and promoting acceptance. In fact, cities like New York have already implemented measures to support children of gay parents.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal in all states. The idea that a single amendment can dictate moral values is misguided, as morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its own moral standards on the country without considering the diverse perspectives of its citizens.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage based on flawed assumptions about the psychological nature of homosexuality. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these theories, and it's essential to rely on scientific evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it lacks any benefits. However, I disagree with this notion. While I don't support making illicit substances available to the general public, I do think they can be beneficial for medicinal purposes. This is evident from the fact that many controlled substances, such as oxycodone and vicodin, are used in pharmacies due to their medicinal value, even though they are also restricted. Therefore, if we dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana simply because it's prohibited, it's illogical. I believe we should acknowledge and accept its medicinal properties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that marijuana is not similar to alcohol in the sense that it's only harmful when abused. While excessive consumption of both substances can lead to negative consequences, we shouldn't associate marijuana with the same level of danger. Rather than abruptly legalizing it, I think a more gradual approach would be more effective. We need to first break down the taboo surrounding marijuana, and then people might be more inclined to use it responsibly.\n\nUnfortunately, people's perceptions of marijuana are often skewed due to its illegal status. However, it's essential to recognize that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine. By re-evaluating our perceptions of marijuana, we may be able to promote responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern world, and its strictness has decreased over time.  I recall attending church every Sunday as a child, dressing up in matching outfits and attending a traditional service. However, I've noticed that the church has become more casual, even during services that were once formal. For instance, the recent introduction of a 30-minute teen mass and the relaxed dress code, which includes jeans and casual wear, especially during summer when people attend in beach attire. This shift towards a more casual atmosphere has become more pronounced even in morning masses.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is more complex than just a matter of marital status or professional choices; it's a deeply ingrained trait that may be influenced by genetics. Research suggests that people with a predisposition to pedophilia are often born with it, and it's not solely the result of their upbringing or environment. I think it's unfair to assume that allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have addressed this issue, as the underlying issue lies in the individual's inherent traits.\n\nIf anything, the Catholic Church's handling of these situations is more concerning than the institution of marriage or female priests. If they knew about the incidents and chose to cover them up, that's a separate issue altogether. However, in many cases, it's likely that they were unaware of the extent of the problem. In any case, I don't think the church's rules on marriage and priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.",
            "The Iraq War still evokes a strong reaction from me. Initially, I was open to the idea, but the September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, and the invasion of Iraq was largely used as a pretext. The Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Osama Bin Laden were later proven false, which I found deeply disturbing. The war still bothers me, and I believe the Bush administration's deception of the American people on this issue is a serious issue that they have yet to acknowledge.\n\nEven Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. This, to me, constitutes a breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the constitution and its attempt to undermine it since September 11th is also concerning. I believe they were determined to go to war from the start.\n\nIt has been alleged that President Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and a desire to secure the country's energy supply. This was a covert motivation, which I find unacceptable. While I think it's time to end the war, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current plan to establish a coalition of surrounding countries to maintain order may not be effective in the long term, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and lead to more problems.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament is currently ineffective, and the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. Radical groups, including those led by Moqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, causing friction in the political process. This situation is complex and difficult to navigate.",
            "The speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq are somewhat unclear, as they seem uncertain and uninformed about the topic. At one point, they mention that the war appears pointless and was likely started as a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They suggest that the US presence in Iraq is primarily driven by a desire to establish a democracy and gain access to Iraq's oil resources. However, they argue that this goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the continued presence in Iraq is only causing more problems.\n\nThe speaker also expresses empathy for families with loved ones serving in Iraq and is torn about whether the war should end or continue. On one hand, they worry that staying in Iraq will lead to the destruction of the local culture and the growth of anti-American sentiment. On the other hand, they worry that leaving Iraq will allow the country to descend into chaos.\n\nThe speaker also brings up the example of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They suggest that President Bush's handling of the Iraq War may have similar consequences, and that it could damage his legacy.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the situation in Iraq is complex and will likely continue for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to establish laws governing the matters of religion, as it contradicts the principles of the separation of church and state, which is fundamental to the US constitution. This separation allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the country. \n\nBy attempting to make something illegal based on a particular church's views, the government would be overstepping its bounds and undermining the constitution. It would essentially be favoring one church's beliefs over another, which is not the government's role. In the US, most Catholics and Christians share similar views on this matter, but the government should not impose its will based on the opinions of a few individuals.\n\nThe concept of the separation of church and state is crucial to the country's foundation, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict religious freedom would be counterproductive and contradict the existing laws. Such an amendment would be a rare instance of government interference that restricts individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should intervene in this matter. The motivation behind pushing for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the society. The proposed amendment lacks a solid reason for its implementation and could potentially have unintended consequences, such as boosting the economy or improving society.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to make something illegal should rest with the churches, not the government. The government's role is to uphold the constitution and ensure that individual freedoms are protected, not to impose its will on people's personal choices and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War raises several concerns about the government's honesty with the American people regarding its motivations for invading the country. The US government seemed to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, creating a false narrative that blurred the lines between the two events. However, the government's actions were more about manipulating public emotions and justifying the war rather than providing a genuine reason.\n\nAs someone opposed to war, I strongly believe that a preemptive strike on Iraq was unwarranted. The war in Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from its past mistakes. The US government mistakenly believed that removing Saddam Hussein's regime would be a straightforward process, but they were unprepared for the consequences, including the loss of American lives and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government's handling of the war was particularly concerning, as they failed to plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. The attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq was a complex and long-term process, similar to the one the US underwent in its own history. The US government oversimplified the process, implying it would be a short and successful endeavor.\n\nIn reality, implementing democracy is a challenging and time-consuming process that often involves years of struggle and potential civil unrest. The US government's portrayal of the situation was overly optimistic, and they were not adequately prepared for the difficulties that followed. The war in Iraq has resulted in the loss of many American lives and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable government.\n\nOne of the key considerations in this situation is the moral obligation to see the war through to its conclusion, given the US's role in removing the Iraqi government and disrupting their way of life. However, this comes at a significant cost, including the risk of further American casualties. The US government's decision to invade Iraq was also motivated by a desire to control the country's oil resources, which raises questions about the true reasons behind the war.\n\nThe US government's decision-making process was also marred by a lack of thoroughness and transparency. The fact that they made claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false, and then failed to take action against countries like North Korea that were known to possess such weapons, further erodes trust in the government's decision-making abilities.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the Iraq War is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict when peace will be achieved. However, it is clear that the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to have a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind the war and the complexities of establishing a democratic government in a foreign country.",
            "I've always been in favor of gay marriage and believe it's a personal choice that should not be influenced by societal norms or government intervention. Recent studies have shown that sexual orientation may be determined biologically, rather than through environmental factors, which I think is a compelling argument against limiting rights based on something outside of an individual's control. I find it inhumane to deny people the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, politics and government should not have a role in determining personal relationships. Marriage is a personal matter that should be decided by the individuals involved, not by external authorities. I know of several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who are treated just like any other family, and I don't see why their relationships should be any different from those of heterosexual couples.\n\nI'm also aware of the scientific research suggesting that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical difference in the brain, rather than being the result of upbringing or environmental factors. This challenges the idea that people's sexual orientation is a choice, and I think it's essential to approach the issue with a more informed perspective.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, without the need for public scrutiny or government approval. It's ironic that a couple can get married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas without anyone being the wiser, but if two gay individuals want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle. I think this highlights the need to treat all marriages as private, personal affairs, rather than making them a matter of public interest.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes publicly accessible, and it's impossible to control who sees it. As a resident advisor, I've already dealt with this situation. Posting something online can shape people's perceptions of you, and sharing content about violent or sensitive topics can lead to serious consequences. If you post something like that, it might spread quickly, and authorities may take action. Even if you're just joking, it's hard to tell what others will consider serious or not.\n\nIn the case I'm referring to, a student overheard someone making a comment at school and reported it. When we looked into the matter, we found that the student had posted something on their social media that, in hindsight, seemed like a joke but became concerning given the situation. This highlights the issue of online privacy: once you post something online, it's no longer private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't dictate how others perceive or respond to your online content.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships. However, if a student brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy. If there's a potential threat, authorities must take it seriously. It's a different story if they're monitoring private conversations or messages. A better approach is for teachers to maintain professional boundaries online and not engage with students in ways that could lead to conflicts of interest or awkward situations.\n\nIn fact, it's best for teachers, like me, not to friend our residents or students online, as we don't want to inadvertently get drawn into their personal lives or be faced with difficult decisions that aren't our responsibility. It's essential to maintain a clear professional distance online to avoid these kinds of issues.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and I believe its initial purpose has been lost sight of. The intention was to restore democracy in another country, but I'm not convinced that's the primary motivation anymore. It's possible that the war is being prolonged simply to demonstrate our power and presence on the world stage, which I think is a questionable goal.\n\nThe original motive behind the war may have been to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, which would have been a just cause. However, if personal issues were involved, that would have undermined the legitimacy of the war. I think we made our point in the first few months, and the war's continuation for over a year or more is unwarranted.\n\nIf the goal was to overthrow a tyrannical ruler and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble reason for the war. Nevertheless, I believe our reasons for fighting have become distorted and misguided. It seems that we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, rather than achieving a decisive victory or bringing the conflict to a close.\n\nI think the war has gone on for far too long, and it's time for us to step back and allow the country to take care of itself. The billions of dollars spent on this war could be better spent addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. We have many pressing problems at home that require our attention and financial resources, and it's wasteful to continue spending on a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question regarding online safety. It seems that someone was able to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from occurring by accessing information online. This raises the issue of whether it's an invasion of privacy when someone posts personal information on social media platforms like Myspace. Since Myspace requires users to be friends with others to view their profiles, it implies that users have given permission to those individuals to see their information.\n\nIf someone posts content online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a large number of people. In this case, someone accessed the information and potentially saved a life. While it's not feasible for a single person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent such situations, it's also problematic to single out individuals for scrutiny. It's unclear how one would determine the intentions behind someone accessing a profile, whether it was a targeted search or a random discovery.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it's concerning that there are individuals who can access my information. A documentary I watched showed someone who demonstrated how easily he could gather information about a girl by accessing her online profile. He was able to obtain her screen name and engage in communication with her in a matter of minutes. I'm cautious about sharing personal details online, but I also want to maintain a social connection with friends through social media. It's a delicate balance between limiting what I share and keeping my online presence private.\n\nI've noticed that some people in my classes can identify me through my online profile, even if they don't know my screen name. They can infer information about my interests, appearance, and daily schedule. While I've attempted to limit my online presence, it's challenging to strike a balance between sharing information and maintaining privacy. I only accept people I know on social media, but it's impossible to know who else might be accessing my information.\n\nI recall hearing a story from my roommate about a high school that banned students from using Myspace. I'm unsure about the reasoning behind this decision, and I question whether it's within the school's authority to restrict students' online activities. I'm not convinced it's a clear-cut issue of privacy, but rather a matter of the school's power to regulate student behavior.\n\nThese thoughts are the only ones that come to mind in relation to this topic.",
            "It's difficult to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially when it comes to joining the chorus of those who claimed to have been against it from the start. However, the general consensus worldwide, aside from the US administration, was that the war was a bad idea. Recent polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population, including 80% of Iraqi citizens and 70% of US troops, believe the war was misguided.\n\nThe situation has been plagued by complications since the beginning, and it's challenging to find a straightforward solution. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are significant, and previous administrations have struggled to understand and adapt to these differences. The attempt to impose democracy on a region where it may not be welcomed can be problematic.\n\nWhile it's acknowledged that Saddam was a bad leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that might descend into chaos, as happened in Iraq. With no clear reason to stay in Iraq, it's puzzling why the US administration doesn't explore a more gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more. The fact that a significant majority of Iraqis, including those the US is trying to help, want the US out within a year raises questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy.\n\nIf the US were to ask the Iraqis for their opinion and they said they wanted the US to leave, it would shift the responsibility for any future outcomes. In this scenario, if things went awry, the US could argue that it was the Iraqi people who made the decision to leave, rather than the US. This could potentially improve the US's position in the region, even if it's unlikely to make them the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "While I believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States, I think it's essential to note that this issue transcends solely being a women's concern. It's also deeply intertwined with the specific field or industry one is working in. In general, women often face more significant obstacles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite equality being touted, women struggle to find recognition and promotion opportunities because of deeply ingrained societal attitudes. Historically, women have been underrepresented in senior business positions, leading some boards to overlook qualified female candidates for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women. Men, particularly those in non-traditional fields like fashion, also face prejudice. For instance, men who stay at home to care for their children often face societal disapproval, as traditional roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nSocietal attitudes towards gender roles are complex and vary depending on the industry or location. While progress has been made, change is a gradual process. I believe that promoting understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped can help alleviate some of these biases. It's essential to strike a balance between promoting change and avoiding resistance, which can occur if the pace is too rapid. Ultimately, we're making progress, and it's crucial to continue working towards a more inclusive society.\n\nInterestingly, discrimination can also occur within the same gender, depending on factors like upbringing, profession, or geographical location. For example, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional background may face prejudice from city-dwellers who view them as less sophisticated due to their grammar or mannerisms. This highlights the complexity of societal attitudes and the need for continued education and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making marijuana illegal, they chose to decriminalize it. This means it's no longer considered a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, similar to receiving a traffic ticket. This change removes the severe consequences often associated with a drug charge, such as arrest, imprisonment, and a permanent record that can hinder future opportunities. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term effects of a marijuana charge can still be a concern for individuals, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are financial benefits to decriminalizing marijuana. The costs of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for minor marijuana offenses can be substantial, and can divert funds away from more pressing community needs. In communities where resources are limited, decriminalization can be a practical solution to free up money for essential services like education, social programs, and aid for the homeless.\n\nDenver, with its more liberal attitude towards marijuana, is a prime example of a city that has benefited financially from decriminalization. The extra funds have allowed the city to invest in initiatives that improve the quality of life for its citizens. While some people may still be hesitant about the idea of widespread marijuana use, it's essential to consider the financial and social implications of a substance's legalization.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, it's difficult to generalize its effects on individuals, as people react differently to the substance. Some may be able to use it responsibly, while others may struggle with its impact on their lifestyle. Similarly, both marijuana and alcohol can have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I would say that yes, but. Many traditional practices in the Catholic Church remain unchanged over time, which is good for continuity. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they must attend church regularly and follow their doctrine strictly, which can sometimes lead to judging those who don't conform. Unfortunately, the Church often rejects individuals who don't perfectly follow their teachings or belong to other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents, one of whom was an Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This lack of tolerance is contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church's actions often contradict its principles, making it seem outdated. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's a good idea, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of pedophilia. People who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, as it involves exploiting a child, not an adult partner. Therefore, allowing priests to marry would not be a significant deterrent. \n\nIn general, I don't think permitting priests to be married would prevent child abuse, as such behavior is often driven by other factors. It's possible that it would continue to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and it's challenging to take a stance without offending someone. The conflict between separating church and state, combined with the difficulty in defining marriage, makes this topic particularly tricky. I'm not sure if marriage should be governed by the government or if it's a sacrament that should be left to individual beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, civil unions could be a feasible alternative to marriage, as they would provide equal rights without the label of marriage. It's essential to separate personal beliefs from state recognition, and the government shouldn't dictate the type of marriage. Two individuals in a committed relationship should have the same rights and benefits, regardless of whether they're married or in a civil union.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is a complex one, but it ultimately boils down to two people committing to each other in a civil union. If a logical consensus can be reached among the states, it would be more productive to push for federal legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. A constitutional amendment should be reserved for significant, far-reaching issues that affect the entire nation, and this topic doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nIn essence, it's not essential to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage; it's a matter of providing equal rights and benefits to all citizens, regardless of their marital status or orientation.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, but my exposure to gay friends has created a nuanced perspective. While I don't fully agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a federal issue, but rather something that should be decided at the state level. This approach respects the diverse opinions across different regions, such as Democratic and Republican states. Individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local laws and decisions, even if they differ from their personal views. My position is that homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals, and this should be determined by each state's discretion. I also disagree with a national ban on gay marriage and believe it should be up to individual states to decide their own policies. A president, such as Bush, shouldn't impose their views on the entire country, as they don't live in every state and their decisions won't last forever. Ultimately, state governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that affect their residents, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker begins by downplaying the significance of their initial hesitation to weigh in on the issue, but eventually shares their thoughts on the matter. They view Myspace, a public platform, as a place where users post content intended for the public to see. The speaker acknowledges that posting on the internet comes with the understanding that it will be accessible to anyone, including school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, the speaker believes that school officials have the right to monitor student activity, even if it's not directly related to the school's official name. They feel that officials could still access the content through students' homes. The speaker also suggests that school officials may use social media to identify students engaging in prohibited behavior, such as underage drinking or smoking.\n\nHowever, the speaker has reservations about schools monitoring students' online activity solely for the purpose of getting them in trouble. They consider this an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, they believe that monitoring can be justified if it's done to prevent harm or make the school a safer environment.\n\nThe speaker shares a personal anecdote about a teacher discussing the importance of ensuring student safety, including conducting lockdown drills and drills in response to potential terrorist threats. They draw a connection between these drills and the school's efforts to prevent a school shooting. The speaker concludes that the school officials in this case were acting to prevent a tragedy, much like the ones that have occurred at schools like Columbine.\n\nUltimately, the speaker reiterates that they don't think monitoring is an invasion of privacy if it's done to prevent harm or improve school safety.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of going to war after 9/11 because I had a personal connection to the event. However, upon further reflection, I believe we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into the conflict without a solid plan. This decision seemed to be driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a thoughtful approach. As a result, we may have inadvertently made matters worse.\n\nI now strongly oppose the war, and I think it was a misguided endeavor. I believe that as long as the local parties are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't have expected to impose our will on them and expect them to cooperate. Unfortunately, our involvement in their conflict has led me to become desensitized to the situation, and I struggle to see them as fellow human beings.\n\nThe nature of war in their culture is vastly different from ours, and I don't think they were motivated by a desire to improve their country, but rather to expel us. I think it would have been wiser for us to leave them to their own devices, rather than attempting to impose our will. Our objectives were unclear, and we were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a rational consideration of the consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq may have been understandable given the circumstances, but I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan for the occupation.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we were more focused on exacting revenge than on creating a lasting solution. I don't believe we were equipped to handle the complexity of their culture and the local dynamics. We lacked unity and a clear understanding of our objectives, which ultimately hindered our progress. I don't think we can change the people of the region; they are who they are, and we should accept that.\n\nIn my opinion, we're not making enough progress in the region, and our continued presence is more detrimental to ourselves than to the locals. I fear that even if we stay for a long time, the moment we leave, the situation will collapse, and we'll be no better off. I believe it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties resolve their issues without our interference."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may benefit from adapting its views to be more accepting and open-minded on various issues. One reason for its declining following could be its unwavering stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated. By embracing a more modern perspective, the Church might be able to prevent its followers from drifting away. \n\nMany people are becoming disenchanted with the Church's stance on these issues, leading to a growing divide between the Church's views and those of its followers. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable adhering to a doctrine that vehemently opposes these rights. Similarly, the Church's stance on female priests and married priests can also be a point of contention.\n\nIt's worth noting that allowing married priests or female priests might not necessarily have prevented historical events, such as those related to child abuse. However, it's difficult to say with certainty what the outcome would have been. \n\nA more progressive stance on these issues might make the Church more appealing to those who value inclusivity and acceptance. The idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but people in other professions have both their work and personal lives. It's reasonable to expect the same from priests, who are human beings with their own needs and relationships.",
            "I'm neutral towards gay marriage, but I do believe that people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose. It's not something that I think is a conscious decision, but rather a natural aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I don't think individuals should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It wouldn't be right to deny two people of the same sex the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation, whereas a heterosexual couple would have that right.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not a matter of choice, but rather a natural aspect of a person's nature. Just as some people are born straight, others are born gay, and it's not something that they can change. So, it wouldn't be fair to hold them accountable for something that they can't control.\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because this is a personal issue and not a matter of national security or morality. The government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives, especially when it comes to their relationships and identities. Gay people are who they are, and it's not their fault. They shouldn't be penalized for being themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a matter of personal freedom, and people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without the government imposing its will on them.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there is no valid justification for denying it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this argument is flawed. The idea that gay relationships are inherently different from heterosexual ones is a misconception. Ultimately, it's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they share many similarities.\n\nMoreover, gay couples are entitled to the same civil rights as everyone else, including property rights, healthcare, and the right to visit their partners in the hospital. Denying these rights is arbitrary and illogical, especially when scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe issue is not about gay couples wanting to get married in a church, but about being recognized as a legally binding union by the government. If we separate church and state, this issue shouldn't be a problem. However, if we allow civil unions, why not extend the same rights to marriage?\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" argument is no longer valid, as it's a form of segregation. Gay couples face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about their children adjusting to society.\n\nOne of the main concerns is how children of gay couples will be treated by their peers and society. However, this can be mitigated by educating people about the realities of gay families and promoting acceptance. In fact, cities like New York have already implemented measures to support children of gay parents.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal in all states. The idea that a single amendment can dictate moral values is misguided, as morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its own moral standards on the country without considering the diverse perspectives of its citizens.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage based on flawed assumptions about the psychological nature of homosexuality. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these theories, and it's essential to rely on scientific evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it lacks any benefits. However, I disagree with this notion. While I don't support making illicit substances available to the general public, I do think they can be beneficial for medicinal purposes. This is evident from the fact that many controlled substances, such as oxycodone and vicodin, are used in pharmacies due to their medicinal value, even though they are also restricted. Therefore, if we dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana simply because it's prohibited, it's illogical. I believe we should acknowledge and accept its medicinal properties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that marijuana is not similar to alcohol in the sense that it's only harmful when abused. While excessive consumption of both substances can lead to negative consequences, we shouldn't associate marijuana with the same level of danger. Rather than abruptly legalizing it, I think a more gradual approach would be more effective. We need to first break down the taboo surrounding marijuana, and then people might be more inclined to use it responsibly.\n\nUnfortunately, people's perceptions of marijuana are often skewed due to its illegal status. However, it's essential to recognize that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine. By re-evaluating our perceptions of marijuana, we may be able to promote responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern world, and its strictness has decreased over time.  I recall attending church every Sunday as a child, dressing up in matching outfits and attending a traditional service. However, I've noticed that the church has become more casual, even during services that were once formal. For instance, the recent introduction of a 30-minute teen mass and the relaxed dress code, which includes jeans and casual wear, especially during summer when people attend in beach attire. This shift towards a more casual atmosphere has become more pronounced even in morning masses.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is more complex than just a matter of marital status or professional choices; it's a deeply ingrained trait that may be influenced by genetics. Research suggests that people with a predisposition to pedophilia are often born with it, and it's not solely the result of their upbringing or environment. I think it's unfair to assume that allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have addressed this issue, as the underlying issue lies in the individual's inherent traits.\n\nIf anything, the Catholic Church's handling of these situations is more concerning than the institution of marriage or female priests. If they knew about the incidents and chose to cover them up, that's a separate issue altogether. However, in many cases, it's likely that they were unaware of the extent of the problem. In any case, I don't think the church's rules on marriage and priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.",
            "The Iraq War still evokes a strong reaction from me. Initially, I was open to the idea, but the September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, and the invasion of Iraq was largely used as a pretext. The Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Osama Bin Laden were later proven false, which I found deeply disturbing. The war still bothers me, and I believe the Bush administration's deception of the American people on this issue is a serious issue that they have yet to acknowledge.\n\nEven Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. This, to me, constitutes a breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the constitution and its attempt to undermine it since September 11th is also concerning. I believe they were determined to go to war from the start.\n\nIt has been alleged that President Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and a desire to secure the country's energy supply. This was a covert motivation, which I find unacceptable. While I think it's time to end the war, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current plan to establish a coalition of surrounding countries to maintain order may not be effective in the long term, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and lead to more problems.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament is currently ineffective, and the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. Radical groups, including those led by Moqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, causing friction in the political process. This situation is complex and difficult to navigate.",
            "The speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq are somewhat unclear, as they seem uncertain and uninformed about the topic. At one point, they mention that the war appears pointless and was likely started as a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They suggest that the US presence in Iraq is primarily driven by a desire to establish a democracy and gain access to Iraq's oil resources. However, they argue that this goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the continued presence in Iraq is only causing more problems.\n\nThe speaker also expresses empathy for families with loved ones serving in Iraq and is torn about whether the war should end or continue. On one hand, they worry that staying in Iraq will lead to the destruction of the local culture and the growth of anti-American sentiment. On the other hand, they worry that leaving Iraq will allow the country to descend into chaos.\n\nThe speaker also brings up the example of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They suggest that President Bush's handling of the Iraq War may have similar consequences, and that it could damage his legacy.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the situation in Iraq is complex and will likely continue for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to establish laws governing the matters of religion, as it contradicts the principles of the separation of church and state, which is fundamental to the US constitution. This separation allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the country. \n\nBy attempting to make something illegal based on a particular church's views, the government would be overstepping its bounds and undermining the constitution. It would essentially be favoring one church's beliefs over another, which is not the government's role. In the US, most Catholics and Christians share similar views on this matter, but the government should not impose its will based on the opinions of a few individuals.\n\nThe concept of the separation of church and state is crucial to the country's foundation, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict religious freedom would be counterproductive and contradict the existing laws. Such an amendment would be a rare instance of government interference that restricts individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should intervene in this matter. The motivation behind pushing for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the society. The proposed amendment lacks a solid reason for its implementation and could potentially have unintended consequences, such as boosting the economy or improving society.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to make something illegal should rest with the churches, not the government. The government's role is to uphold the constitution and ensure that individual freedoms are protected, not to impose its will on people's personal choices and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War raises several concerns about the government's honesty with the American people regarding its motivations for invading the country. The US government seemed to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, creating a false narrative that blurred the lines between the two events. However, the government's actions were more about manipulating public emotions and justifying the war rather than providing a genuine reason.\n\nAs someone opposed to war, I strongly believe that a preemptive strike on Iraq was unwarranted. The war in Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from its past mistakes. The US government mistakenly believed that removing Saddam Hussein's regime would be a straightforward process, but they were unprepared for the consequences, including the loss of American lives and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government's handling of the war was particularly concerning, as they failed to plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. The attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq was a complex and long-term process, similar to the one the US underwent in its own history. The US government oversimplified the process, implying it would be a short and successful endeavor.\n\nIn reality, implementing democracy is a challenging and time-consuming process that often involves years of struggle and potential civil unrest. The US government's portrayal of the situation was overly optimistic, and they were not adequately prepared for the difficulties that followed. The war in Iraq has resulted in the loss of many American lives and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable government.\n\nOne of the key considerations in this situation is the moral obligation to see the war through to its conclusion, given the US's role in removing the Iraqi government and disrupting their way of life. However, this comes at a significant cost, including the risk of further American casualties. The US government's decision to invade Iraq was also motivated by a desire to control the country's oil resources, which raises questions about the true reasons behind the war.\n\nThe US government's decision-making process was also marred by a lack of thoroughness and transparency. The fact that they made claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false, and then failed to take action against countries like North Korea that were known to possess such weapons, further erodes trust in the government's decision-making abilities.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the Iraq War is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict when peace will be achieved. However, it is clear that the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to have a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind the war and the complexities of establishing a democratic government in a foreign country.",
            "I've always been in favor of gay marriage and believe it's a personal choice that should not be influenced by societal norms or government intervention. Recent studies have shown that sexual orientation may be determined biologically, rather than through environmental factors, which I think is a compelling argument against limiting rights based on something outside of an individual's control. I find it inhumane to deny people the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, politics and government should not have a role in determining personal relationships. Marriage is a personal matter that should be decided by the individuals involved, not by external authorities. I know of several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who are treated just like any other family, and I don't see why their relationships should be any different from those of heterosexual couples.\n\nI'm also aware of the scientific research suggesting that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical difference in the brain, rather than being the result of upbringing or environmental factors. This challenges the idea that people's sexual orientation is a choice, and I think it's essential to approach the issue with a more informed perspective.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, without the need for public scrutiny or government approval. It's ironic that a couple can get married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas without anyone being the wiser, but if two gay individuals want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle. I think this highlights the need to treat all marriages as private, personal affairs, rather than making them a matter of public interest.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes publicly accessible, and it's impossible to control who sees it. As a resident advisor, I've already dealt with this situation. Posting something online can shape people's perceptions of you, and sharing content about violent or sensitive topics can lead to serious consequences. If you post something like that, it might spread quickly, and authorities may take action. Even if you're just joking, it's hard to tell what others will consider serious or not.\n\nIn the case I'm referring to, a student overheard someone making a comment at school and reported it. When we looked into the matter, we found that the student had posted something on their social media that, in hindsight, seemed like a joke but became concerning given the situation. This highlights the issue of online privacy: once you post something online, it's no longer private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't dictate how others perceive or respond to your online content.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships. However, if a student brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy. If there's a potential threat, authorities must take it seriously. It's a different story if they're monitoring private conversations or messages. A better approach is for teachers to maintain professional boundaries online and not engage with students in ways that could lead to conflicts of interest or awkward situations.\n\nIn fact, it's best for teachers, like me, not to friend our residents or students online, as we don't want to inadvertently get drawn into their personal lives or be faced with difficult decisions that aren't our responsibility. It's essential to maintain a clear professional distance online to avoid these kinds of issues.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and I believe its initial purpose has been lost sight of. The intention was to restore democracy in another country, but I'm not convinced that's the primary motivation anymore. It's possible that the war is being prolonged simply to demonstrate our power and presence on the world stage, which I think is a questionable goal.\n\nThe original motive behind the war may have been to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, which would have been a just cause. However, if personal issues were involved, that would have undermined the legitimacy of the war. I think we made our point in the first few months, and the war's continuation for over a year or more is unwarranted.\n\nIf the goal was to overthrow a tyrannical ruler and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble reason for the war. Nevertheless, I believe our reasons for fighting have become distorted and misguided. It seems that we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, rather than achieving a decisive victory or bringing the conflict to a close.\n\nI think the war has gone on for far too long, and it's time for us to step back and allow the country to take care of itself. The billions of dollars spent on this war could be better spent addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. We have many pressing problems at home that require our attention and financial resources, and it's wasteful to continue spending on a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question regarding online safety. It seems that someone was able to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from occurring by accessing information online. This raises the issue of whether it's an invasion of privacy when someone posts personal information on social media platforms like Myspace. Since Myspace requires users to be friends with others to view their profiles, it implies that users have given permission to those individuals to see their information.\n\nIf someone posts content online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a large number of people. In this case, someone accessed the information and potentially saved a life. While it's not feasible for a single person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent such situations, it's also problematic to single out individuals for scrutiny. It's unclear how one would determine the intentions behind someone accessing a profile, whether it was a targeted search or a random discovery.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it's concerning that there are individuals who can access my information. A documentary I watched showed someone who demonstrated how easily he could gather information about a girl by accessing her online profile. He was able to obtain her screen name and engage in communication with her in a matter of minutes. I'm cautious about sharing personal details online, but I also want to maintain a social connection with friends through social media. It's a delicate balance between limiting what I share and keeping my online presence private.\n\nI've noticed that some people in my classes can identify me through my online profile, even if they don't know my screen name. They can infer information about my interests, appearance, and daily schedule. While I've attempted to limit my online presence, it's challenging to strike a balance between sharing information and maintaining privacy. I only accept people I know on social media, but it's impossible to know who else might be accessing my information.\n\nI recall hearing a story from my roommate about a high school that banned students from using Myspace. I'm unsure about the reasoning behind this decision, and I question whether it's within the school's authority to restrict students' online activities. I'm not convinced it's a clear-cut issue of privacy, but rather a matter of the school's power to regulate student behavior.\n\nThese thoughts are the only ones that come to mind in relation to this topic.",
            "It's difficult to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially when it comes to joining the chorus of those who claimed to have been against it from the start. However, the general consensus worldwide, aside from the US administration, was that the war was a bad idea. Recent polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population, including 80% of Iraqi citizens and 70% of US troops, believe the war was misguided.\n\nThe situation has been plagued by complications since the beginning, and it's challenging to find a straightforward solution. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are significant, and previous administrations have struggled to understand and adapt to these differences. The attempt to impose democracy on a region where it may not be welcomed can be problematic.\n\nWhile it's acknowledged that Saddam was a bad leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that might descend into chaos, as happened in Iraq. With no clear reason to stay in Iraq, it's puzzling why the US administration doesn't explore a more gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more. The fact that a significant majority of Iraqis, including those the US is trying to help, want the US out within a year raises questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy.\n\nIf the US were to ask the Iraqis for their opinion and they said they wanted the US to leave, it would shift the responsibility for any future outcomes. In this scenario, if things went awry, the US could argue that it was the Iraqi people who made the decision to leave, rather than the US. This could potentially improve the US's position in the region, even if it's unlikely to make them the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "While I believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States, I think it's essential to note that this issue transcends solely being a women's concern. It's also deeply intertwined with the specific field or industry one is working in. In general, women often face more significant obstacles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite equality being touted, women struggle to find recognition and promotion opportunities because of deeply ingrained societal attitudes. Historically, women have been underrepresented in senior business positions, leading some boards to overlook qualified female candidates for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women. Men, particularly those in non-traditional fields like fashion, also face prejudice. For instance, men who stay at home to care for their children often face societal disapproval, as traditional roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nSocietal attitudes towards gender roles are complex and vary depending on the industry or location. While progress has been made, change is a gradual process. I believe that promoting understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped can help alleviate some of these biases. It's essential to strike a balance between promoting change and avoiding resistance, which can occur if the pace is too rapid. Ultimately, we're making progress, and it's crucial to continue working towards a more inclusive society.\n\nInterestingly, discrimination can also occur within the same gender, depending on factors like upbringing, profession, or geographical location. For example, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional background may face prejudice from city-dwellers who view them as less sophisticated due to their grammar or mannerisms. This highlights the complexity of societal attitudes and the need for continued education and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making marijuana illegal, they chose to decriminalize it. This means it's no longer considered a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, similar to receiving a traffic ticket. This change removes the severe consequences often associated with a drug charge, such as arrest, imprisonment, and a permanent record that can hinder future opportunities. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term effects of a marijuana charge can still be a concern for individuals, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are financial benefits to decriminalizing marijuana. The costs of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for minor marijuana offenses can be substantial, and can divert funds away from more pressing community needs. In communities where resources are limited, decriminalization can be a practical solution to free up money for essential services like education, social programs, and aid for the homeless.\n\nDenver, with its more liberal attitude towards marijuana, is a prime example of a city that has benefited financially from decriminalization. The extra funds have allowed the city to invest in initiatives that improve the quality of life for its citizens. While some people may still be hesitant about the idea of widespread marijuana use, it's essential to consider the financial and social implications of a substance's legalization.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, it's difficult to generalize its effects on individuals, as people react differently to the substance. Some may be able to use it responsibly, while others may struggle with its impact on their lifestyle. Similarly, both marijuana and alcohol can have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I would say that yes, but. Many traditional practices in the Catholic Church remain unchanged over time, which is good for continuity. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they must attend church regularly and follow their doctrine strictly, which can sometimes lead to judging those who don't conform. Unfortunately, the Church often rejects individuals who don't perfectly follow their teachings or belong to other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents, one of whom was an Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This lack of tolerance is contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church's actions often contradict its principles, making it seem outdated. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's a good idea, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of pedophilia. People who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, as it involves exploiting a child, not an adult partner. Therefore, allowing priests to marry would not be a significant deterrent. \n\nIn general, I don't think permitting priests to be married would prevent child abuse, as such behavior is often driven by other factors. It's possible that it would continue to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and it's challenging to take a stance without offending someone. The conflict between separating church and state, combined with the difficulty in defining marriage, makes this topic particularly tricky. I'm not sure if marriage should be governed by the government or if it's a sacrament that should be left to individual beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, civil unions could be a feasible alternative to marriage, as they would provide equal rights without the label of marriage. It's essential to separate personal beliefs from state recognition, and the government shouldn't dictate the type of marriage. Two individuals in a committed relationship should have the same rights and benefits, regardless of whether they're married or in a civil union.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is a complex one, but it ultimately boils down to two people committing to each other in a civil union. If a logical consensus can be reached among the states, it would be more productive to push for federal legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. A constitutional amendment should be reserved for significant, far-reaching issues that affect the entire nation, and this topic doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nIn essence, it's not essential to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage; it's a matter of providing equal rights and benefits to all citizens, regardless of their marital status or orientation.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, but my exposure to gay friends has created a nuanced perspective. While I don't fully agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a federal issue, but rather something that should be decided at the state level. This approach respects the diverse opinions across different regions, such as Democratic and Republican states. Individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local laws and decisions, even if they differ from their personal views. My position is that homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals, and this should be determined by each state's discretion. I also disagree with a national ban on gay marriage and believe it should be up to individual states to decide their own policies. A president, such as Bush, shouldn't impose their views on the entire country, as they don't live in every state and their decisions won't last forever. Ultimately, state governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that affect their residents, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker begins by downplaying the significance of their initial hesitation to weigh in on the issue, but eventually shares their thoughts on the matter. They view Myspace, a public platform, as a place where users post content intended for the public to see. The speaker acknowledges that posting on the internet comes with the understanding that it will be accessible to anyone, including school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, the speaker believes that school officials have the right to monitor student activity, even if it's not directly related to the school's official name. They feel that officials could still access the content through students' homes. The speaker also suggests that school officials may use social media to identify students engaging in prohibited behavior, such as underage drinking or smoking.\n\nHowever, the speaker has reservations about schools monitoring students' online activity solely for the purpose of getting them in trouble. They consider this an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, they believe that monitoring can be justified if it's done to prevent harm or make the school a safer environment.\n\nThe speaker shares a personal anecdote about a teacher discussing the importance of ensuring student safety, including conducting lockdown drills and drills in response to potential terrorist threats. They draw a connection between these drills and the school's efforts to prevent a school shooting. The speaker concludes that the school officials in this case were acting to prevent a tragedy, much like the ones that have occurred at schools like Columbine.\n\nUltimately, the speaker reiterates that they don't think monitoring is an invasion of privacy if it's done to prevent harm or improve school safety.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of going to war after 9/11 because I had a personal connection to the event. However, upon further reflection, I believe we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into the conflict without a solid plan. This decision seemed to be driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a thoughtful approach. As a result, we may have inadvertently made matters worse.\n\nI now strongly oppose the war, and I think it was a misguided endeavor. I believe that as long as the local parties are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't have expected to impose our will on them and expect them to cooperate. Unfortunately, our involvement in their conflict has led me to become desensitized to the situation, and I struggle to see them as fellow human beings.\n\nThe nature of war in their culture is vastly different from ours, and I don't think they were motivated by a desire to improve their country, but rather to expel us. I think it would have been wiser for us to leave them to their own devices, rather than attempting to impose our will. Our objectives were unclear, and we were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a rational consideration of the consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq may have been understandable given the circumstances, but I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan for the occupation.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we were more focused on exacting revenge than on creating a lasting solution. I don't believe we were equipped to handle the complexity of their culture and the local dynamics. We lacked unity and a clear understanding of our objectives, which ultimately hindered our progress. I don't think we can change the people of the region; they are who they are, and we should accept that.\n\nIn my opinion, we're not making enough progress in the region, and our continued presence is more detrimental to ourselves than to the locals. I fear that even if we stay for a long time, the moment we leave, the situation will collapse, and we'll be no better off. I believe it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties resolve their issues without our interference."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may benefit from adapting its views to be more accepting and open-minded on various issues. One reason for its declining following could be its unwavering stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated. By embracing a more modern perspective, the Church might be able to prevent its followers from drifting away. \n\nMany people are becoming disenchanted with the Church's stance on these issues, leading to a growing divide between the Church's views and those of its followers. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable adhering to a doctrine that vehemently opposes these rights. Similarly, the Church's stance on female priests and married priests can also be a point of contention.\n\nIt's worth noting that allowing married priests or female priests might not necessarily have prevented historical events, such as those related to child abuse. However, it's difficult to say with certainty what the outcome would have been. \n\nA more progressive stance on these issues might make the Church more appealing to those who value inclusivity and acceptance. The idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but people in other professions have both their work and personal lives. It's reasonable to expect the same from priests, who are human beings with their own needs and relationships.",
            "I'm neutral towards gay marriage, but I do believe that people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose. It's not something that I think is a conscious decision, but rather a natural aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I don't think individuals should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It wouldn't be right to deny two people of the same sex the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation, whereas a heterosexual couple would have that right.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not a matter of choice, but rather a natural aspect of a person's nature. Just as some people are born straight, others are born gay, and it's not something that they can change. So, it wouldn't be fair to hold them accountable for something that they can't control.\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because this is a personal issue and not a matter of national security or morality. The government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives, especially when it comes to their relationships and identities. Gay people are who they are, and it's not their fault. They shouldn't be penalized for being themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a matter of personal freedom, and people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without the government imposing its will on them.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there is no valid justification for denying it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this argument is flawed. The idea that gay relationships are inherently different from heterosexual ones is a misconception. Ultimately, it's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they share many similarities.\n\nMoreover, gay couples are entitled to the same civil rights as everyone else, including property rights, healthcare, and the right to visit their partners in the hospital. Denying these rights is arbitrary and illogical, especially when scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe issue is not about gay couples wanting to get married in a church, but about being recognized as a legally binding union by the government. If we separate church and state, this issue shouldn't be a problem. However, if we allow civil unions, why not extend the same rights to marriage?\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" argument is no longer valid, as it's a form of segregation. Gay couples face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about their children adjusting to society.\n\nOne of the main concerns is how children of gay couples will be treated by their peers and society. However, this can be mitigated by educating people about the realities of gay families and promoting acceptance. In fact, cities like New York have already implemented measures to support children of gay parents.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal in all states. The idea that a single amendment can dictate moral values is misguided, as morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its own moral standards on the country without considering the diverse perspectives of its citizens.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage based on flawed assumptions about the psychological nature of homosexuality. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these theories, and it's essential to rely on scientific evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it lacks any benefits. However, I disagree with this notion. While I don't support making illicit substances available to the general public, I do think they can be beneficial for medicinal purposes. This is evident from the fact that many controlled substances, such as oxycodone and vicodin, are used in pharmacies due to their medicinal value, even though they are also restricted. Therefore, if we dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana simply because it's prohibited, it's illogical. I believe we should acknowledge and accept its medicinal properties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that marijuana is not similar to alcohol in the sense that it's only harmful when abused. While excessive consumption of both substances can lead to negative consequences, we shouldn't associate marijuana with the same level of danger. Rather than abruptly legalizing it, I think a more gradual approach would be more effective. We need to first break down the taboo surrounding marijuana, and then people might be more inclined to use it responsibly.\n\nUnfortunately, people's perceptions of marijuana are often skewed due to its illegal status. However, it's essential to recognize that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine. By re-evaluating our perceptions of marijuana, we may be able to promote responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern world, and its strictness has decreased over time.  I recall attending church every Sunday as a child, dressing up in matching outfits and attending a traditional service. However, I've noticed that the church has become more casual, even during services that were once formal. For instance, the recent introduction of a 30-minute teen mass and the relaxed dress code, which includes jeans and casual wear, especially during summer when people attend in beach attire. This shift towards a more casual atmosphere has become more pronounced even in morning masses.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is more complex than just a matter of marital status or professional choices; it's a deeply ingrained trait that may be influenced by genetics. Research suggests that people with a predisposition to pedophilia are often born with it, and it's not solely the result of their upbringing or environment. I think it's unfair to assume that allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have addressed this issue, as the underlying issue lies in the individual's inherent traits.\n\nIf anything, the Catholic Church's handling of these situations is more concerning than the institution of marriage or female priests. If they knew about the incidents and chose to cover them up, that's a separate issue altogether. However, in many cases, it's likely that they were unaware of the extent of the problem. In any case, I don't think the church's rules on marriage and priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.",
            "The Iraq War still evokes a strong reaction from me. Initially, I was open to the idea, but the September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, and the invasion of Iraq was largely used as a pretext. The Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Osama Bin Laden were later proven false, which I found deeply disturbing. The war still bothers me, and I believe the Bush administration's deception of the American people on this issue is a serious issue that they have yet to acknowledge.\n\nEven Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. This, to me, constitutes a breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the constitution and its attempt to undermine it since September 11th is also concerning. I believe they were determined to go to war from the start.\n\nIt has been alleged that President Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and a desire to secure the country's energy supply. This was a covert motivation, which I find unacceptable. While I think it's time to end the war, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current plan to establish a coalition of surrounding countries to maintain order may not be effective in the long term, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and lead to more problems.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament is currently ineffective, and the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. Radical groups, including those led by Moqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, causing friction in the political process. This situation is complex and difficult to navigate.",
            "The speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq are somewhat unclear, as they seem uncertain and uninformed about the topic. At one point, they mention that the war appears pointless and was likely started as a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They suggest that the US presence in Iraq is primarily driven by a desire to establish a democracy and gain access to Iraq's oil resources. However, they argue that this goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the continued presence in Iraq is only causing more problems.\n\nThe speaker also expresses empathy for families with loved ones serving in Iraq and is torn about whether the war should end or continue. On one hand, they worry that staying in Iraq will lead to the destruction of the local culture and the growth of anti-American sentiment. On the other hand, they worry that leaving Iraq will allow the country to descend into chaos.\n\nThe speaker also brings up the example of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They suggest that President Bush's handling of the Iraq War may have similar consequences, and that it could damage his legacy.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the situation in Iraq is complex and will likely continue for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to establish laws governing the matters of religion, as it contradicts the principles of the separation of church and state, which is fundamental to the US constitution. This separation allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the country. \n\nBy attempting to make something illegal based on a particular church's views, the government would be overstepping its bounds and undermining the constitution. It would essentially be favoring one church's beliefs over another, which is not the government's role. In the US, most Catholics and Christians share similar views on this matter, but the government should not impose its will based on the opinions of a few individuals.\n\nThe concept of the separation of church and state is crucial to the country's foundation, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict religious freedom would be counterproductive and contradict the existing laws. Such an amendment would be a rare instance of government interference that restricts individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should intervene in this matter. The motivation behind pushing for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the society. The proposed amendment lacks a solid reason for its implementation and could potentially have unintended consequences, such as boosting the economy or improving society.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to make something illegal should rest with the churches, not the government. The government's role is to uphold the constitution and ensure that individual freedoms are protected, not to impose its will on people's personal choices and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War raises several concerns about the government's honesty with the American people regarding its motivations for invading the country. The US government seemed to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, creating a false narrative that blurred the lines between the two events. However, the government's actions were more about manipulating public emotions and justifying the war rather than providing a genuine reason.\n\nAs someone opposed to war, I strongly believe that a preemptive strike on Iraq was unwarranted. The war in Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from its past mistakes. The US government mistakenly believed that removing Saddam Hussein's regime would be a straightforward process, but they were unprepared for the consequences, including the loss of American lives and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government's handling of the war was particularly concerning, as they failed to plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. The attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq was a complex and long-term process, similar to the one the US underwent in its own history. The US government oversimplified the process, implying it would be a short and successful endeavor.\n\nIn reality, implementing democracy is a challenging and time-consuming process that often involves years of struggle and potential civil unrest. The US government's portrayal of the situation was overly optimistic, and they were not adequately prepared for the difficulties that followed. The war in Iraq has resulted in the loss of many American lives and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable government.\n\nOne of the key considerations in this situation is the moral obligation to see the war through to its conclusion, given the US's role in removing the Iraqi government and disrupting their way of life. However, this comes at a significant cost, including the risk of further American casualties. The US government's decision to invade Iraq was also motivated by a desire to control the country's oil resources, which raises questions about the true reasons behind the war.\n\nThe US government's decision-making process was also marred by a lack of thoroughness and transparency. The fact that they made claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false, and then failed to take action against countries like North Korea that were known to possess such weapons, further erodes trust in the government's decision-making abilities.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the Iraq War is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict when peace will be achieved. However, it is clear that the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to have a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind the war and the complexities of establishing a democratic government in a foreign country.",
            "I've always been in favor of gay marriage and believe it's a personal choice that should not be influenced by societal norms or government intervention. Recent studies have shown that sexual orientation may be determined biologically, rather than through environmental factors, which I think is a compelling argument against limiting rights based on something outside of an individual's control. I find it inhumane to deny people the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, politics and government should not have a role in determining personal relationships. Marriage is a personal matter that should be decided by the individuals involved, not by external authorities. I know of several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who are treated just like any other family, and I don't see why their relationships should be any different from those of heterosexual couples.\n\nI'm also aware of the scientific research suggesting that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical difference in the brain, rather than being the result of upbringing or environmental factors. This challenges the idea that people's sexual orientation is a choice, and I think it's essential to approach the issue with a more informed perspective.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, without the need for public scrutiny or government approval. It's ironic that a couple can get married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas without anyone being the wiser, but if two gay individuals want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle. I think this highlights the need to treat all marriages as private, personal affairs, rather than making them a matter of public interest.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes publicly accessible, and it's impossible to control who sees it. As a resident advisor, I've already dealt with this situation. Posting something online can shape people's perceptions of you, and sharing content about violent or sensitive topics can lead to serious consequences. If you post something like that, it might spread quickly, and authorities may take action. Even if you're just joking, it's hard to tell what others will consider serious or not.\n\nIn the case I'm referring to, a student overheard someone making a comment at school and reported it. When we looked into the matter, we found that the student had posted something on their social media that, in hindsight, seemed like a joke but became concerning given the situation. This highlights the issue of online privacy: once you post something online, it's no longer private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't dictate how others perceive or respond to your online content.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships. However, if a student brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy. If there's a potential threat, authorities must take it seriously. It's a different story if they're monitoring private conversations or messages. A better approach is for teachers to maintain professional boundaries online and not engage with students in ways that could lead to conflicts of interest or awkward situations.\n\nIn fact, it's best for teachers, like me, not to friend our residents or students online, as we don't want to inadvertently get drawn into their personal lives or be faced with difficult decisions that aren't our responsibility. It's essential to maintain a clear professional distance online to avoid these kinds of issues.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and I believe its initial purpose has been lost sight of. The intention was to restore democracy in another country, but I'm not convinced that's the primary motivation anymore. It's possible that the war is being prolonged simply to demonstrate our power and presence on the world stage, which I think is a questionable goal.\n\nThe original motive behind the war may have been to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, which would have been a just cause. However, if personal issues were involved, that would have undermined the legitimacy of the war. I think we made our point in the first few months, and the war's continuation for over a year or more is unwarranted.\n\nIf the goal was to overthrow a tyrannical ruler and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble reason for the war. Nevertheless, I believe our reasons for fighting have become distorted and misguided. It seems that we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, rather than achieving a decisive victory or bringing the conflict to a close.\n\nI think the war has gone on for far too long, and it's time for us to step back and allow the country to take care of itself. The billions of dollars spent on this war could be better spent addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. We have many pressing problems at home that require our attention and financial resources, and it's wasteful to continue spending on a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question regarding online safety. It seems that someone was able to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from occurring by accessing information online. This raises the issue of whether it's an invasion of privacy when someone posts personal information on social media platforms like Myspace. Since Myspace requires users to be friends with others to view their profiles, it implies that users have given permission to those individuals to see their information.\n\nIf someone posts content online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a large number of people. In this case, someone accessed the information and potentially saved a life. While it's not feasible for a single person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent such situations, it's also problematic to single out individuals for scrutiny. It's unclear how one would determine the intentions behind someone accessing a profile, whether it was a targeted search or a random discovery.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it's concerning that there are individuals who can access my information. A documentary I watched showed someone who demonstrated how easily he could gather information about a girl by accessing her online profile. He was able to obtain her screen name and engage in communication with her in a matter of minutes. I'm cautious about sharing personal details online, but I also want to maintain a social connection with friends through social media. It's a delicate balance between limiting what I share and keeping my online presence private.\n\nI've noticed that some people in my classes can identify me through my online profile, even if they don't know my screen name. They can infer information about my interests, appearance, and daily schedule. While I've attempted to limit my online presence, it's challenging to strike a balance between sharing information and maintaining privacy. I only accept people I know on social media, but it's impossible to know who else might be accessing my information.\n\nI recall hearing a story from my roommate about a high school that banned students from using Myspace. I'm unsure about the reasoning behind this decision, and I question whether it's within the school's authority to restrict students' online activities. I'm not convinced it's a clear-cut issue of privacy, but rather a matter of the school's power to regulate student behavior.\n\nThese thoughts are the only ones that come to mind in relation to this topic.",
            "It's difficult to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially when it comes to joining the chorus of those who claimed to have been against it from the start. However, the general consensus worldwide, aside from the US administration, was that the war was a bad idea. Recent polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population, including 80% of Iraqi citizens and 70% of US troops, believe the war was misguided.\n\nThe situation has been plagued by complications since the beginning, and it's challenging to find a straightforward solution. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are significant, and previous administrations have struggled to understand and adapt to these differences. The attempt to impose democracy on a region where it may not be welcomed can be problematic.\n\nWhile it's acknowledged that Saddam was a bad leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that might descend into chaos, as happened in Iraq. With no clear reason to stay in Iraq, it's puzzling why the US administration doesn't explore a more gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more. The fact that a significant majority of Iraqis, including those the US is trying to help, want the US out within a year raises questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy.\n\nIf the US were to ask the Iraqis for their opinion and they said they wanted the US to leave, it would shift the responsibility for any future outcomes. In this scenario, if things went awry, the US could argue that it was the Iraqi people who made the decision to leave, rather than the US. This could potentially improve the US's position in the region, even if it's unlikely to make them the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "While I believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States, I think it's essential to note that this issue transcends solely being a women's concern. It's also deeply intertwined with the specific field or industry one is working in. In general, women often face more significant obstacles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite equality being touted, women struggle to find recognition and promotion opportunities because of deeply ingrained societal attitudes. Historically, women have been underrepresented in senior business positions, leading some boards to overlook qualified female candidates for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women. Men, particularly those in non-traditional fields like fashion, also face prejudice. For instance, men who stay at home to care for their children often face societal disapproval, as traditional roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nSocietal attitudes towards gender roles are complex and vary depending on the industry or location. While progress has been made, change is a gradual process. I believe that promoting understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped can help alleviate some of these biases. It's essential to strike a balance between promoting change and avoiding resistance, which can occur if the pace is too rapid. Ultimately, we're making progress, and it's crucial to continue working towards a more inclusive society.\n\nInterestingly, discrimination can also occur within the same gender, depending on factors like upbringing, profession, or geographical location. For example, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional background may face prejudice from city-dwellers who view them as less sophisticated due to their grammar or mannerisms. This highlights the complexity of societal attitudes and the need for continued education and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making marijuana illegal, they chose to decriminalize it. This means it's no longer considered a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, similar to receiving a traffic ticket. This change removes the severe consequences often associated with a drug charge, such as arrest, imprisonment, and a permanent record that can hinder future opportunities. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term effects of a marijuana charge can still be a concern for individuals, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are financial benefits to decriminalizing marijuana. The costs of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for minor marijuana offenses can be substantial, and can divert funds away from more pressing community needs. In communities where resources are limited, decriminalization can be a practical solution to free up money for essential services like education, social programs, and aid for the homeless.\n\nDenver, with its more liberal attitude towards marijuana, is a prime example of a city that has benefited financially from decriminalization. The extra funds have allowed the city to invest in initiatives that improve the quality of life for its citizens. While some people may still be hesitant about the idea of widespread marijuana use, it's essential to consider the financial and social implications of a substance's legalization.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, it's difficult to generalize its effects on individuals, as people react differently to the substance. Some may be able to use it responsibly, while others may struggle with its impact on their lifestyle. Similarly, both marijuana and alcohol can have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I would say that yes, but. Many traditional practices in the Catholic Church remain unchanged over time, which is good for continuity. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they must attend church regularly and follow their doctrine strictly, which can sometimes lead to judging those who don't conform. Unfortunately, the Church often rejects individuals who don't perfectly follow their teachings or belong to other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents, one of whom was an Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This lack of tolerance is contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church's actions often contradict its principles, making it seem outdated. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's a good idea, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of pedophilia. People who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, as it involves exploiting a child, not an adult partner. Therefore, allowing priests to marry would not be a significant deterrent. \n\nIn general, I don't think permitting priests to be married would prevent child abuse, as such behavior is often driven by other factors. It's possible that it would continue to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and it's challenging to take a stance without offending someone. The conflict between separating church and state, combined with the difficulty in defining marriage, makes this topic particularly tricky. I'm not sure if marriage should be governed by the government or if it's a sacrament that should be left to individual beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, civil unions could be a feasible alternative to marriage, as they would provide equal rights without the label of marriage. It's essential to separate personal beliefs from state recognition, and the government shouldn't dictate the type of marriage. Two individuals in a committed relationship should have the same rights and benefits, regardless of whether they're married or in a civil union.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is a complex one, but it ultimately boils down to two people committing to each other in a civil union. If a logical consensus can be reached among the states, it would be more productive to push for federal legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. A constitutional amendment should be reserved for significant, far-reaching issues that affect the entire nation, and this topic doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nIn essence, it's not essential to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage; it's a matter of providing equal rights and benefits to all citizens, regardless of their marital status or orientation.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, but my exposure to gay friends has created a nuanced perspective. While I don't fully agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a federal issue, but rather something that should be decided at the state level. This approach respects the diverse opinions across different regions, such as Democratic and Republican states. Individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local laws and decisions, even if they differ from their personal views. My position is that homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals, and this should be determined by each state's discretion. I also disagree with a national ban on gay marriage and believe it should be up to individual states to decide their own policies. A president, such as Bush, shouldn't impose their views on the entire country, as they don't live in every state and their decisions won't last forever. Ultimately, state governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that affect their residents, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker begins by downplaying the significance of their initial hesitation to weigh in on the issue, but eventually shares their thoughts on the matter. They view Myspace, a public platform, as a place where users post content intended for the public to see. The speaker acknowledges that posting on the internet comes with the understanding that it will be accessible to anyone, including school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, the speaker believes that school officials have the right to monitor student activity, even if it's not directly related to the school's official name. They feel that officials could still access the content through students' homes. The speaker also suggests that school officials may use social media to identify students engaging in prohibited behavior, such as underage drinking or smoking.\n\nHowever, the speaker has reservations about schools monitoring students' online activity solely for the purpose of getting them in trouble. They consider this an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, they believe that monitoring can be justified if it's done to prevent harm or make the school a safer environment.\n\nThe speaker shares a personal anecdote about a teacher discussing the importance of ensuring student safety, including conducting lockdown drills and drills in response to potential terrorist threats. They draw a connection between these drills and the school's efforts to prevent a school shooting. The speaker concludes that the school officials in this case were acting to prevent a tragedy, much like the ones that have occurred at schools like Columbine.\n\nUltimately, the speaker reiterates that they don't think monitoring is an invasion of privacy if it's done to prevent harm or improve school safety.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of going to war after 9/11 because I had a personal connection to the event. However, upon further reflection, I believe we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into the conflict without a solid plan. This decision seemed to be driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a thoughtful approach. As a result, we may have inadvertently made matters worse.\n\nI now strongly oppose the war, and I think it was a misguided endeavor. I believe that as long as the local parties are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't have expected to impose our will on them and expect them to cooperate. Unfortunately, our involvement in their conflict has led me to become desensitized to the situation, and I struggle to see them as fellow human beings.\n\nThe nature of war in their culture is vastly different from ours, and I don't think they were motivated by a desire to improve their country, but rather to expel us. I think it would have been wiser for us to leave them to their own devices, rather than attempting to impose our will. Our objectives were unclear, and we were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a rational consideration of the consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq may have been understandable given the circumstances, but I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan for the occupation.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we were more focused on exacting revenge than on creating a lasting solution. I don't believe we were equipped to handle the complexity of their culture and the local dynamics. We lacked unity and a clear understanding of our objectives, which ultimately hindered our progress. I don't think we can change the people of the region; they are who they are, and we should accept that.\n\nIn my opinion, we're not making enough progress in the region, and our continued presence is more detrimental to ourselves than to the locals. I fear that even if we stay for a long time, the moment we leave, the situation will collapse, and we'll be no better off. I believe it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties resolve their issues without our interference."
