            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may benefit from adapting its views to be more accepting and open-minded on various issues. One reason for its declining following could be its unwavering stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated. By embracing a more modern perspective, the Church might be able to prevent its followers from drifting away. \n\nMany people are becoming disenchanted with the Church's stance on these issues, leading to a growing divide between the Church's views and those of its followers. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable adhering to a doctrine that vehemently opposes these rights. Similarly, the Church's stance on female priests and married priests can also be a point of contention.\n\nIt's worth noting that allowing married priests or female priests might not necessarily have prevented historical events, such as those related to child abuse. However, it's difficult to say with certainty what the outcome would have been. \n\nA more progressive stance on these issues might make the Church more appealing to those who value inclusivity and acceptance. The idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but people in other professions have both their work and personal lives. It's reasonable to expect the same from priests, who are human beings with their own needs and relationships.",
            "I'm neutral towards gay marriage, but I do believe that people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose. It's not something that I think is a conscious decision, but rather a natural aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I don't think individuals should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It wouldn't be right to deny two people of the same sex the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation, whereas a heterosexual couple would have that right.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not a matter of choice, but rather a natural aspect of a person's nature. Just as some people are born straight, others are born gay, and it's not something that they can change. So, it wouldn't be fair to hold them accountable for something that they can't control.\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because this is a personal issue and not a matter of national security or morality. The government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives, especially when it comes to their relationships and identities. Gay people are who they are, and it's not their fault. They shouldn't be penalized for being themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a matter of personal freedom, and people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without the government imposing its will on them.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there is no valid justification for denying it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this argument is flawed. The idea that gay relationships are inherently different from heterosexual ones is a misconception. Ultimately, it's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they share many similarities.\n\nMoreover, gay couples are entitled to the same civil rights as everyone else, including property rights, healthcare, and the right to visit their partners in the hospital. Denying these rights is arbitrary and illogical, especially when scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe issue is not about gay couples wanting to get married in a church, but about being recognized as a legally binding union by the government. If we separate church and state, this issue shouldn't be a problem. However, if we allow civil unions, why not extend the same rights to marriage?\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" argument is no longer valid, as it's a form of segregation. Gay couples face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about their children adjusting to society.\n\nOne of the main concerns is how children of gay couples will be treated by their peers and society. However, this can be mitigated by educating people about the realities of gay families and promoting acceptance. In fact, cities like New York have already implemented measures to support children of gay parents.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal in all states. The idea that a single amendment can dictate moral values is misguided, as morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its own moral standards on the country without considering the diverse perspectives of its citizens.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage based on flawed assumptions about the psychological nature of homosexuality. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these theories, and it's essential to rely on scientific evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it lacks any benefits. However, I disagree with this notion. While I don't support making illicit substances available to the general public, I do think they can be beneficial for medicinal purposes. This is evident from the fact that many controlled substances, such as oxycodone and vicodin, are used in pharmacies due to their medicinal value, even though they are also restricted. Therefore, if we dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana simply because it's prohibited, it's illogical. I believe we should acknowledge and accept its medicinal properties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that marijuana is not similar to alcohol in the sense that it's only harmful when abused. While excessive consumption of both substances can lead to negative consequences, we shouldn't associate marijuana with the same level of danger. Rather than abruptly legalizing it, I think a more gradual approach would be more effective. We need to first break down the taboo surrounding marijuana, and then people might be more inclined to use it responsibly.\n\nUnfortunately, people's perceptions of marijuana are often skewed due to its illegal status. However, it's essential to recognize that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine. By re-evaluating our perceptions of marijuana, we may be able to promote responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern world, and its strictness has decreased over time.  I recall attending church every Sunday as a child, dressing up in matching outfits and attending a traditional service. However, I've noticed that the church has become more casual, even during services that were once formal. For instance, the recent introduction of a 30-minute teen mass and the relaxed dress code, which includes jeans and casual wear, especially during summer when people attend in beach attire. This shift towards a more casual atmosphere has become more pronounced even in morning masses.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is more complex than just a matter of marital status or professional choices; it's a deeply ingrained trait that may be influenced by genetics. Research suggests that people with a predisposition to pedophilia are often born with it, and it's not solely the result of their upbringing or environment. I think it's unfair to assume that allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have addressed this issue, as the underlying issue lies in the individual's inherent traits.\n\nIf anything, the Catholic Church's handling of these situations is more concerning than the institution of marriage or female priests. If they knew about the incidents and chose to cover them up, that's a separate issue altogether. However, in many cases, it's likely that they were unaware of the extent of the problem. In any case, I don't think the church's rules on marriage and priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.",
            "The Iraq War still evokes a strong reaction from me. Initially, I was open to the idea, but the September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, and the invasion of Iraq was largely used as a pretext. The Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Osama Bin Laden were later proven false, which I found deeply disturbing. The war still bothers me, and I believe the Bush administration's deception of the American people on this issue is a serious issue that they have yet to acknowledge.\n\nEven Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. This, to me, constitutes a breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the constitution and its attempt to undermine it since September 11th is also concerning. I believe they were determined to go to war from the start.\n\nIt has been alleged that President Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and a desire to secure the country's energy supply. This was a covert motivation, which I find unacceptable. While I think it's time to end the war, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current plan to establish a coalition of surrounding countries to maintain order may not be effective in the long term, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and lead to more problems.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament is currently ineffective, and the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. Radical groups, including those led by Moqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, causing friction in the political process. This situation is complex and difficult to navigate.",
            "The speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq are somewhat unclear, as they seem uncertain and uninformed about the topic. At one point, they mention that the war appears pointless and was likely started as a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They suggest that the US presence in Iraq is primarily driven by a desire to establish a democracy and gain access to Iraq's oil resources. However, they argue that this goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the continued presence in Iraq is only causing more problems.\n\nThe speaker also expresses empathy for families with loved ones serving in Iraq and is torn about whether the war should end or continue. On one hand, they worry that staying in Iraq will lead to the destruction of the local culture and the growth of anti-American sentiment. On the other hand, they worry that leaving Iraq will allow the country to descend into chaos.\n\nThe speaker also brings up the example of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They suggest that President Bush's handling of the Iraq War may have similar consequences, and that it could damage his legacy.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the situation in Iraq is complex and will likely continue for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to establish laws governing the matters of religion, as it contradicts the principles of the separation of church and state, which is fundamental to the US constitution. This separation allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the country. \n\nBy attempting to make something illegal based on a particular church's views, the government would be overstepping its bounds and undermining the constitution. It would essentially be favoring one church's beliefs over another, which is not the government's role. In the US, most Catholics and Christians share similar views on this matter, but the government should not impose its will based on the opinions of a few individuals.\n\nThe concept of the separation of church and state is crucial to the country's foundation, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict religious freedom would be counterproductive and contradict the existing laws. Such an amendment would be a rare instance of government interference that restricts individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should intervene in this matter. The motivation behind pushing for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the society. The proposed amendment lacks a solid reason for its implementation and could potentially have unintended consequences, such as boosting the economy or improving society.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to make something illegal should rest with the churches, not the government. The government's role is to uphold the constitution and ensure that individual freedoms are protected, not to impose its will on people's personal choices and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War raises several concerns about the government's honesty with the American people regarding its motivations for invading the country. The US government seemed to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, creating a false narrative that blurred the lines between the two events. However, the government's actions were more about manipulating public emotions and justifying the war rather than providing a genuine reason.\n\nAs someone opposed to war, I strongly believe that a preemptive strike on Iraq was unwarranted. The war in Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from its past mistakes. The US government mistakenly believed that removing Saddam Hussein's regime would be a straightforward process, but they were unprepared for the consequences, including the loss of American lives and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government's handling of the war was particularly concerning, as they failed to plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. The attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq was a complex and long-term process, similar to the one the US underwent in its own history. The US government oversimplified the process, implying it would be a short and successful endeavor.\n\nIn reality, implementing democracy is a challenging and time-consuming process that often involves years of struggle and potential civil unrest. The US government's portrayal of the situation was overly optimistic, and they were not adequately prepared for the difficulties that followed. The war in Iraq has resulted in the loss of many American lives and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable government.\n\nOne of the key considerations in this situation is the moral obligation to see the war through to its conclusion, given the US's role in removing the Iraqi government and disrupting their way of life. However, this comes at a significant cost, including the risk of further American casualties. The US government's decision to invade Iraq was also motivated by a desire to control the country's oil resources, which raises questions about the true reasons behind the war.\n\nThe US government's decision-making process was also marred by a lack of thoroughness and transparency. The fact that they made claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false, and then failed to take action against countries like North Korea that were known to possess such weapons, further erodes trust in the government's decision-making abilities.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the Iraq War is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict when peace will be achieved. However, it is clear that the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to have a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind the war and the complexities of establishing a democratic government in a foreign country.",
            "I've always been in favor of gay marriage and believe it's a personal choice that should not be influenced by societal norms or government intervention. Recent studies have shown that sexual orientation may be determined biologically, rather than through environmental factors, which I think is a compelling argument against limiting rights based on something outside of an individual's control. I find it inhumane to deny people the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, politics and government should not have a role in determining personal relationships. Marriage is a personal matter that should be decided by the individuals involved, not by external authorities. I know of several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who are treated just like any other family, and I don't see why their relationships should be any different from those of heterosexual couples.\n\nI'm also aware of the scientific research suggesting that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical difference in the brain, rather than being the result of upbringing or environmental factors. This challenges the idea that people's sexual orientation is a choice, and I think it's essential to approach the issue with a more informed perspective.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, without the need for public scrutiny or government approval. It's ironic that a couple can get married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas without anyone being the wiser, but if two gay individuals want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle. I think this highlights the need to treat all marriages as private, personal affairs, rather than making them a matter of public interest.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes publicly accessible, and it's impossible to control who sees it. As a resident advisor, I've already dealt with this situation. Posting something online can shape people's perceptions of you, and sharing content about violent or sensitive topics can lead to serious consequences. If you post something like that, it might spread quickly, and authorities may take action. Even if you're just joking, it's hard to tell what others will consider serious or not.\n\nIn the case I'm referring to, a student overheard someone making a comment at school and reported it. When we looked into the matter, we found that the student had posted something on their social media that, in hindsight, seemed like a joke but became concerning given the situation. This highlights the issue of online privacy: once you post something online, it's no longer private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't dictate how others perceive or respond to your online content.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships. However, if a student brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy. If there's a potential threat, authorities must take it seriously. It's a different story if they're monitoring private conversations or messages. A better approach is for teachers to maintain professional boundaries online and not engage with students in ways that could lead to conflicts of interest or awkward situations.\n\nIn fact, it's best for teachers, like me, not to friend our residents or students online, as we don't want to inadvertently get drawn into their personal lives or be faced with difficult decisions that aren't our responsibility. It's essential to maintain a clear professional distance online to avoid these kinds of issues.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and I believe its initial purpose has been lost sight of. The intention was to restore democracy in another country, but I'm not convinced that's the primary motivation anymore. It's possible that the war is being prolonged simply to demonstrate our power and presence on the world stage, which I think is a questionable goal.\n\nThe original motive behind the war may have been to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, which would have been a just cause. However, if personal issues were involved, that would have undermined the legitimacy of the war. I think we made our point in the first few months, and the war's continuation for over a year or more is unwarranted.\n\nIf the goal was to overthrow a tyrannical ruler and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble reason for the war. Nevertheless, I believe our reasons for fighting have become distorted and misguided. It seems that we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, rather than achieving a decisive victory or bringing the conflict to a close.\n\nI think the war has gone on for far too long, and it's time for us to step back and allow the country to take care of itself. The billions of dollars spent on this war could be better spent addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. We have many pressing problems at home that require our attention and financial resources, and it's wasteful to continue spending on a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question regarding online safety. It seems that someone was able to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from occurring by accessing information online. This raises the issue of whether it's an invasion of privacy when someone posts personal information on social media platforms like Myspace. Since Myspace requires users to be friends with others to view their profiles, it implies that users have given permission to those individuals to see their information.\n\nIf someone posts content online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a large number of people. In this case, someone accessed the information and potentially saved a life. While it's not feasible for a single person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent such situations, it's also problematic to single out individuals for scrutiny. It's unclear how one would determine the intentions behind someone accessing a profile, whether it was a targeted search or a random discovery.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it's concerning that there are individuals who can access my information. A documentary I watched showed someone who demonstrated how easily he could gather information about a girl by accessing her online profile. He was able to obtain her screen name and engage in communication with her in a matter of minutes. I'm cautious about sharing personal details online, but I also want to maintain a social connection with friends through social media. It's a delicate balance between limiting what I share and keeping my online presence private.\n\nI've noticed that some people in my classes can identify me through my online profile, even if they don't know my screen name. They can infer information about my interests, appearance, and daily schedule. While I've attempted to limit my online presence, it's challenging to strike a balance between sharing information and maintaining privacy. I only accept people I know on social media, but it's impossible to know who else might be accessing my information.\n\nI recall hearing a story from my roommate about a high school that banned students from using Myspace. I'm unsure about the reasoning behind this decision, and I question whether it's within the school's authority to restrict students' online activities. I'm not convinced it's a clear-cut issue of privacy, but rather a matter of the school's power to regulate student behavior.\n\nThese thoughts are the only ones that come to mind in relation to this topic.",
            "It's difficult to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially when it comes to joining the chorus of those who claimed to have been against it from the start. However, the general consensus worldwide, aside from the US administration, was that the war was a bad idea. Recent polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population, including 80% of Iraqi citizens and 70% of US troops, believe the war was misguided.\n\nThe situation has been plagued by complications since the beginning, and it's challenging to find a straightforward solution. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are significant, and previous administrations have struggled to understand and adapt to these differences. The attempt to impose democracy on a region where it may not be welcomed can be problematic.\n\nWhile it's acknowledged that Saddam was a bad leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that might descend into chaos, as happened in Iraq. With no clear reason to stay in Iraq, it's puzzling why the US administration doesn't explore a more gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more. The fact that a significant majority of Iraqis, including those the US is trying to help, want the US out within a year raises questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy.\n\nIf the US were to ask the Iraqis for their opinion and they said they wanted the US to leave, it would shift the responsibility for any future outcomes. In this scenario, if things went awry, the US could argue that it was the Iraqi people who made the decision to leave, rather than the US. This could potentially improve the US's position in the region, even if it's unlikely to make them the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "While I believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States, I think it's essential to note that this issue transcends solely being a women's concern. It's also deeply intertwined with the specific field or industry one is working in. In general, women often face more significant obstacles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite equality being touted, women struggle to find recognition and promotion opportunities because of deeply ingrained societal attitudes. Historically, women have been underrepresented in senior business positions, leading some boards to overlook qualified female candidates for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women. Men, particularly those in non-traditional fields like fashion, also face prejudice. For instance, men who stay at home to care for their children often face societal disapproval, as traditional roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nSocietal attitudes towards gender roles are complex and vary depending on the industry or location. While progress has been made, change is a gradual process. I believe that promoting understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped can help alleviate some of these biases. It's essential to strike a balance between promoting change and avoiding resistance, which can occur if the pace is too rapid. Ultimately, we're making progress, and it's crucial to continue working towards a more inclusive society.\n\nInterestingly, discrimination can also occur within the same gender, depending on factors like upbringing, profession, or geographical location. For example, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional background may face prejudice from city-dwellers who view them as less sophisticated due to their grammar or mannerisms. This highlights the complexity of societal attitudes and the need for continued education and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making marijuana illegal, they chose to decriminalize it. This means it's no longer considered a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, similar to receiving a traffic ticket. This change removes the severe consequences often associated with a drug charge, such as arrest, imprisonment, and a permanent record that can hinder future opportunities. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term effects of a marijuana charge can still be a concern for individuals, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are financial benefits to decriminalizing marijuana. The costs of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for minor marijuana offenses can be substantial, and can divert funds away from more pressing community needs. In communities where resources are limited, decriminalization can be a practical solution to free up money for essential services like education, social programs, and aid for the homeless.\n\nDenver, with its more liberal attitude towards marijuana, is a prime example of a city that has benefited financially from decriminalization. The extra funds have allowed the city to invest in initiatives that improve the quality of life for its citizens. While some people may still be hesitant about the idea of widespread marijuana use, it's essential to consider the financial and social implications of a substance's legalization.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, it's difficult to generalize its effects on individuals, as people react differently to the substance. Some may be able to use it responsibly, while others may struggle with its impact on their lifestyle. Similarly, both marijuana and alcohol can have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I would say that yes, but. Many traditional practices in the Catholic Church remain unchanged over time, which is good for continuity. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they must attend church regularly and follow their doctrine strictly, which can sometimes lead to judging those who don't conform. Unfortunately, the Church often rejects individuals who don't perfectly follow their teachings or belong to other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents, one of whom was an Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This lack of tolerance is contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church's actions often contradict its principles, making it seem outdated. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's a good idea, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of pedophilia. People who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, as it involves exploiting a child, not an adult partner. Therefore, allowing priests to marry would not be a significant deterrent. \n\nIn general, I don't think permitting priests to be married would prevent child abuse, as such behavior is often driven by other factors. It's possible that it would continue to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and it's challenging to take a stance without offending someone. The conflict between separating church and state, combined with the difficulty in defining marriage, makes this topic particularly tricky. I'm not sure if marriage should be governed by the government or if it's a sacrament that should be left to individual beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, civil unions could be a feasible alternative to marriage, as they would provide equal rights without the label of marriage. It's essential to separate personal beliefs from state recognition, and the government shouldn't dictate the type of marriage. Two individuals in a committed relationship should have the same rights and benefits, regardless of whether they're married or in a civil union.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is a complex one, but it ultimately boils down to two people committing to each other in a civil union. If a logical consensus can be reached among the states, it would be more productive to push for federal legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. A constitutional amendment should be reserved for significant, far-reaching issues that affect the entire nation, and this topic doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nIn essence, it's not essential to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage; it's a matter of providing equal rights and benefits to all citizens, regardless of their marital status or orientation.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, but my exposure to gay friends has created a nuanced perspective. While I don't fully agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a federal issue, but rather something that should be decided at the state level. This approach respects the diverse opinions across different regions, such as Democratic and Republican states. Individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local laws and decisions, even if they differ from their personal views. My position is that homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals, and this should be determined by each state's discretion. I also disagree with a national ban on gay marriage and believe it should be up to individual states to decide their own policies. A president, such as Bush, shouldn't impose their views on the entire country, as they don't live in every state and their decisions won't last forever. Ultimately, state governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that affect their residents, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker begins by downplaying the significance of their initial hesitation to weigh in on the issue, but eventually shares their thoughts on the matter. They view Myspace, a public platform, as a place where users post content intended for the public to see. The speaker acknowledges that posting on the internet comes with the understanding that it will be accessible to anyone, including school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, the speaker believes that school officials have the right to monitor student activity, even if it's not directly related to the school's official name. They feel that officials could still access the content through students' homes. The speaker also suggests that school officials may use social media to identify students engaging in prohibited behavior, such as underage drinking or smoking.\n\nHowever, the speaker has reservations about schools monitoring students' online activity solely for the purpose of getting them in trouble. They consider this an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, they believe that monitoring can be justified if it's done to prevent harm or make the school a safer environment.\n\nThe speaker shares a personal anecdote about a teacher discussing the importance of ensuring student safety, including conducting lockdown drills and drills in response to potential terrorist threats. They draw a connection between these drills and the school's efforts to prevent a school shooting. The speaker concludes that the school officials in this case were acting to prevent a tragedy, much like the ones that have occurred at schools like Columbine.\n\nUltimately, the speaker reiterates that they don't think monitoring is an invasion of privacy if it's done to prevent harm or improve school safety.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of going to war after 9/11 because I had a personal connection to the event. However, upon further reflection, I believe we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into the conflict without a solid plan. This decision seemed to be driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a thoughtful approach. As a result, we may have inadvertently made matters worse.\n\nI now strongly oppose the war, and I think it was a misguided endeavor. I believe that as long as the local parties are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't have expected to impose our will on them and expect them to cooperate. Unfortunately, our involvement in their conflict has led me to become desensitized to the situation, and I struggle to see them as fellow human beings.\n\nThe nature of war in their culture is vastly different from ours, and I don't think they were motivated by a desire to improve their country, but rather to expel us. I think it would have been wiser for us to leave them to their own devices, rather than attempting to impose our will. Our objectives were unclear, and we were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a rational consideration of the consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq may have been understandable given the circumstances, but I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan for the occupation.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we were more focused on exacting revenge than on creating a lasting solution. I don't believe we were equipped to handle the complexity of their culture and the local dynamics. We lacked unity and a clear understanding of our objectives, which ultimately hindered our progress. I don't think we can change the people of the region; they are who they are, and we should accept that.\n\nIn my opinion, we're not making enough progress in the region, and our continued presence is more detrimental to ourselves than to the locals. I fear that even if we stay for a long time, the moment we leave, the situation will collapse, and we'll be no better off. I believe it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties resolve their issues without our interference."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may benefit from adapting its views to be more accepting and open-minded on various issues. One reason for its declining following could be its unwavering stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated. By embracing a more modern perspective, the Church might be able to prevent its followers from drifting away. \n\nMany people are becoming disenchanted with the Church's stance on these issues, leading to a growing divide between the Church's views and those of its followers. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable adhering to a doctrine that vehemently opposes these rights. Similarly, the Church's stance on female priests and married priests can also be a point of contention.\n\nIt's worth noting that allowing married priests or female priests might not necessarily have prevented historical events, such as those related to child abuse. However, it's difficult to say with certainty what the outcome would have been. \n\nA more progressive stance on these issues might make the Church more appealing to those who value inclusivity and acceptance. The idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but people in other professions have both their work and personal lives. It's reasonable to expect the same from priests, who are human beings with their own needs and relationships.",
            "I'm neutral towards gay marriage, but I do believe that people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose. It's not something that I think is a conscious decision, but rather a natural aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I don't think individuals should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It wouldn't be right to deny two people of the same sex the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation, whereas a heterosexual couple would have that right.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not a matter of choice, but rather a natural aspect of a person's nature. Just as some people are born straight, others are born gay, and it's not something that they can change. So, it wouldn't be fair to hold them accountable for something that they can't control.\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because this is a personal issue and not a matter of national security or morality. The government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives, especially when it comes to their relationships and identities. Gay people are who they are, and it's not their fault. They shouldn't be penalized for being themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a matter of personal freedom, and people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without the government imposing its will on them.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there is no valid justification for denying it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this argument is flawed. The idea that gay relationships are inherently different from heterosexual ones is a misconception. Ultimately, it's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they share many similarities.\n\nMoreover, gay couples are entitled to the same civil rights as everyone else, including property rights, healthcare, and the right to visit their partners in the hospital. Denying these rights is arbitrary and illogical, especially when scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe issue is not about gay couples wanting to get married in a church, but about being recognized as a legally binding union by the government. If we separate church and state, this issue shouldn't be a problem. However, if we allow civil unions, why not extend the same rights to marriage?\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" argument is no longer valid, as it's a form of segregation. Gay couples face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about their children adjusting to society.\n\nOne of the main concerns is how children of gay couples will be treated by their peers and society. However, this can be mitigated by educating people about the realities of gay families and promoting acceptance. In fact, cities like New York have already implemented measures to support children of gay parents.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal in all states. The idea that a single amendment can dictate moral values is misguided, as morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its own moral standards on the country without considering the diverse perspectives of its citizens.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage based on flawed assumptions about the psychological nature of homosexuality. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these theories, and it's essential to rely on scientific evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it lacks any benefits. However, I disagree with this notion. While I don't support making illicit substances available to the general public, I do think they can be beneficial for medicinal purposes. This is evident from the fact that many controlled substances, such as oxycodone and vicodin, are used in pharmacies due to their medicinal value, even though they are also restricted. Therefore, if we dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana simply because it's prohibited, it's illogical. I believe we should acknowledge and accept its medicinal properties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that marijuana is not similar to alcohol in the sense that it's only harmful when abused. While excessive consumption of both substances can lead to negative consequences, we shouldn't associate marijuana with the same level of danger. Rather than abruptly legalizing it, I think a more gradual approach would be more effective. We need to first break down the taboo surrounding marijuana, and then people might be more inclined to use it responsibly.\n\nUnfortunately, people's perceptions of marijuana are often skewed due to its illegal status. However, it's essential to recognize that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine. By re-evaluating our perceptions of marijuana, we may be able to promote responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern world, and its strictness has decreased over time.  I recall attending church every Sunday as a child, dressing up in matching outfits and attending a traditional service. However, I've noticed that the church has become more casual, even during services that were once formal. For instance, the recent introduction of a 30-minute teen mass and the relaxed dress code, which includes jeans and casual wear, especially during summer when people attend in beach attire. This shift towards a more casual atmosphere has become more pronounced even in morning masses.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is more complex than just a matter of marital status or professional choices; it's a deeply ingrained trait that may be influenced by genetics. Research suggests that people with a predisposition to pedophilia are often born with it, and it's not solely the result of their upbringing or environment. I think it's unfair to assume that allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have addressed this issue, as the underlying issue lies in the individual's inherent traits.\n\nIf anything, the Catholic Church's handling of these situations is more concerning than the institution of marriage or female priests. If they knew about the incidents and chose to cover them up, that's a separate issue altogether. However, in many cases, it's likely that they were unaware of the extent of the problem. In any case, I don't think the church's rules on marriage and priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.",
            "The Iraq War still evokes a strong reaction from me. Initially, I was open to the idea, but the September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, and the invasion of Iraq was largely used as a pretext. The Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Osama Bin Laden were later proven false, which I found deeply disturbing. The war still bothers me, and I believe the Bush administration's deception of the American people on this issue is a serious issue that they have yet to acknowledge.\n\nEven Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. This, to me, constitutes a breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the constitution and its attempt to undermine it since September 11th is also concerning. I believe they were determined to go to war from the start.\n\nIt has been alleged that President Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and a desire to secure the country's energy supply. This was a covert motivation, which I find unacceptable. While I think it's time to end the war, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current plan to establish a coalition of surrounding countries to maintain order may not be effective in the long term, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and lead to more problems.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament is currently ineffective, and the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. Radical groups, including those led by Moqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, causing friction in the political process. This situation is complex and difficult to navigate.",
            "The speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq are somewhat unclear, as they seem uncertain and uninformed about the topic. At one point, they mention that the war appears pointless and was likely started as a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They suggest that the US presence in Iraq is primarily driven by a desire to establish a democracy and gain access to Iraq's oil resources. However, they argue that this goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the continued presence in Iraq is only causing more problems.\n\nThe speaker also expresses empathy for families with loved ones serving in Iraq and is torn about whether the war should end or continue. On one hand, they worry that staying in Iraq will lead to the destruction of the local culture and the growth of anti-American sentiment. On the other hand, they worry that leaving Iraq will allow the country to descend into chaos.\n\nThe speaker also brings up the example of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They suggest that President Bush's handling of the Iraq War may have similar consequences, and that it could damage his legacy.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the situation in Iraq is complex and will likely continue for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to establish laws governing the matters of religion, as it contradicts the principles of the separation of church and state, which is fundamental to the US constitution. This separation allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the country. \n\nBy attempting to make something illegal based on a particular church's views, the government would be overstepping its bounds and undermining the constitution. It would essentially be favoring one church's beliefs over another, which is not the government's role. In the US, most Catholics and Christians share similar views on this matter, but the government should not impose its will based on the opinions of a few individuals.\n\nThe concept of the separation of church and state is crucial to the country's foundation, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict religious freedom would be counterproductive and contradict the existing laws. Such an amendment would be a rare instance of government interference that restricts individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should intervene in this matter. The motivation behind pushing for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the society. The proposed amendment lacks a solid reason for its implementation and could potentially have unintended consequences, such as boosting the economy or improving society.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to make something illegal should rest with the churches, not the government. The government's role is to uphold the constitution and ensure that individual freedoms are protected, not to impose its will on people's personal choices and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War raises several concerns about the government's honesty with the American people regarding its motivations for invading the country. The US government seemed to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, creating a false narrative that blurred the lines between the two events. However, the government's actions were more about manipulating public emotions and justifying the war rather than providing a genuine reason.\n\nAs someone opposed to war, I strongly believe that a preemptive strike on Iraq was unwarranted. The war in Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from its past mistakes. The US government mistakenly believed that removing Saddam Hussein's regime would be a straightforward process, but they were unprepared for the consequences, including the loss of American lives and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government's handling of the war was particularly concerning, as they failed to plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. The attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq was a complex and long-term process, similar to the one the US underwent in its own history. The US government oversimplified the process, implying it would be a short and successful endeavor.\n\nIn reality, implementing democracy is a challenging and time-consuming process that often involves years of struggle and potential civil unrest. The US government's portrayal of the situation was overly optimistic, and they were not adequately prepared for the difficulties that followed. The war in Iraq has resulted in the loss of many American lives and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable government.\n\nOne of the key considerations in this situation is the moral obligation to see the war through to its conclusion, given the US's role in removing the Iraqi government and disrupting their way of life. However, this comes at a significant cost, including the risk of further American casualties. The US government's decision to invade Iraq was also motivated by a desire to control the country's oil resources, which raises questions about the true reasons behind the war.\n\nThe US government's decision-making process was also marred by a lack of thoroughness and transparency. The fact that they made claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false, and then failed to take action against countries like North Korea that were known to possess such weapons, further erodes trust in the government's decision-making abilities.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the Iraq War is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict when peace will be achieved. However, it is clear that the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to have a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind the war and the complexities of establishing a democratic government in a foreign country.",
            "I've always been in favor of gay marriage and believe it's a personal choice that should not be influenced by societal norms or government intervention. Recent studies have shown that sexual orientation may be determined biologically, rather than through environmental factors, which I think is a compelling argument against limiting rights based on something outside of an individual's control. I find it inhumane to deny people the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, politics and government should not have a role in determining personal relationships. Marriage is a personal matter that should be decided by the individuals involved, not by external authorities. I know of several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who are treated just like any other family, and I don't see why their relationships should be any different from those of heterosexual couples.\n\nI'm also aware of the scientific research suggesting that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical difference in the brain, rather than being the result of upbringing or environmental factors. This challenges the idea that people's sexual orientation is a choice, and I think it's essential to approach the issue with a more informed perspective.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, without the need for public scrutiny or government approval. It's ironic that a couple can get married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas without anyone being the wiser, but if two gay individuals want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle. I think this highlights the need to treat all marriages as private, personal affairs, rather than making them a matter of public interest.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes publicly accessible, and it's impossible to control who sees it. As a resident advisor, I've already dealt with this situation. Posting something online can shape people's perceptions of you, and sharing content about violent or sensitive topics can lead to serious consequences. If you post something like that, it might spread quickly, and authorities may take action. Even if you're just joking, it's hard to tell what others will consider serious or not.\n\nIn the case I'm referring to, a student overheard someone making a comment at school and reported it. When we looked into the matter, we found that the student had posted something on their social media that, in hindsight, seemed like a joke but became concerning given the situation. This highlights the issue of online privacy: once you post something online, it's no longer private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't dictate how others perceive or respond to your online content.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships. However, if a student brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy. If there's a potential threat, authorities must take it seriously. It's a different story if they're monitoring private conversations or messages. A better approach is for teachers to maintain professional boundaries online and not engage with students in ways that could lead to conflicts of interest or awkward situations.\n\nIn fact, it's best for teachers, like me, not to friend our residents or students online, as we don't want to inadvertently get drawn into their personal lives or be faced with difficult decisions that aren't our responsibility. It's essential to maintain a clear professional distance online to avoid these kinds of issues.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and I believe its initial purpose has been lost sight of. The intention was to restore democracy in another country, but I'm not convinced that's the primary motivation anymore. It's possible that the war is being prolonged simply to demonstrate our power and presence on the world stage, which I think is a questionable goal.\n\nThe original motive behind the war may have been to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, which would have been a just cause. However, if personal issues were involved, that would have undermined the legitimacy of the war. I think we made our point in the first few months, and the war's continuation for over a year or more is unwarranted.\n\nIf the goal was to overthrow a tyrannical ruler and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble reason for the war. Nevertheless, I believe our reasons for fighting have become distorted and misguided. It seems that we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, rather than achieving a decisive victory or bringing the conflict to a close.\n\nI think the war has gone on for far too long, and it's time for us to step back and allow the country to take care of itself. The billions of dollars spent on this war could be better spent addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. We have many pressing problems at home that require our attention and financial resources, and it's wasteful to continue spending on a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question regarding online safety. It seems that someone was able to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from occurring by accessing information online. This raises the issue of whether it's an invasion of privacy when someone posts personal information on social media platforms like Myspace. Since Myspace requires users to be friends with others to view their profiles, it implies that users have given permission to those individuals to see their information.\n\nIf someone posts content online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a large number of people. In this case, someone accessed the information and potentially saved a life. While it's not feasible for a single person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent such situations, it's also problematic to single out individuals for scrutiny. It's unclear how one would determine the intentions behind someone accessing a profile, whether it was a targeted search or a random discovery.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it's concerning that there are individuals who can access my information. A documentary I watched showed someone who demonstrated how easily he could gather information about a girl by accessing her online profile. He was able to obtain her screen name and engage in communication with her in a matter of minutes. I'm cautious about sharing personal details online, but I also want to maintain a social connection with friends through social media. It's a delicate balance between limiting what I share and keeping my online presence private.\n\nI've noticed that some people in my classes can identify me through my online profile, even if they don't know my screen name. They can infer information about my interests, appearance, and daily schedule. While I've attempted to limit my online presence, it's challenging to strike a balance between sharing information and maintaining privacy. I only accept people I know on social media, but it's impossible to know who else might be accessing my information.\n\nI recall hearing a story from my roommate about a high school that banned students from using Myspace. I'm unsure about the reasoning behind this decision, and I question whether it's within the school's authority to restrict students' online activities. I'm not convinced it's a clear-cut issue of privacy, but rather a matter of the school's power to regulate student behavior.\n\nThese thoughts are the only ones that come to mind in relation to this topic.",
            "It's difficult to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially when it comes to joining the chorus of those who claimed to have been against it from the start. However, the general consensus worldwide, aside from the US administration, was that the war was a bad idea. Recent polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population, including 80% of Iraqi citizens and 70% of US troops, believe the war was misguided.\n\nThe situation has been plagued by complications since the beginning, and it's challenging to find a straightforward solution. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are significant, and previous administrations have struggled to understand and adapt to these differences. The attempt to impose democracy on a region where it may not be welcomed can be problematic.\n\nWhile it's acknowledged that Saddam was a bad leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that might descend into chaos, as happened in Iraq. With no clear reason to stay in Iraq, it's puzzling why the US administration doesn't explore a more gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more. The fact that a significant majority of Iraqis, including those the US is trying to help, want the US out within a year raises questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy.\n\nIf the US were to ask the Iraqis for their opinion and they said they wanted the US to leave, it would shift the responsibility for any future outcomes. In this scenario, if things went awry, the US could argue that it was the Iraqi people who made the decision to leave, rather than the US. This could potentially improve the US's position in the region, even if it's unlikely to make them the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "While I believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States, I think it's essential to note that this issue transcends solely being a women's concern. It's also deeply intertwined with the specific field or industry one is working in. In general, women often face more significant obstacles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite equality being touted, women struggle to find recognition and promotion opportunities because of deeply ingrained societal attitudes. Historically, women have been underrepresented in senior business positions, leading some boards to overlook qualified female candidates for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women. Men, particularly those in non-traditional fields like fashion, also face prejudice. For instance, men who stay at home to care for their children often face societal disapproval, as traditional roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nSocietal attitudes towards gender roles are complex and vary depending on the industry or location. While progress has been made, change is a gradual process. I believe that promoting understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped can help alleviate some of these biases. It's essential to strike a balance between promoting change and avoiding resistance, which can occur if the pace is too rapid. Ultimately, we're making progress, and it's crucial to continue working towards a more inclusive society.\n\nInterestingly, discrimination can also occur within the same gender, depending on factors like upbringing, profession, or geographical location. For example, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional background may face prejudice from city-dwellers who view them as less sophisticated due to their grammar or mannerisms. This highlights the complexity of societal attitudes and the need for continued education and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making marijuana illegal, they chose to decriminalize it. This means it's no longer considered a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, similar to receiving a traffic ticket. This change removes the severe consequences often associated with a drug charge, such as arrest, imprisonment, and a permanent record that can hinder future opportunities. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term effects of a marijuana charge can still be a concern for individuals, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are financial benefits to decriminalizing marijuana. The costs of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for minor marijuana offenses can be substantial, and can divert funds away from more pressing community needs. In communities where resources are limited, decriminalization can be a practical solution to free up money for essential services like education, social programs, and aid for the homeless.\n\nDenver, with its more liberal attitude towards marijuana, is a prime example of a city that has benefited financially from decriminalization. The extra funds have allowed the city to invest in initiatives that improve the quality of life for its citizens. While some people may still be hesitant about the idea of widespread marijuana use, it's essential to consider the financial and social implications of a substance's legalization.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, it's difficult to generalize its effects on individuals, as people react differently to the substance. Some may be able to use it responsibly, while others may struggle with its impact on their lifestyle. Similarly, both marijuana and alcohol can have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I would say that yes, but. Many traditional practices in the Catholic Church remain unchanged over time, which is good for continuity. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they must attend church regularly and follow their doctrine strictly, which can sometimes lead to judging those who don't conform. Unfortunately, the Church often rejects individuals who don't perfectly follow their teachings or belong to other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents, one of whom was an Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This lack of tolerance is contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church's actions often contradict its principles, making it seem outdated. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's a good idea, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of pedophilia. People who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, as it involves exploiting a child, not an adult partner. Therefore, allowing priests to marry would not be a significant deterrent. \n\nIn general, I don't think permitting priests to be married would prevent child abuse, as such behavior is often driven by other factors. It's possible that it would continue to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and it's challenging to take a stance without offending someone. The conflict between separating church and state, combined with the difficulty in defining marriage, makes this topic particularly tricky. I'm not sure if marriage should be governed by the government or if it's a sacrament that should be left to individual beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, civil unions could be a feasible alternative to marriage, as they would provide equal rights without the label of marriage. It's essential to separate personal beliefs from state recognition, and the government shouldn't dictate the type of marriage. Two individuals in a committed relationship should have the same rights and benefits, regardless of whether they're married or in a civil union.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is a complex one, but it ultimately boils down to two people committing to each other in a civil union. If a logical consensus can be reached among the states, it would be more productive to push for federal legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. A constitutional amendment should be reserved for significant, far-reaching issues that affect the entire nation, and this topic doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nIn essence, it's not essential to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage; it's a matter of providing equal rights and benefits to all citizens, regardless of their marital status or orientation.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, but my exposure to gay friends has created a nuanced perspective. While I don't fully agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a federal issue, but rather something that should be decided at the state level. This approach respects the diverse opinions across different regions, such as Democratic and Republican states. Individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local laws and decisions, even if they differ from their personal views. My position is that homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals, and this should be determined by each state's discretion. I also disagree with a national ban on gay marriage and believe it should be up to individual states to decide their own policies. A president, such as Bush, shouldn't impose their views on the entire country, as they don't live in every state and their decisions won't last forever. Ultimately, state governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that affect their residents, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker begins by downplaying the significance of their initial hesitation to weigh in on the issue, but eventually shares their thoughts on the matter. They view Myspace, a public platform, as a place where users post content intended for the public to see. The speaker acknowledges that posting on the internet comes with the understanding that it will be accessible to anyone, including school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, the speaker believes that school officials have the right to monitor student activity, even if it's not directly related to the school's official name. They feel that officials could still access the content through students' homes. The speaker also suggests that school officials may use social media to identify students engaging in prohibited behavior, such as underage drinking or smoking.\n\nHowever, the speaker has reservations about schools monitoring students' online activity solely for the purpose of getting them in trouble. They consider this an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, they believe that monitoring can be justified if it's done to prevent harm or make the school a safer environment.\n\nThe speaker shares a personal anecdote about a teacher discussing the importance of ensuring student safety, including conducting lockdown drills and drills in response to potential terrorist threats. They draw a connection between these drills and the school's efforts to prevent a school shooting. The speaker concludes that the school officials in this case were acting to prevent a tragedy, much like the ones that have occurred at schools like Columbine.\n\nUltimately, the speaker reiterates that they don't think monitoring is an invasion of privacy if it's done to prevent harm or improve school safety.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of going to war after 9/11 because I had a personal connection to the event. However, upon further reflection, I believe we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into the conflict without a solid plan. This decision seemed to be driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a thoughtful approach. As a result, we may have inadvertently made matters worse.\n\nI now strongly oppose the war, and I think it was a misguided endeavor. I believe that as long as the local parties are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't have expected to impose our will on them and expect them to cooperate. Unfortunately, our involvement in their conflict has led me to become desensitized to the situation, and I struggle to see them as fellow human beings.\n\nThe nature of war in their culture is vastly different from ours, and I don't think they were motivated by a desire to improve their country, but rather to expel us. I think it would have been wiser for us to leave them to their own devices, rather than attempting to impose our will. Our objectives were unclear, and we were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a rational consideration of the consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq may have been understandable given the circumstances, but I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan for the occupation.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we were more focused on exacting revenge than on creating a lasting solution. I don't believe we were equipped to handle the complexity of their culture and the local dynamics. We lacked unity and a clear understanding of our objectives, which ultimately hindered our progress. I don't think we can change the people of the region; they are who they are, and we should accept that.\n\nIn my opinion, we're not making enough progress in the region, and our continued presence is more detrimental to ourselves than to the locals. I fear that even if we stay for a long time, the moment we leave, the situation will collapse, and we'll be no better off. I believe it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties resolve their issues without our interference."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may benefit from adapting its views to be more accepting and open-minded on various issues. One reason for its declining following could be its unwavering stance on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated. By embracing a more modern perspective, the Church might be able to prevent its followers from drifting away. \n\nMany people are becoming disenchanted with the Church's stance on these issues, leading to a growing divide between the Church's views and those of its followers. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable adhering to a doctrine that vehemently opposes these rights. Similarly, the Church's stance on female priests and married priests can also be a point of contention.\n\nIt's worth noting that allowing married priests or female priests might not necessarily have prevented historical events, such as those related to child abuse. However, it's difficult to say with certainty what the outcome would have been. \n\nA more progressive stance on these issues might make the Church more appealing to those who value inclusivity and acceptance. The idea that priests are married to God and devoted to their faith is a valid one, but people in other professions have both their work and personal lives. It's reasonable to expect the same from priests, who are human beings with their own needs and relationships.",
            "I'm neutral towards gay marriage, but I do believe that people should have the freedom to love whoever they choose. It's not something that I think is a conscious decision, but rather a natural aspect of one's identity. Therefore, I don't think individuals should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It wouldn't be right to deny two people of the same sex the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation, whereas a heterosexual couple would have that right.\n\nIn my opinion, it's not a matter of choice, but rather a natural aspect of a person's nature. Just as some people are born straight, others are born gay, and it's not something that they can change. So, it wouldn't be fair to hold them accountable for something that they can't control.\n\nI think the government should stay out of it because this is a personal issue and not a matter of national security or morality. The government shouldn't interfere with people's personal lives, especially when it comes to their relationships and identities. Gay people are who they are, and it's not their fault. They shouldn't be penalized for being themselves.\n\nUltimately, this is a matter of personal freedom, and people should be allowed to live their lives as they see fit, without the government imposing its will on them.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized. The main reason for this is that there is no valid justification for denying it. Some people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this argument is flawed. The idea that gay relationships are inherently different from heterosexual ones is a misconception. Ultimately, it's like comparing two sides of the same coin - they share many similarities.\n\nMoreover, gay couples are entitled to the same civil rights as everyone else, including property rights, healthcare, and the right to visit their partners in the hospital. Denying these rights is arbitrary and illogical, especially when scientific studies have shown that gay couples have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe issue is not about gay couples wanting to get married in a church, but about being recognized as a legally binding union by the government. If we separate church and state, this issue shouldn't be a problem. However, if we allow civil unions, why not extend the same rights to marriage?\n\nThe \"separate but equal\" argument is no longer valid, as it's a form of segregation. Gay couples face many of the same challenges as heterosexual couples, including adoption issues, community acceptance, and concerns about their children adjusting to society.\n\nOne of the main concerns is how children of gay couples will be treated by their peers and society. However, this can be mitigated by educating people about the realities of gay families and promoting acceptance. In fact, cities like New York have already implemented measures to support children of gay parents.\n\nUltimately, the federal government should take a more active role in making gay marriage legal in all states. The idea that a single amendment can dictate moral values is misguided, as morality is subjective and varies from person to person. It's hypocritical for the government to impose its own moral standards on the country without considering the diverse perspectives of its citizens.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage based on flawed assumptions about the psychological nature of homosexuality. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these theories, and it's essential to rely on scientific evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people assume that just because a drug is prohibited, it lacks any benefits. However, I disagree with this notion. While I don't support making illicit substances available to the general public, I do think they can be beneficial for medicinal purposes. This is evident from the fact that many controlled substances, such as oxycodone and vicodin, are used in pharmacies due to their medicinal value, even though they are also restricted. Therefore, if we dismiss the potential benefits of marijuana simply because it's prohibited, it's illogical. I believe we should acknowledge and accept its medicinal properties.\n\nIt's also worth noting that marijuana is not similar to alcohol in the sense that it's only harmful when abused. While excessive consumption of both substances can lead to negative consequences, we shouldn't associate marijuana with the same level of danger. Rather than abruptly legalizing it, I think a more gradual approach would be more effective. We need to first break down the taboo surrounding marijuana, and then people might be more inclined to use it responsibly.\n\nUnfortunately, people's perceptions of marijuana are often skewed due to its illegal status. However, it's essential to recognize that marijuana is not as harmful as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine. By re-evaluating our perceptions of marijuana, we may be able to promote responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.",
            "I think the church has made significant changes to adapt to the modern world, and its strictness has decreased over time.  I recall attending church every Sunday as a child, dressing up in matching outfits and attending a traditional service. However, I've noticed that the church has become more casual, even during services that were once formal. For instance, the recent introduction of a 30-minute teen mass and the relaxed dress code, which includes jeans and casual wear, especially during summer when people attend in beach attire. This shift towards a more casual atmosphere has become more pronounced even in morning masses.\n\nAs for the issue of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't believe that allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is more complex than just a matter of marital status or professional choices; it's a deeply ingrained trait that may be influenced by genetics. Research suggests that people with a predisposition to pedophilia are often born with it, and it's not solely the result of their upbringing or environment. I think it's unfair to assume that allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have addressed this issue, as the underlying issue lies in the individual's inherent traits.\n\nIf anything, the Catholic Church's handling of these situations is more concerning than the institution of marriage or female priests. If they knew about the incidents and chose to cover them up, that's a separate issue altogether. However, in many cases, it's likely that they were unaware of the extent of the problem. In any case, I don't think the church's rules on marriage and priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.",
            "The Iraq War still evokes a strong reaction from me. Initially, I was open to the idea, but the September 11th attacks had left the nation reeling, and the invasion of Iraq was largely used as a pretext. The Bush administration's claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was connected to Osama Bin Laden were later proven false, which I found deeply disturbing. The war still bothers me, and I believe the Bush administration's deception of the American people on this issue is a serious issue that they have yet to acknowledge.\n\nEven Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, has since admitted that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. This, to me, constitutes a breach of trust and an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the constitution and its attempt to undermine it since September 11th is also concerning. I believe they were determined to go to war from the start.\n\nIt has been alleged that President Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration and a desire to secure the country's energy supply. This was a covert motivation, which I find unacceptable. While I think it's time to end the war, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The current plan to establish a coalition of surrounding countries to maintain order may not be effective in the long term, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and lead to more problems.\n\nThe Iraqi Parliament is currently ineffective, and the Prime Minister has limited control over the political process. Radical groups, including those led by Moqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, causing friction in the political process. This situation is complex and difficult to navigate.",
            "The speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq are somewhat unclear, as they seem uncertain and uninformed about the topic. At one point, they mention that the war appears pointless and was likely started as a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. They suggest that the US presence in Iraq is primarily driven by a desire to establish a democracy and gain access to Iraq's oil resources. However, they argue that this goal is unlikely to be achieved, and the continued presence in Iraq is only causing more problems.\n\nThe speaker also expresses empathy for families with loved ones serving in Iraq and is torn about whether the war should end or continue. On one hand, they worry that staying in Iraq will lead to the destruction of the local culture and the growth of anti-American sentiment. On the other hand, they worry that leaving Iraq will allow the country to descend into chaos.\n\nThe speaker also brings up the example of the Vietnam War, which was also an undeclared war and is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They suggest that President Bush's handling of the Iraq War may have similar consequences, and that it could damage his legacy.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the situation in Iraq is complex and will likely continue for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to establish laws governing the matters of religion, as it contradicts the principles of the separation of church and state, which is fundamental to the US constitution. This separation allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the country. \n\nBy attempting to make something illegal based on a particular church's views, the government would be overstepping its bounds and undermining the constitution. It would essentially be favoring one church's beliefs over another, which is not the government's role. In the US, most Catholics and Christians share similar views on this matter, but the government should not impose its will based on the opinions of a few individuals.\n\nThe concept of the separation of church and state is crucial to the country's foundation, and any attempt to amend the constitution to restrict religious freedom would be counterproductive and contradict the existing laws. Such an amendment would be a rare instance of government interference that restricts individual freedoms rather than limiting government power.\n\nI don't think the federal government or any government should intervene in this matter. The motivation behind pushing for this amendment seems to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the society. The proposed amendment lacks a solid reason for its implementation and could potentially have unintended consequences, such as boosting the economy or improving society.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to make something illegal should rest with the churches, not the government. The government's role is to uphold the constitution and ensure that individual freedoms are protected, not to impose its will on people's personal choices and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War raises several concerns about the government's honesty with the American people regarding its motivations for invading the country. The US government seemed to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, creating a false narrative that blurred the lines between the two events. However, the government's actions were more about manipulating public emotions and justifying the war rather than providing a genuine reason.\n\nAs someone opposed to war, I strongly believe that a preemptive strike on Iraq was unwarranted. The war in Iraq bears a striking resemblance to the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from its past mistakes. The US government mistakenly believed that removing Saddam Hussein's regime would be a straightforward process, but they were unprepared for the consequences, including the loss of American lives and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government's handling of the war was particularly concerning, as they failed to plan for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. The attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq was a complex and long-term process, similar to the one the US underwent in its own history. The US government oversimplified the process, implying it would be a short and successful endeavor.\n\nIn reality, implementing democracy is a challenging and time-consuming process that often involves years of struggle and potential civil unrest. The US government's portrayal of the situation was overly optimistic, and they were not adequately prepared for the difficulties that followed. The war in Iraq has resulted in the loss of many American lives and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable government.\n\nOne of the key considerations in this situation is the moral obligation to see the war through to its conclusion, given the US's role in removing the Iraqi government and disrupting their way of life. However, this comes at a significant cost, including the risk of further American casualties. The US government's decision to invade Iraq was also motivated by a desire to control the country's oil resources, which raises questions about the true reasons behind the war.\n\nThe US government's decision-making process was also marred by a lack of thoroughness and transparency. The fact that they made claims about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction, which were later proven false, and then failed to take action against countries like North Korea that were known to possess such weapons, further erodes trust in the government's decision-making abilities.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of the Iraq War is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict when peace will be achieved. However, it is clear that the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences, and it is essential to have a more nuanced understanding of the motivations behind the war and the complexities of establishing a democratic government in a foreign country.",
            "I've always been in favor of gay marriage and believe it's a personal choice that should not be influenced by societal norms or government intervention. Recent studies have shown that sexual orientation may be determined biologically, rather than through environmental factors, which I think is a compelling argument against limiting rights based on something outside of an individual's control. I find it inhumane to deny people the right to marry simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, politics and government should not have a role in determining personal relationships. Marriage is a personal matter that should be decided by the individuals involved, not by external authorities. I know of several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who are treated just like any other family, and I don't see why their relationships should be any different from those of heterosexual couples.\n\nI'm also aware of the scientific research suggesting that homosexuality may be linked to a chemical difference in the brain, rather than being the result of upbringing or environmental factors. This challenges the idea that people's sexual orientation is a choice, and I think it's essential to approach the issue with a more informed perspective.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, without the need for public scrutiny or government approval. It's ironic that a couple can get married in a private ceremony in Las Vegas without anyone being the wiser, but if two gay individuals want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle. I think this highlights the need to treat all marriages as private, personal affairs, rather than making them a matter of public interest.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes publicly accessible, and it's impossible to control who sees it. As a resident advisor, I've already dealt with this situation. Posting something online can shape people's perceptions of you, and sharing content about violent or sensitive topics can lead to serious consequences. If you post something like that, it might spread quickly, and authorities may take action. Even if you're just joking, it's hard to tell what others will consider serious or not.\n\nIn the case I'm referring to, a student overheard someone making a comment at school and reported it. When we looked into the matter, we found that the student had posted something on their social media that, in hindsight, seemed like a joke but became concerning given the situation. This highlights the issue of online privacy: once you post something online, it's no longer private. If you don't want people to see it, don't post it. You can't dictate how others perceive or respond to your online content.\n\nSchool officials shouldn't be friends with students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines between personal and professional relationships. However, if a student brings something to their attention, it's not an invasion of privacy. If there's a potential threat, authorities must take it seriously. It's a different story if they're monitoring private conversations or messages. A better approach is for teachers to maintain professional boundaries online and not engage with students in ways that could lead to conflicts of interest or awkward situations.\n\nIn fact, it's best for teachers, like me, not to friend our residents or students online, as we don't want to inadvertently get drawn into their personal lives or be faced with difficult decisions that aren't our responsibility. It's essential to maintain a clear professional distance online to avoid these kinds of issues.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and I believe its initial purpose has been lost sight of. The intention was to restore democracy in another country, but I'm not convinced that's the primary motivation anymore. It's possible that the war is being prolonged simply to demonstrate our power and presence on the world stage, which I think is a questionable goal.\n\nThe original motive behind the war may have been to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, which would have been a just cause. However, if personal issues were involved, that would have undermined the legitimacy of the war. I think we made our point in the first few months, and the war's continuation for over a year or more is unwarranted.\n\nIf the goal was to overthrow a tyrannical ruler and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble reason for the war. Nevertheless, I believe our reasons for fighting have become distorted and misguided. It seems that we're still at war just for the sake of being at war, rather than achieving a decisive victory or bringing the conflict to a close.\n\nI think the war has gone on for far too long, and it's time for us to step back and allow the country to take care of itself. The billions of dollars spent on this war could be better spent addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, public roads, schools, and healthcare. We have many pressing problems at home that require our attention and financial resources, and it's wasteful to continue spending on a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to clarify a question regarding online safety. It seems that someone was able to prevent a potentially life-threatening situation from occurring by accessing information online. This raises the issue of whether it's an invasion of privacy when someone posts personal information on social media platforms like Myspace. Since Myspace requires users to be friends with others to view their profiles, it implies that users have given permission to those individuals to see their information.\n\nIf someone posts content online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a large number of people. In this case, someone accessed the information and potentially saved a life. While it's not feasible for a single person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent such situations, it's also problematic to single out individuals for scrutiny. It's unclear how one would determine the intentions behind someone accessing a profile, whether it was a targeted search or a random discovery.\n\nPersonally, I have a Facebook account and it's concerning that there are individuals who can access my information. A documentary I watched showed someone who demonstrated how easily he could gather information about a girl by accessing her online profile. He was able to obtain her screen name and engage in communication with her in a matter of minutes. I'm cautious about sharing personal details online, but I also want to maintain a social connection with friends through social media. It's a delicate balance between limiting what I share and keeping my online presence private.\n\nI've noticed that some people in my classes can identify me through my online profile, even if they don't know my screen name. They can infer information about my interests, appearance, and daily schedule. While I've attempted to limit my online presence, it's challenging to strike a balance between sharing information and maintaining privacy. I only accept people I know on social media, but it's impossible to know who else might be accessing my information.\n\nI recall hearing a story from my roommate about a high school that banned students from using Myspace. I'm unsure about the reasoning behind this decision, and I question whether it's within the school's authority to restrict students' online activities. I'm not convinced it's a clear-cut issue of privacy, but rather a matter of the school's power to regulate student behavior.\n\nThese thoughts are the only ones that come to mind in relation to this topic.",
            "It's difficult to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially when it comes to joining the chorus of those who claimed to have been against it from the start. However, the general consensus worldwide, aside from the US administration, was that the war was a bad idea. Recent polls in the US, Iraq, and globally show that around 75-80% of the population, including 80% of Iraqi citizens and 70% of US troops, believe the war was misguided.\n\nThe situation has been plagued by complications since the beginning, and it's challenging to find a straightforward solution. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries are significant, and previous administrations have struggled to understand and adapt to these differences. The attempt to impose democracy on a region where it may not be welcomed can be problematic.\n\nWhile it's acknowledged that Saddam was a bad leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that might descend into chaos, as happened in Iraq. With no clear reason to stay in Iraq, it's puzzling why the US administration doesn't explore a more gradual withdrawal over the course of a year or more. The fact that a significant majority of Iraqis, including those the US is trying to help, want the US out within a year raises questions about the effectiveness of the current strategy.\n\nIf the US were to ask the Iraqis for their opinion and they said they wanted the US to leave, it would shift the responsibility for any future outcomes. In this scenario, if things went awry, the US could argue that it was the Iraqi people who made the decision to leave, rather than the US. This could potentially improve the US's position in the region, even if it's unlikely to make them the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "While I believe that gender discrimination still exists in the United States, I think it's essential to note that this issue transcends solely being a women's concern. It's also deeply intertwined with the specific field or industry one is working in. In general, women often face more significant obstacles due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite equality being touted, women struggle to find recognition and promotion opportunities because of deeply ingrained societal attitudes. Historically, women have been underrepresented in senior business positions, leading some boards to overlook qualified female candidates for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women. Men, particularly those in non-traditional fields like fashion, also face prejudice. For instance, men who stay at home to care for their children often face societal disapproval, as traditional roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry are sometimes viewed with skepticism due to stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nSocietal attitudes towards gender roles are complex and vary depending on the industry or location. While progress has been made, change is a gradual process. I believe that promoting understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped can help alleviate some of these biases. It's essential to strike a balance between promoting change and avoiding resistance, which can occur if the pace is too rapid. Ultimately, we're making progress, and it's crucial to continue working towards a more inclusive society.\n\nInterestingly, discrimination can also occur within the same gender, depending on factors like upbringing, profession, or geographical location. For example, someone from a rural area with a non-traditional background may face prejudice from city-dwellers who view them as less sophisticated due to their grammar or mannerisms. This highlights the complexity of societal attitudes and the need for continued education and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making marijuana illegal, they chose to decriminalize it. This means it's no longer considered a serious crime, but rather a minor offense, similar to receiving a traffic ticket. This change removes the severe consequences often associated with a drug charge, such as arrest, imprisonment, and a permanent record that can hinder future opportunities. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term effects of a marijuana charge can still be a concern for individuals, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications.\n\nOn the other hand, there are financial benefits to decriminalizing marijuana. The costs of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for minor marijuana offenses can be substantial, and can divert funds away from more pressing community needs. In communities where resources are limited, decriminalization can be a practical solution to free up money for essential services like education, social programs, and aid for the homeless.\n\nDenver, with its more liberal attitude towards marijuana, is a prime example of a city that has benefited financially from decriminalization. The extra funds have allowed the city to invest in initiatives that improve the quality of life for its citizens. While some people may still be hesitant about the idea of widespread marijuana use, it's essential to consider the financial and social implications of a substance's legalization.\n\nWhen it comes to marijuana, it's difficult to generalize its effects on individuals, as people react differently to the substance. Some may be able to use it responsibly, while others may struggle with its impact on their lifestyle. Similarly, both marijuana and alcohol can have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. Ultimately, it's crucial to approach the topic with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I would say that yes, but. Many traditional practices in the Catholic Church remain unchanged over time, which is good for continuity. However, it's also essential to be adaptable to change. A lot of Catholics believe they must attend church regularly and follow their doctrine strictly, which can sometimes lead to judging those who don't conform. Unfortunately, the Church often rejects individuals who don't perfectly follow their teachings or belong to other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents, one of whom was an Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This lack of tolerance is contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church's actions often contradict its principles, making it seem outdated. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's a good idea, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of pedophilia. People who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status, as it involves exploiting a child, not an adult partner. Therefore, allowing priests to marry would not be a significant deterrent. \n\nIn general, I don't think permitting priests to be married would prevent child abuse, as such behavior is often driven by other factors. It's possible that it would continue to occur regardless of the priest's marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and it's challenging to take a stance without offending someone. The conflict between separating church and state, combined with the difficulty in defining marriage, makes this topic particularly tricky. I'm not sure if marriage should be governed by the government or if it's a sacrament that should be left to individual beliefs.\n\nIn my opinion, civil unions could be a feasible alternative to marriage, as they would provide equal rights without the label of marriage. It's essential to separate personal beliefs from state recognition, and the government shouldn't dictate the type of marriage. Two individuals in a committed relationship should have the same rights and benefits, regardless of whether they're married or in a civil union.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is a complex one, but it ultimately boils down to two people committing to each other in a civil union. If a logical consensus can be reached among the states, it would be more productive to push for federal legislation rather than a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. A constitutional amendment should be reserved for significant, far-reaching issues that affect the entire nation, and this topic doesn't meet those criteria.\n\nIn essence, it's not essential to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage; it's a matter of providing equal rights and benefits to all citizens, regardless of their marital status or orientation.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, but my exposure to gay friends has created a nuanced perspective. While I don't fully agree with the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it's a federal issue, but rather something that should be decided at the state level. This approach respects the diverse opinions across different regions, such as Democratic and Republican states. Individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local laws and decisions, even if they differ from their personal views. My position is that homosexuals deserve the same rights as heterosexuals, and this should be determined by each state's discretion. I also disagree with a national ban on gay marriage and believe it should be up to individual states to decide their own policies. A president, such as Bush, shouldn't impose their views on the entire country, as they don't live in every state and their decisions won't last forever. Ultimately, state governments should have the autonomy to make decisions that affect their residents, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker begins by downplaying the significance of their initial hesitation to weigh in on the issue, but eventually shares their thoughts on the matter. They view Myspace, a public platform, as a place where users post content intended for the public to see. The speaker acknowledges that posting on the internet comes with the understanding that it will be accessible to anyone, including school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, the speaker believes that school officials have the right to monitor student activity, even if it's not directly related to the school's official name. They feel that officials could still access the content through students' homes. The speaker also suggests that school officials may use social media to identify students engaging in prohibited behavior, such as underage drinking or smoking.\n\nHowever, the speaker has reservations about schools monitoring students' online activity solely for the purpose of getting them in trouble. They consider this an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, they believe that monitoring can be justified if it's done to prevent harm or make the school a safer environment.\n\nThe speaker shares a personal anecdote about a teacher discussing the importance of ensuring student safety, including conducting lockdown drills and drills in response to potential terrorist threats. They draw a connection between these drills and the school's efforts to prevent a school shooting. The speaker concludes that the school officials in this case were acting to prevent a tragedy, much like the ones that have occurred at schools like Columbine.\n\nUltimately, the speaker reiterates that they don't think monitoring is an invasion of privacy if it's done to prevent harm or improve school safety.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of going to war after 9/11 because I had a personal connection to the event. However, upon further reflection, I believe we overlooked the long-term consequences and rushed into the conflict without a solid plan. This decision seemed to be driven by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a thoughtful approach. As a result, we may have inadvertently made matters worse.\n\nI now strongly oppose the war, and I think it was a misguided endeavor. I believe that as long as the local parties are fighting amongst themselves, they won't be a threat to us. We shouldn't have expected to impose our will on them and expect them to cooperate. Unfortunately, our involvement in their conflict has led me to become desensitized to the situation, and I struggle to see them as fellow human beings.\n\nThe nature of war in their culture is vastly different from ours, and I don't think they were motivated by a desire to improve their country, but rather to expel us. I think it would have been wiser for us to leave them to their own devices, rather than attempting to impose our will. Our objectives were unclear, and we were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a rational consideration of the consequences. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq may have been understandable given the circumstances, but I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan for the occupation.\n\nIn hindsight, I think we were more focused on exacting revenge than on creating a lasting solution. I don't believe we were equipped to handle the complexity of their culture and the local dynamics. We lacked unity and a clear understanding of our objectives, which ultimately hindered our progress. I don't think we can change the people of the region; they are who they are, and we should accept that.\n\nIn my opinion, we're not making enough progress in the region, and our continued presence is more detrimental to ourselves than to the locals. I fear that even if we stay for a long time, the moment we leave, the situation will collapse, and we'll be no better off. I believe it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties resolve their issues without our interference."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to adapt its views to some extent in order to prevent a decline in its following. The Church's strong stance on certain issues, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, can be perceived as outdated by many people. If the Church were to adopt a more modern and accepting approach to these matters, it might be able to retain its followers. However, some individuals are already distancing themselves from the Church due to its views on these topics.\n\nIndividuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may not feel comfortable being part of a community that rejects these practices. Similarly, those who advocate for more flexible rules within the Church, such as allowing female priests or married priests, might also feel out of place. The Church's stance on these issues has led to a rift between its traditional views and the changing values of the general public.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have made a difference. The Catholic Church's emphasis on devotion to God does not necessarily preclude the idea of priests having a family life or other personal relationships. Like others, priests have personal aspects outside of their profession, and there is no reason why they cannot balance their devotion to God with their personal lives.",
            "In my opinion, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is not something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. It's unfair to deny the right to marry to two people of the same sex simply because of their sexual orientation. I don't think the government should interfere in this matter, as it's not a legal issue or a concern for national security. Rather, it's a matter of personal identity and individual rights. People are born with their orientation, and it's not something they can change. Therefore, I don't think it's right for the government to dictate who can or cannot get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the government should respect people's choices and identities, especially when it comes to their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be stigmatized or punished for being who they are. I believe the government should stay out of this issue, as it's not within their jurisdiction to make decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nIn short, I think gay marriage should be recognized and respected, and the government should not interfere with people's choices and identities. It's not a matter of choice but rather a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be judged or punished for it.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there are no valid reasons to deny it.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is entirely untrue. In fact, same-sex relationships have distinct characteristics that set them apart from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to consider them the same. Ultimately, they are like two sides of the same coin – each with their unique aspects.\n\nWhat's more, there are numerous civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits, which are currently denied to gay couples. For instance, a partner of a gay individual may not be allowed to visit them in the hospital or make medical decisions on their behalf, simply because they are not considered family. This is not only unfair but also illogical, especially when the couple has committed to spending their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of success and share the same factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. Therefore, it's clear that a same-sex relationship is essentially the same as any other.\n\nOne of the main issues people get hung up on is the differentiation between a civil union and a marriage certificate. However, if a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. The idea that some people can have a marriage certificate while others cannot is akin to segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children raised by gay parents. However, the same concerns can be applied to any family unit, regardless of their sexual orientation. In fact, research has shown that children of gay parents are not negatively affected by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nIn reality, the main issue is not the sexual orientation of parents but how society treats their children. Unfortunately, this often results in bullying, exclusion, and other social ills. As a society, we should strive to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all families.\n\nThe federal government should take an active role in making gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment should be abolished, as it is based on personal moral beliefs rather than the well-being of all citizens. It's essential to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose its own moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMoreover, some people's objections to gay marriage are based on outdated and debunked theories about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or personality defects. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and we should rely on credible research and institutions rather than popular opinion.\n\nUltimately, by accepting and recognizing the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more just and equitable society.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It's worth noting that simply because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. Although I don't think it should be readily available to the public, I do believe it could be used for medicinal purposes. This is because the fact that a substance is outlawed doesn't necessarily mean it's without benefits.\n\nThere are many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are used in pharmacies because they have medical benefits, despite being illegal. If we dismiss the advantages of marijuana solely because of its taboo status, I don't think that's a rational approach. Instead, I believe it's essential to acknowledge its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not accurate to compare marijuana to alcohol, as abusing marijuana can lead to negative consequences, similar to alcohol abuse. However, just as responsible consumption of alcohol is possible, I think it's plausible to integrate marijuana into society gradually, rather than making it completely legal at once. This gradual approach could help prevent abuse.\n\nThe stigma surrounding marijuana stems from its prohibited status, but this image is unjustified. Compared to highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine, marijuana is relatively harmless. If we can change this negative perception, people may be more likely to use it responsibly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict in its traditional ways. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed the atmosphere and dress code have evolved. When I was younger, I'd attend a private school and see my friends at church on weekends, and it was a more formal occasion. However, the church has introduced shorter masses, such as a 30-minute teenage mass, and people are now allowed to dress more casually, especially during the summer months. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere is noticeable, even in morning masses where people used to dress up.\n\nOne of the most striking changes is the casual wear, with people wearing jeans and khakis, which is a significant departure from the formal attire of the past. Although this may not be ideal for everyone, it's a reflection of the church's effort to become more approachable and inclusive.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or the church's policies. Research suggests that pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with this inclination. While it's essential to address and prevent abuse, I don't believe the church's stance on marriage or ordination would have made a difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nHowever, if the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue altogether, and the church's actions would be unacceptable. In general, I don't think the church's rules or policies are the primary cause of pedophilia; rather, it's a deeper issue that requires a more comprehensive approach to address and prevent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone changes to become more modern and inclusive, I don't think these changes would have prevented the recent scandals involving pedophilia. Ultimately, the church's response to these incidents will be crucial in rebuilding trust with their community.",
            "I initially had some reservations about the premise, but given the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, I think the invasion of Iraq was used as a pretext. The Bush administration inaccurately linked the war with Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. This misinformation still bothers me and, in my opinion, the Iraq war remains a contentious issue.\n\nWhat disturbs me even more is the Bush administration's apparent willingness to deceive the American people and their refusal to acknowledge these fabrications. Colin Powell, for instance, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. I find this behavior to be a serious breach of trust and, in my view, constitutes a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nI believe the Bush administration has disregarded the US Constitution since September 11th and has been trying to undermine it. It seems they entered office with the intention of going to war, and their motivations may have been driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy resources.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on for too long, withdrawing troops now may lead to further chaos, potentially resulting in civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution of enlisting regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the country may not be the best option either, as it could lead to long-term issues with Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government.\n\nThe current Parliament seems ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control over the political process. Radical elements continue to vie for power, causing friction within the government. In my opinion, the situation is complex and difficult to articulate without using strong language.",
            "I'm hesitant to discuss my views on the Iraq War.  I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to share my thoughts.  It seems that the war has become somewhat pointless, especially since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think our initial involvement was likely driven by a desire for revenge following the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not well-informed about the details of the war, but I do know that we're staying in Iraq to help establish democracy and gain access to their oil resources. However, this approach is causing widespread resentment and unrest. If we stay, we'll likely face a long-term commitment to establish democracy, which might be a futile endeavor. On the other hand, if we leave, Iraqis might feel betrayed and struggle to rebuild their country without our support.\n\nTo be frank, this topic is particularly challenging for me, as I'm not well-versed in the complexities of the Iraq War. However, I have some thoughts on the matter. While I initially thought the war should continue, I've come to realize that it's more about demonstrating American power and influence rather than a genuine attempt to achieve a lasting solution. The war's legacy, much like the Vietnam War, could be seen as an unnecessary and costly endeavor.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether the war should end or continue, as I'm aware of families who have lost loved ones in the conflict and I empathize with their struggles. However, staying in Iraq might be counterproductive, as it could lead to further cultural clashes and fuel anti-American sentiment. The potential for the war to escalate and create more problems seems high.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the Iraq War will likely be a long-term issue, with no clear resolution in sight. It's a complex and multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for a state to legitimize it, as it seems to be a matter for churches to decide. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, clearly implies that this should be left to individual churches rather than the government. By attempting to enforce laws or restrictions, the government would be contradicting the constitution's principles and undermining the concept of religious tolerance in the US. Furthermore, making an amendment on this issue would be counterproductive and restrictive, as it would be one of the few instances where the government would be limiting the people's freedoms rather than the other way around.\n\nI believe that the federal government and all local governments should refrain from getting involved in this matter, as it boils down to personal beliefs and preferences rather than a pressing societal issue. The push for an amendment seems to be driven by the president's personal Catholic views, indicating a bias towards a specific religion over others. Churches should be free to decide this issue without government interference, and there is no compelling reason to justify an amendment other than personal opinions. In fact, an amendment might have unforeseen benefits for the economy and society, potentially even boosting it in some way.\n\nIn summary, I have expressed my main points and strongly believe that the government should not interfere with the decision-making process of churches on this matter.",
            "The Iraq war raises several concerns about the honesty of the US government in their reasons for invading Iraq. Many believe that the administration manipulated public opinion by linking the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This emotional manipulation played on the public's outrage following the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to the invasion in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I agree that the Iraq war is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where similar mistakes were made. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but failed to prepare for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. This lack of preparedness has led to a long and difficult occupation, with a significant number of American casualties.\n\nIn retrospect, the US government should have learned from past experiences, such as the Vietnam War, where they attempted to impose democracy by removing a government and fighting insurgents. This approach is often challenging, especially when fighting a war against the local population rather than a traditional army. The US government should have considered all possible outcomes and prepared accordingly, but it appears that they were not adequately prepared for the situation in Iraq.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in the loss of many American lives, and the Iraqi people are still struggling to establish a stable government. The idea that the US government could impose democracy in Iraq quickly and easily is unrealistic, as it took years for democracy to take hold in the US. The government's portrayal of the conflict as a short and successful endeavor was misleading, and the reality is that it is a complex and difficult process.\n\nDeciding whether to continue the war is a difficult decision, as it is hard to abandon the people who have been affected by the conflict. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a difficult decision to justify. The real reasons for invading Iraq, such as access to oil and control over resources, also raise questions about the government's motives.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq war is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it is essential to critically evaluate the government's actions and decisions. The war has resulted in significant human and financial costs, and it is crucial to learn from past mistakes and consider all possible outcomes before embarking on such a significant undertaking. Ultimately, it is hoped that the conflict will end soon, and peace will be established in Iraq, but this may not be a likely outcome.",
            "Let's start by discussing my stance on gay marriage. I've always been a supporter of it, and I believe that it's a personal preference rather than something that can be dictated by societal norms or expectations. Recent studies suggest that there could be a biological component to a person's sexual orientation, rather than it being solely a product of their upbringing or environment. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't have a say in matters of marriage, as it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families on a private level. I've seen firsthand how gay couples in my neighborhood live their lives and function as any other family would, yet they're still denied the right to get married due to societal and legal restrictions. I find it absurd that some politicians, like President Bush, are attempting to redefine the meaning of marriage to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a chemical basis for a person's sexual orientation, which is not determined by their upbringing or life experiences. For instance, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father may not be more likely to be gay. This suggests that there's a biological component to sexual orientation that cannot be changed.\n\nThe issue of marriage should be a private matter, similar to how a straight couple can get married in a small, intimate ceremony without drawing attention to themselves. However, when two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle, as seen in the media coverage of high-profile gay weddings. I believe that marriage should be a personal, private decision that's not subject to public scrutiny or government approval.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge, and you have no control over who sees it. As an RA, I've experienced this firsthand. Once something is out there, it can color people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. Even if you think you're just joking, someone might take it seriously, and it could be misinterpreted. This is why the internet is a public forum – everyone can see it, including your friends on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook.\n\nFor instance, if someone overhears a concerning comment at school and reports it, the school officials will investigate, even if they have to look through the student's social media profiles to gather more information. This is not an invasion of privacy because the information was already publicly available online. However, the school should not be actively monitoring students' private conversations or social media without a valid reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with their students on social media or try to gather information about them in that way. This can blur the lines between their roles and create an uncomfortable situation. It's better to maintain a professional boundary.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want something to be public, don't post it online. You can't control how others will interpret your words, and you can't dictate what they take seriously or not. If concerns about a student's online behavior are brought to the school's attention, they have a responsibility to act, but they should do so in a way that respects students' privacy and maintains a professional relationship.",
            "The war has been ongoing for too long and has lost sight of its original purpose, which was to restore democracy to another country. Initially, the intention was to bring democracy to a nation without a fair political system, but it seems that personal motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, might have played a role. The true justification for the war has been compromised, and it appears that we're fighting solely to prove our military strength. \n\nI believe that the initial invasion made a significant statement, but the prolonged conflict has been unnecessary. If the goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for war. However, over time, the reasoning behind the war has become distorted and misconceived, with the primary objective now seeming to be an excuse to continue fighting. \n\nIt's time to bring the war to an end and let the local government take responsibility for its own affairs. The financial burden of the war, which has already drained billions of dollars from our economy, should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. These are problems that desperately require funding, and it's unacceptable that we're spending our resources on a war that has lost its original purpose. The lives of our citizens are being lost, and it's time for us to reevaluate our priorities and allocate our funds more effectively.",
            "The speaker is seeking clarification on a situation where a potentially life-saving action was taken after someone online discovered information about an individual. They argue that if you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to many people, even if it requires being friends with the person to view their profile on a site like Myspace. The speaker acknowledges that this raises concerns about privacy, but also believes that this was a positive outcome in this case.\n\nHowever, they also raise concerns about the potential for unfair treatment if authorities were to monitor students' online profiles without a clear reason. This could lead to discrimination against certain individuals. The speaker questions the appropriateness of having someone's job be to review students' online profiles.\n\nThe speaker also shares their personal experience with online safety, mentioning a TV show that demonstrated how easily personal information can be obtained from social media profiles. They express concerns about sharing information online, but also value the ability to communicate with friends through social media. They mention the difficulty of balancing online safety with the need to share information.\n\nThe speaker also brings up an instance where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which they found puzzling. They question the school's authority to dictate what students can and cannot do online, especially in relation to freedom of expression and privacy.",
            "It's difficult for me to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially since I was initially against it. However, the general consensus globally has shifted, and it's hard to deny that the majority of people now view the war as a bad idea. In fact, according to various polls, including those in the US, Iraq, and worldwide, a significant majority of the population – approximately 75-80% – think that the invasion was a mistake. Even a considerable number of US troops stationed in Iraq believe that the war was a poor decision and that the country should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation has been chaotic from the beginning, and it's challenging to find a solution that won't lead to further complications. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem insurmountable, and attempts to impose democracy on areas where it may not be suitable have been misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, the cost of invading Iraq was too high, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking such drastic action.\n\nI struggle to see a valid reason for the US to stay in Iraq beyond the initial invasion. Despite the administration's potential plans for a gradual withdrawal or addressing potential problems associated with leaving, I haven't found a compelling argument for extending our presence. If we were to ask the Iraqi people, a significant majority would likely say that we should leave within a year or even sooner. This raises questions about our motives and the true impact of our actions. If we were to follow the Iraqi people's wishes and leave, we could at least avoid being responsible for any further chaos and maintain a somewhat positive image in the region.",
            "Gender inequality remains a significant issue in the United States, and it's not solely limited to women. The level of difficulty in achieving equality varies depending on the field of work, with women often facing a \"glass ceiling\" in male-dominated industries. Women may possess the necessary qualifications for a job but are overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations and historical biases. Similarly, men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, face scrutiny and are often judged for not conforming to traditional masculine norms. \n\nIn the fashion industry, men may encounter skepticism because their interests and styles diverge from traditional male expectations. This can lead to a lack of understanding and respect from others. However, as women take on higher positions and become more accepted in the business world, and as men assume non-traditional roles, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nTo effectively address gender inequality, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. A gradual and subtle approach is necessary, as forcing change can lead to resistance. Progress has been made, and continued efforts are underway to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nInterestingly, individuals from different regions and backgrounds may also face discrimination, with people from rural areas or with non-standard grammar facing skepticism despite their intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of social biases and the need for ongoing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance across various dimensions, including gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making it a full-fledged crime, some places have decriminalized marijuana, which means it's no longer an offense that leads to arrest and imprisonment. Instead, it's treated more like a minor traffic infraction, resulting in a citation rather than a lengthy court process. However, even with decriminalization, individuals still worry about the potential consequences, such as difficulties during job interviews or other professional settings, which can be just as severe as having a full-fledged drug charge.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of decriminalization is that arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals can be extremely costly. This can be a significant burden for municipalities struggling financially. In fact, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana due to philosophical differences, even if it would free up resources for other essential services like public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nIn areas like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization can be beneficial, as it can lead to increased revenue for local governments. This additional funding can be used to support various community programs. However, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available, as it could lead to issues like public consumption and driving under the influence.\n\nWhile marijuana may not have the same immediate impairing effects as alcohol on motor skills, it can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. The effects of substances can vary greatly from person to person, and individual personalities play a significant role in how they react to substances. Some people can handle them with moderation, while others may not. This makes it challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana. Nonetheless, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with caution and understanding.",
            "I think I'd agree, but with reservations. On one hand, the traditional practices of the Catholic Church have been consistent over a long time, and it's beneficial to have roots in history. However, it's equally essential to be open to change. Many Catholics believe in attending church regularly, but this can sometimes lead to rigidity and exclusivity. I've observed that the Catholic Church can be quite strict and unforgiving towards those who don't adhere to its doctrine precisely or belong to other faiths. This is evident in instances where individuals from other denominations or with different backgrounds, like my parents who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, face difficulties being accepted or having their unions recognized.\n\nIt seems contradictory for the Catholic Church to preach love and acceptance of others while being intolerant towards those who don't conform. The church's teachings emphasize the importance of loving others, yet its practices often contradict this message. This disconnect is partly due to outdated traditions that the church adheres to despite their incongruence with the values it espouses.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's worth considering, but I'm unsure if it would necessarily lead to a reduction in instances of predatory behavior. Pedophilia is a complex issue, and I believe it's unlikely that allowing priests to be married would eliminate the problem. Those who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIn essence, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to prevent child abuse, as the underlying issues are more profound. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than seeking superficial solutions.",
            "I'm still undecided on this topic, and it's challenging to take a stance because it involves a fine line between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. Defining marriage can be a delicate matter that may offend certain groups, so I'm hesitant to make a decision. In my opinion, civil unions are a better alternative, as they focus on the union between two individuals rather than the idea of marriage as a sacrament. If we consider marriage a civil union, the government should not discriminate based on the couple's religious affiliation or background.\n\nIf all states can reach a consensus, it would be ideal to make it a federal law. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage, as it's a relatively minor issue that doesn't warrant such a drastic change. The constitution should not be amended lightly, especially for a cause that may not be widely supported.\n\nIn essence, I don't think banning gay marriage is significant enough to alter the constitution, and it's not a matter that should be elevated to that level.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household made me somewhat ambivalent about homosexuality, partly due to my close relationships with gay friends. While I may not fully agree with the lifestyle choice, I believe it should be legalized and allowed to be decided on a state-by-state basis rather than a national level. \n\nSince the US has a mix of Democratic and Republican states, each state's laws and attitudes on gay marriage will likely reflect their dominant party's stance. Therefore, if someone chooses to reside in a Democratic state that supports gay marriage, it's logical to respect their decision rather than trying to disagree with it. My stance is that homosexuals should have equal rights to heterosexuals, and it's up to individual states to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe former President Bush overstepped his bounds by trying to impose a nationwide ban on gay marriage. As he no longer holds office, his decision wouldn't apply to all states, and future presidents could potentially reverse it. I think decisions like these should be left to individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices rather than a single national leader imposing his will.",
            "The speaker argues that a post on a public platform like Myspace can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. They believe that if something is posted on the internet, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, as it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The speaker thinks that if officials use the internet to monitor student activity and prevent potential issues, such as substance abuse or violence, it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the speaker also believes that if officials are searching for students who have broken rules or engaged in misconduct, it's an invasion of privacy. They acknowledge that it's easier to express oneself when writing, and that the internet can make it difficult to keep personal thoughts and actions private. The speaker thinks that even if they're careful, something they've written or said online could come back to haunt them in the future.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that school officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and that this includes being proactive in preventing potential threats. They use the example of lockdown drills and emergency preparedness as a way to illustrate this point. In the context of the school shooting at Columbine, the speaker believes that officials were justified in monitoring student activity online to prevent a similar incident.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that if school officials use online monitoring to make the school a safer place, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, if they're simply trying to catch students who have broken rules, it's an overstep.",
            "At first, I strongly supported the war in response to the events of 9/11, which had a significant personal impact on me. However, I soon began to question our approach and the consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional aftermath of the tragedy led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term effects of our involvement in the conflict.\n\nUpon reflection, I think we entered the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to its backfiring on us. Our decision to intervene in the region without a well-thought-out strategy was misguided, and it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation. \n\nNow, I'm firmly against the war, and I don't think it achieved its intended goals. In my opinion, the ongoing conflict between various factions in the region means that they're not capable of posing a threat to us. Our presence there doesn't seem to be making a significant difference, and I've come to feel detached from the situation.\n\nI've come to view the people in the region as being more focused on internal strife than on building their country. I believe their approach to war is fundamentally different from ours, and it's driven by a desire to expel foreign forces rather than improve their situation. In light of this, I think it's time for us to leave and not get entangled in their conflicts.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11, rather than a thoughtful consideration of the consequences. The decision to go to war in Iraq was also influenced by President Bush's response to public sentiment. While I understand the emotional context, I believe we could have approached the situation more thoughtfully and planned our actions more carefully.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think we were the right people to try to change the dynamics in the region. Their problems run deeper, and I think they will always be prone to internal conflict. Our prolonged presence in the region is not making a significant difference, and I believe we're ultimately harming ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify continuing our involvement. I think it's time for us to withdraw our forces, as the situation is unlikely to improve as long as we're there. Our continued presence will only lead to further instability in the region, and it's not a sustainable solution."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to adapt its views to some extent in order to prevent a decline in its following. The Church's strong stance on certain issues, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, can be perceived as outdated by many people. If the Church were to adopt a more modern and accepting approach to these matters, it might be able to retain its followers. However, some individuals are already distancing themselves from the Church due to its views on these topics.\n\nIndividuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may not feel comfortable being part of a community that rejects these practices. Similarly, those who advocate for more flexible rules within the Church, such as allowing female priests or married priests, might also feel out of place. The Church's stance on these issues has led to a rift between its traditional views and the changing values of the general public.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have made a difference. The Catholic Church's emphasis on devotion to God does not necessarily preclude the idea of priests having a family life or other personal relationships. Like others, priests have personal aspects outside of their profession, and there is no reason why they cannot balance their devotion to God with their personal lives.",
            "In my opinion, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is not something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. It's unfair to deny the right to marry to two people of the same sex simply because of their sexual orientation. I don't think the government should interfere in this matter, as it's not a legal issue or a concern for national security. Rather, it's a matter of personal identity and individual rights. People are born with their orientation, and it's not something they can change. Therefore, I don't think it's right for the government to dictate who can or cannot get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the government should respect people's choices and identities, especially when it comes to their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be stigmatized or punished for being who they are. I believe the government should stay out of this issue, as it's not within their jurisdiction to make decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nIn short, I think gay marriage should be recognized and respected, and the government should not interfere with people's choices and identities. It's not a matter of choice but rather a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be judged or punished for it.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there are no valid reasons to deny it.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is entirely untrue. In fact, same-sex relationships have distinct characteristics that set them apart from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to consider them the same. Ultimately, they are like two sides of the same coin – each with their unique aspects.\n\nWhat's more, there are numerous civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits, which are currently denied to gay couples. For instance, a partner of a gay individual may not be allowed to visit them in the hospital or make medical decisions on their behalf, simply because they are not considered family. This is not only unfair but also illogical, especially when the couple has committed to spending their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of success and share the same factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. Therefore, it's clear that a same-sex relationship is essentially the same as any other.\n\nOne of the main issues people get hung up on is the differentiation between a civil union and a marriage certificate. However, if a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. The idea that some people can have a marriage certificate while others cannot is akin to segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children raised by gay parents. However, the same concerns can be applied to any family unit, regardless of their sexual orientation. In fact, research has shown that children of gay parents are not negatively affected by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nIn reality, the main issue is not the sexual orientation of parents but how society treats their children. Unfortunately, this often results in bullying, exclusion, and other social ills. As a society, we should strive to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all families.\n\nThe federal government should take an active role in making gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment should be abolished, as it is based on personal moral beliefs rather than the well-being of all citizens. It's essential to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose its own moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMoreover, some people's objections to gay marriage are based on outdated and debunked theories about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or personality defects. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and we should rely on credible research and institutions rather than popular opinion.\n\nUltimately, by accepting and recognizing the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more just and equitable society.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It's worth noting that simply because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. Although I don't think it should be readily available to the public, I do believe it could be used for medicinal purposes. This is because the fact that a substance is outlawed doesn't necessarily mean it's without benefits.\n\nThere are many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are used in pharmacies because they have medical benefits, despite being illegal. If we dismiss the advantages of marijuana solely because of its taboo status, I don't think that's a rational approach. Instead, I believe it's essential to acknowledge its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not accurate to compare marijuana to alcohol, as abusing marijuana can lead to negative consequences, similar to alcohol abuse. However, just as responsible consumption of alcohol is possible, I think it's plausible to integrate marijuana into society gradually, rather than making it completely legal at once. This gradual approach could help prevent abuse.\n\nThe stigma surrounding marijuana stems from its prohibited status, but this image is unjustified. Compared to highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine, marijuana is relatively harmless. If we can change this negative perception, people may be more likely to use it responsibly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict in its traditional ways. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed the atmosphere and dress code have evolved. When I was younger, I'd attend a private school and see my friends at church on weekends, and it was a more formal occasion. However, the church has introduced shorter masses, such as a 30-minute teenage mass, and people are now allowed to dress more casually, especially during the summer months. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere is noticeable, even in morning masses where people used to dress up.\n\nOne of the most striking changes is the casual wear, with people wearing jeans and khakis, which is a significant departure from the formal attire of the past. Although this may not be ideal for everyone, it's a reflection of the church's effort to become more approachable and inclusive.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or the church's policies. Research suggests that pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with this inclination. While it's essential to address and prevent abuse, I don't believe the church's stance on marriage or ordination would have made a difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nHowever, if the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue altogether, and the church's actions would be unacceptable. In general, I don't think the church's rules or policies are the primary cause of pedophilia; rather, it's a deeper issue that requires a more comprehensive approach to address and prevent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone changes to become more modern and inclusive, I don't think these changes would have prevented the recent scandals involving pedophilia. Ultimately, the church's response to these incidents will be crucial in rebuilding trust with their community.",
            "I initially had some reservations about the premise, but given the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, I think the invasion of Iraq was used as a pretext. The Bush administration inaccurately linked the war with Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. This misinformation still bothers me and, in my opinion, the Iraq war remains a contentious issue.\n\nWhat disturbs me even more is the Bush administration's apparent willingness to deceive the American people and their refusal to acknowledge these fabrications. Colin Powell, for instance, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. I find this behavior to be a serious breach of trust and, in my view, constitutes a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nI believe the Bush administration has disregarded the US Constitution since September 11th and has been trying to undermine it. It seems they entered office with the intention of going to war, and their motivations may have been driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy resources.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on for too long, withdrawing troops now may lead to further chaos, potentially resulting in civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution of enlisting regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the country may not be the best option either, as it could lead to long-term issues with Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government.\n\nThe current Parliament seems ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control over the political process. Radical elements continue to vie for power, causing friction within the government. In my opinion, the situation is complex and difficult to articulate without using strong language.",
            "I'm hesitant to discuss my views on the Iraq War.  I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to share my thoughts.  It seems that the war has become somewhat pointless, especially since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think our initial involvement was likely driven by a desire for revenge following the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not well-informed about the details of the war, but I do know that we're staying in Iraq to help establish democracy and gain access to their oil resources. However, this approach is causing widespread resentment and unrest. If we stay, we'll likely face a long-term commitment to establish democracy, which might be a futile endeavor. On the other hand, if we leave, Iraqis might feel betrayed and struggle to rebuild their country without our support.\n\nTo be frank, this topic is particularly challenging for me, as I'm not well-versed in the complexities of the Iraq War. However, I have some thoughts on the matter. While I initially thought the war should continue, I've come to realize that it's more about demonstrating American power and influence rather than a genuine attempt to achieve a lasting solution. The war's legacy, much like the Vietnam War, could be seen as an unnecessary and costly endeavor.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether the war should end or continue, as I'm aware of families who have lost loved ones in the conflict and I empathize with their struggles. However, staying in Iraq might be counterproductive, as it could lead to further cultural clashes and fuel anti-American sentiment. The potential for the war to escalate and create more problems seems high.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the Iraq War will likely be a long-term issue, with no clear resolution in sight. It's a complex and multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for a state to legitimize it, as it seems to be a matter for churches to decide. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, clearly implies that this should be left to individual churches rather than the government. By attempting to enforce laws or restrictions, the government would be contradicting the constitution's principles and undermining the concept of religious tolerance in the US. Furthermore, making an amendment on this issue would be counterproductive and restrictive, as it would be one of the few instances where the government would be limiting the people's freedoms rather than the other way around.\n\nI believe that the federal government and all local governments should refrain from getting involved in this matter, as it boils down to personal beliefs and preferences rather than a pressing societal issue. The push for an amendment seems to be driven by the president's personal Catholic views, indicating a bias towards a specific religion over others. Churches should be free to decide this issue without government interference, and there is no compelling reason to justify an amendment other than personal opinions. In fact, an amendment might have unforeseen benefits for the economy and society, potentially even boosting it in some way.\n\nIn summary, I have expressed my main points and strongly believe that the government should not interfere with the decision-making process of churches on this matter.",
            "The Iraq war raises several concerns about the honesty of the US government in their reasons for invading Iraq. Many believe that the administration manipulated public opinion by linking the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This emotional manipulation played on the public's outrage following the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to the invasion in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I agree that the Iraq war is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where similar mistakes were made. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but failed to prepare for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. This lack of preparedness has led to a long and difficult occupation, with a significant number of American casualties.\n\nIn retrospect, the US government should have learned from past experiences, such as the Vietnam War, where they attempted to impose democracy by removing a government and fighting insurgents. This approach is often challenging, especially when fighting a war against the local population rather than a traditional army. The US government should have considered all possible outcomes and prepared accordingly, but it appears that they were not adequately prepared for the situation in Iraq.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in the loss of many American lives, and the Iraqi people are still struggling to establish a stable government. The idea that the US government could impose democracy in Iraq quickly and easily is unrealistic, as it took years for democracy to take hold in the US. The government's portrayal of the conflict as a short and successful endeavor was misleading, and the reality is that it is a complex and difficult process.\n\nDeciding whether to continue the war is a difficult decision, as it is hard to abandon the people who have been affected by the conflict. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a difficult decision to justify. The real reasons for invading Iraq, such as access to oil and control over resources, also raise questions about the government's motives.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq war is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it is essential to critically evaluate the government's actions and decisions. The war has resulted in significant human and financial costs, and it is crucial to learn from past mistakes and consider all possible outcomes before embarking on such a significant undertaking. Ultimately, it is hoped that the conflict will end soon, and peace will be established in Iraq, but this may not be a likely outcome.",
            "Let's start by discussing my stance on gay marriage. I've always been a supporter of it, and I believe that it's a personal preference rather than something that can be dictated by societal norms or expectations. Recent studies suggest that there could be a biological component to a person's sexual orientation, rather than it being solely a product of their upbringing or environment. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't have a say in matters of marriage, as it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families on a private level. I've seen firsthand how gay couples in my neighborhood live their lives and function as any other family would, yet they're still denied the right to get married due to societal and legal restrictions. I find it absurd that some politicians, like President Bush, are attempting to redefine the meaning of marriage to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a chemical basis for a person's sexual orientation, which is not determined by their upbringing or life experiences. For instance, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father may not be more likely to be gay. This suggests that there's a biological component to sexual orientation that cannot be changed.\n\nThe issue of marriage should be a private matter, similar to how a straight couple can get married in a small, intimate ceremony without drawing attention to themselves. However, when two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle, as seen in the media coverage of high-profile gay weddings. I believe that marriage should be a personal, private decision that's not subject to public scrutiny or government approval.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge, and you have no control over who sees it. As an RA, I've experienced this firsthand. Once something is out there, it can color people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. Even if you think you're just joking, someone might take it seriously, and it could be misinterpreted. This is why the internet is a public forum – everyone can see it, including your friends on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook.\n\nFor instance, if someone overhears a concerning comment at school and reports it, the school officials will investigate, even if they have to look through the student's social media profiles to gather more information. This is not an invasion of privacy because the information was already publicly available online. However, the school should not be actively monitoring students' private conversations or social media without a valid reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with their students on social media or try to gather information about them in that way. This can blur the lines between their roles and create an uncomfortable situation. It's better to maintain a professional boundary.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want something to be public, don't post it online. You can't control how others will interpret your words, and you can't dictate what they take seriously or not. If concerns about a student's online behavior are brought to the school's attention, they have a responsibility to act, but they should do so in a way that respects students' privacy and maintains a professional relationship.",
            "The war has been ongoing for too long and has lost sight of its original purpose, which was to restore democracy to another country. Initially, the intention was to bring democracy to a nation without a fair political system, but it seems that personal motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, might have played a role. The true justification for the war has been compromised, and it appears that we're fighting solely to prove our military strength. \n\nI believe that the initial invasion made a significant statement, but the prolonged conflict has been unnecessary. If the goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for war. However, over time, the reasoning behind the war has become distorted and misconceived, with the primary objective now seeming to be an excuse to continue fighting. \n\nIt's time to bring the war to an end and let the local government take responsibility for its own affairs. The financial burden of the war, which has already drained billions of dollars from our economy, should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. These are problems that desperately require funding, and it's unacceptable that we're spending our resources on a war that has lost its original purpose. The lives of our citizens are being lost, and it's time for us to reevaluate our priorities and allocate our funds more effectively.",
            "The speaker is seeking clarification on a situation where a potentially life-saving action was taken after someone online discovered information about an individual. They argue that if you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to many people, even if it requires being friends with the person to view their profile on a site like Myspace. The speaker acknowledges that this raises concerns about privacy, but also believes that this was a positive outcome in this case.\n\nHowever, they also raise concerns about the potential for unfair treatment if authorities were to monitor students' online profiles without a clear reason. This could lead to discrimination against certain individuals. The speaker questions the appropriateness of having someone's job be to review students' online profiles.\n\nThe speaker also shares their personal experience with online safety, mentioning a TV show that demonstrated how easily personal information can be obtained from social media profiles. They express concerns about sharing information online, but also value the ability to communicate with friends through social media. They mention the difficulty of balancing online safety with the need to share information.\n\nThe speaker also brings up an instance where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which they found puzzling. They question the school's authority to dictate what students can and cannot do online, especially in relation to freedom of expression and privacy.",
            "It's difficult for me to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially since I was initially against it. However, the general consensus globally has shifted, and it's hard to deny that the majority of people now view the war as a bad idea. In fact, according to various polls, including those in the US, Iraq, and worldwide, a significant majority of the population – approximately 75-80% – think that the invasion was a mistake. Even a considerable number of US troops stationed in Iraq believe that the war was a poor decision and that the country should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation has been chaotic from the beginning, and it's challenging to find a solution that won't lead to further complications. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem insurmountable, and attempts to impose democracy on areas where it may not be suitable have been misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, the cost of invading Iraq was too high, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking such drastic action.\n\nI struggle to see a valid reason for the US to stay in Iraq beyond the initial invasion. Despite the administration's potential plans for a gradual withdrawal or addressing potential problems associated with leaving, I haven't found a compelling argument for extending our presence. If we were to ask the Iraqi people, a significant majority would likely say that we should leave within a year or even sooner. This raises questions about our motives and the true impact of our actions. If we were to follow the Iraqi people's wishes and leave, we could at least avoid being responsible for any further chaos and maintain a somewhat positive image in the region.",
            "Gender inequality remains a significant issue in the United States, and it's not solely limited to women. The level of difficulty in achieving equality varies depending on the field of work, with women often facing a \"glass ceiling\" in male-dominated industries. Women may possess the necessary qualifications for a job but are overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations and historical biases. Similarly, men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, face scrutiny and are often judged for not conforming to traditional masculine norms. \n\nIn the fashion industry, men may encounter skepticism because their interests and styles diverge from traditional male expectations. This can lead to a lack of understanding and respect from others. However, as women take on higher positions and become more accepted in the business world, and as men assume non-traditional roles, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nTo effectively address gender inequality, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. A gradual and subtle approach is necessary, as forcing change can lead to resistance. Progress has been made, and continued efforts are underway to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nInterestingly, individuals from different regions and backgrounds may also face discrimination, with people from rural areas or with non-standard grammar facing skepticism despite their intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of social biases and the need for ongoing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance across various dimensions, including gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making it a full-fledged crime, some places have decriminalized marijuana, which means it's no longer an offense that leads to arrest and imprisonment. Instead, it's treated more like a minor traffic infraction, resulting in a citation rather than a lengthy court process. However, even with decriminalization, individuals still worry about the potential consequences, such as difficulties during job interviews or other professional settings, which can be just as severe as having a full-fledged drug charge.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of decriminalization is that arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals can be extremely costly. This can be a significant burden for municipalities struggling financially. In fact, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana due to philosophical differences, even if it would free up resources for other essential services like public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nIn areas like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization can be beneficial, as it can lead to increased revenue for local governments. This additional funding can be used to support various community programs. However, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available, as it could lead to issues like public consumption and driving under the influence.\n\nWhile marijuana may not have the same immediate impairing effects as alcohol on motor skills, it can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. The effects of substances can vary greatly from person to person, and individual personalities play a significant role in how they react to substances. Some people can handle them with moderation, while others may not. This makes it challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana. Nonetheless, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with caution and understanding.",
            "I think I'd agree, but with reservations. On one hand, the traditional practices of the Catholic Church have been consistent over a long time, and it's beneficial to have roots in history. However, it's equally essential to be open to change. Many Catholics believe in attending church regularly, but this can sometimes lead to rigidity and exclusivity. I've observed that the Catholic Church can be quite strict and unforgiving towards those who don't adhere to its doctrine precisely or belong to other faiths. This is evident in instances where individuals from other denominations or with different backgrounds, like my parents who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, face difficulties being accepted or having their unions recognized.\n\nIt seems contradictory for the Catholic Church to preach love and acceptance of others while being intolerant towards those who don't conform. The church's teachings emphasize the importance of loving others, yet its practices often contradict this message. This disconnect is partly due to outdated traditions that the church adheres to despite their incongruence with the values it espouses.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's worth considering, but I'm unsure if it would necessarily lead to a reduction in instances of predatory behavior. Pedophilia is a complex issue, and I believe it's unlikely that allowing priests to be married would eliminate the problem. Those who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIn essence, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to prevent child abuse, as the underlying issues are more profound. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than seeking superficial solutions.",
            "I'm still undecided on this topic, and it's challenging to take a stance because it involves a fine line between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. Defining marriage can be a delicate matter that may offend certain groups, so I'm hesitant to make a decision. In my opinion, civil unions are a better alternative, as they focus on the union between two individuals rather than the idea of marriage as a sacrament. If we consider marriage a civil union, the government should not discriminate based on the couple's religious affiliation or background.\n\nIf all states can reach a consensus, it would be ideal to make it a federal law. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage, as it's a relatively minor issue that doesn't warrant such a drastic change. The constitution should not be amended lightly, especially for a cause that may not be widely supported.\n\nIn essence, I don't think banning gay marriage is significant enough to alter the constitution, and it's not a matter that should be elevated to that level.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household made me somewhat ambivalent about homosexuality, partly due to my close relationships with gay friends. While I may not fully agree with the lifestyle choice, I believe it should be legalized and allowed to be decided on a state-by-state basis rather than a national level. \n\nSince the US has a mix of Democratic and Republican states, each state's laws and attitudes on gay marriage will likely reflect their dominant party's stance. Therefore, if someone chooses to reside in a Democratic state that supports gay marriage, it's logical to respect their decision rather than trying to disagree with it. My stance is that homosexuals should have equal rights to heterosexuals, and it's up to individual states to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe former President Bush overstepped his bounds by trying to impose a nationwide ban on gay marriage. As he no longer holds office, his decision wouldn't apply to all states, and future presidents could potentially reverse it. I think decisions like these should be left to individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices rather than a single national leader imposing his will.",
            "The speaker argues that a post on a public platform like Myspace can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. They believe that if something is posted on the internet, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, as it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The speaker thinks that if officials use the internet to monitor student activity and prevent potential issues, such as substance abuse or violence, it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the speaker also believes that if officials are searching for students who have broken rules or engaged in misconduct, it's an invasion of privacy. They acknowledge that it's easier to express oneself when writing, and that the internet can make it difficult to keep personal thoughts and actions private. The speaker thinks that even if they're careful, something they've written or said online could come back to haunt them in the future.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that school officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and that this includes being proactive in preventing potential threats. They use the example of lockdown drills and emergency preparedness as a way to illustrate this point. In the context of the school shooting at Columbine, the speaker believes that officials were justified in monitoring student activity online to prevent a similar incident.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that if school officials use online monitoring to make the school a safer place, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, if they're simply trying to catch students who have broken rules, it's an overstep.",
            "At first, I strongly supported the war in response to the events of 9/11, which had a significant personal impact on me. However, I soon began to question our approach and the consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional aftermath of the tragedy led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term effects of our involvement in the conflict.\n\nUpon reflection, I think we entered the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to its backfiring on us. Our decision to intervene in the region without a well-thought-out strategy was misguided, and it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation. \n\nNow, I'm firmly against the war, and I don't think it achieved its intended goals. In my opinion, the ongoing conflict between various factions in the region means that they're not capable of posing a threat to us. Our presence there doesn't seem to be making a significant difference, and I've come to feel detached from the situation.\n\nI've come to view the people in the region as being more focused on internal strife than on building their country. I believe their approach to war is fundamentally different from ours, and it's driven by a desire to expel foreign forces rather than improve their situation. In light of this, I think it's time for us to leave and not get entangled in their conflicts.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11, rather than a thoughtful consideration of the consequences. The decision to go to war in Iraq was also influenced by President Bush's response to public sentiment. While I understand the emotional context, I believe we could have approached the situation more thoughtfully and planned our actions more carefully.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think we were the right people to try to change the dynamics in the region. Their problems run deeper, and I think they will always be prone to internal conflict. Our prolonged presence in the region is not making a significant difference, and I believe we're ultimately harming ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify continuing our involvement. I think it's time for us to withdraw our forces, as the situation is unlikely to improve as long as we're there. Our continued presence will only lead to further instability in the region, and it's not a sustainable solution."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to adapt its views to some extent in order to prevent a decline in its following. The Church's strong stance on certain issues, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, can be perceived as outdated by many people. If the Church were to adopt a more modern and accepting approach to these matters, it might be able to retain its followers. However, some individuals are already distancing themselves from the Church due to its views on these topics.\n\nIndividuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may not feel comfortable being part of a community that rejects these practices. Similarly, those who advocate for more flexible rules within the Church, such as allowing female priests or married priests, might also feel out of place. The Church's stance on these issues has led to a rift between its traditional views and the changing values of the general public.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have made a difference. The Catholic Church's emphasis on devotion to God does not necessarily preclude the idea of priests having a family life or other personal relationships. Like others, priests have personal aspects outside of their profession, and there is no reason why they cannot balance their devotion to God with their personal lives.",
            "In my opinion, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is not something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. It's unfair to deny the right to marry to two people of the same sex simply because of their sexual orientation. I don't think the government should interfere in this matter, as it's not a legal issue or a concern for national security. Rather, it's a matter of personal identity and individual rights. People are born with their orientation, and it's not something they can change. Therefore, I don't think it's right for the government to dictate who can or cannot get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the government should respect people's choices and identities, especially when it comes to their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be stigmatized or punished for being who they are. I believe the government should stay out of this issue, as it's not within their jurisdiction to make decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nIn short, I think gay marriage should be recognized and respected, and the government should not interfere with people's choices and identities. It's not a matter of choice but rather a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be judged or punished for it.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there are no valid reasons to deny it.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is entirely untrue. In fact, same-sex relationships have distinct characteristics that set them apart from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to consider them the same. Ultimately, they are like two sides of the same coin – each with their unique aspects.\n\nWhat's more, there are numerous civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits, which are currently denied to gay couples. For instance, a partner of a gay individual may not be allowed to visit them in the hospital or make medical decisions on their behalf, simply because they are not considered family. This is not only unfair but also illogical, especially when the couple has committed to spending their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of success and share the same factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. Therefore, it's clear that a same-sex relationship is essentially the same as any other.\n\nOne of the main issues people get hung up on is the differentiation between a civil union and a marriage certificate. However, if a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. The idea that some people can have a marriage certificate while others cannot is akin to segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children raised by gay parents. However, the same concerns can be applied to any family unit, regardless of their sexual orientation. In fact, research has shown that children of gay parents are not negatively affected by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nIn reality, the main issue is not the sexual orientation of parents but how society treats their children. Unfortunately, this often results in bullying, exclusion, and other social ills. As a society, we should strive to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all families.\n\nThe federal government should take an active role in making gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment should be abolished, as it is based on personal moral beliefs rather than the well-being of all citizens. It's essential to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose its own moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMoreover, some people's objections to gay marriage are based on outdated and debunked theories about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or personality defects. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and we should rely on credible research and institutions rather than popular opinion.\n\nUltimately, by accepting and recognizing the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more just and equitable society.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It's worth noting that simply because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. Although I don't think it should be readily available to the public, I do believe it could be used for medicinal purposes. This is because the fact that a substance is outlawed doesn't necessarily mean it's without benefits.\n\nThere are many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are used in pharmacies because they have medical benefits, despite being illegal. If we dismiss the advantages of marijuana solely because of its taboo status, I don't think that's a rational approach. Instead, I believe it's essential to acknowledge its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not accurate to compare marijuana to alcohol, as abusing marijuana can lead to negative consequences, similar to alcohol abuse. However, just as responsible consumption of alcohol is possible, I think it's plausible to integrate marijuana into society gradually, rather than making it completely legal at once. This gradual approach could help prevent abuse.\n\nThe stigma surrounding marijuana stems from its prohibited status, but this image is unjustified. Compared to highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine, marijuana is relatively harmless. If we can change this negative perception, people may be more likely to use it responsibly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict in its traditional ways. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed the atmosphere and dress code have evolved. When I was younger, I'd attend a private school and see my friends at church on weekends, and it was a more formal occasion. However, the church has introduced shorter masses, such as a 30-minute teenage mass, and people are now allowed to dress more casually, especially during the summer months. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere is noticeable, even in morning masses where people used to dress up.\n\nOne of the most striking changes is the casual wear, with people wearing jeans and khakis, which is a significant departure from the formal attire of the past. Although this may not be ideal for everyone, it's a reflection of the church's effort to become more approachable and inclusive.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or the church's policies. Research suggests that pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with this inclination. While it's essential to address and prevent abuse, I don't believe the church's stance on marriage or ordination would have made a difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nHowever, if the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue altogether, and the church's actions would be unacceptable. In general, I don't think the church's rules or policies are the primary cause of pedophilia; rather, it's a deeper issue that requires a more comprehensive approach to address and prevent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone changes to become more modern and inclusive, I don't think these changes would have prevented the recent scandals involving pedophilia. Ultimately, the church's response to these incidents will be crucial in rebuilding trust with their community.",
            "I initially had some reservations about the premise, but given the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, I think the invasion of Iraq was used as a pretext. The Bush administration inaccurately linked the war with Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. This misinformation still bothers me and, in my opinion, the Iraq war remains a contentious issue.\n\nWhat disturbs me even more is the Bush administration's apparent willingness to deceive the American people and their refusal to acknowledge these fabrications. Colin Powell, for instance, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. I find this behavior to be a serious breach of trust and, in my view, constitutes a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nI believe the Bush administration has disregarded the US Constitution since September 11th and has been trying to undermine it. It seems they entered office with the intention of going to war, and their motivations may have been driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy resources.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on for too long, withdrawing troops now may lead to further chaos, potentially resulting in civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution of enlisting regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the country may not be the best option either, as it could lead to long-term issues with Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government.\n\nThe current Parliament seems ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control over the political process. Radical elements continue to vie for power, causing friction within the government. In my opinion, the situation is complex and difficult to articulate without using strong language.",
            "I'm hesitant to discuss my views on the Iraq War.  I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to share my thoughts.  It seems that the war has become somewhat pointless, especially since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think our initial involvement was likely driven by a desire for revenge following the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not well-informed about the details of the war, but I do know that we're staying in Iraq to help establish democracy and gain access to their oil resources. However, this approach is causing widespread resentment and unrest. If we stay, we'll likely face a long-term commitment to establish democracy, which might be a futile endeavor. On the other hand, if we leave, Iraqis might feel betrayed and struggle to rebuild their country without our support.\n\nTo be frank, this topic is particularly challenging for me, as I'm not well-versed in the complexities of the Iraq War. However, I have some thoughts on the matter. While I initially thought the war should continue, I've come to realize that it's more about demonstrating American power and influence rather than a genuine attempt to achieve a lasting solution. The war's legacy, much like the Vietnam War, could be seen as an unnecessary and costly endeavor.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether the war should end or continue, as I'm aware of families who have lost loved ones in the conflict and I empathize with their struggles. However, staying in Iraq might be counterproductive, as it could lead to further cultural clashes and fuel anti-American sentiment. The potential for the war to escalate and create more problems seems high.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the Iraq War will likely be a long-term issue, with no clear resolution in sight. It's a complex and multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for a state to legitimize it, as it seems to be a matter for churches to decide. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, clearly implies that this should be left to individual churches rather than the government. By attempting to enforce laws or restrictions, the government would be contradicting the constitution's principles and undermining the concept of religious tolerance in the US. Furthermore, making an amendment on this issue would be counterproductive and restrictive, as it would be one of the few instances where the government would be limiting the people's freedoms rather than the other way around.\n\nI believe that the federal government and all local governments should refrain from getting involved in this matter, as it boils down to personal beliefs and preferences rather than a pressing societal issue. The push for an amendment seems to be driven by the president's personal Catholic views, indicating a bias towards a specific religion over others. Churches should be free to decide this issue without government interference, and there is no compelling reason to justify an amendment other than personal opinions. In fact, an amendment might have unforeseen benefits for the economy and society, potentially even boosting it in some way.\n\nIn summary, I have expressed my main points and strongly believe that the government should not interfere with the decision-making process of churches on this matter.",
            "The Iraq war raises several concerns about the honesty of the US government in their reasons for invading Iraq. Many believe that the administration manipulated public opinion by linking the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This emotional manipulation played on the public's outrage following the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to the invasion in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I agree that the Iraq war is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where similar mistakes were made. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but failed to prepare for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. This lack of preparedness has led to a long and difficult occupation, with a significant number of American casualties.\n\nIn retrospect, the US government should have learned from past experiences, such as the Vietnam War, where they attempted to impose democracy by removing a government and fighting insurgents. This approach is often challenging, especially when fighting a war against the local population rather than a traditional army. The US government should have considered all possible outcomes and prepared accordingly, but it appears that they were not adequately prepared for the situation in Iraq.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in the loss of many American lives, and the Iraqi people are still struggling to establish a stable government. The idea that the US government could impose democracy in Iraq quickly and easily is unrealistic, as it took years for democracy to take hold in the US. The government's portrayal of the conflict as a short and successful endeavor was misleading, and the reality is that it is a complex and difficult process.\n\nDeciding whether to continue the war is a difficult decision, as it is hard to abandon the people who have been affected by the conflict. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a difficult decision to justify. The real reasons for invading Iraq, such as access to oil and control over resources, also raise questions about the government's motives.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq war is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it is essential to critically evaluate the government's actions and decisions. The war has resulted in significant human and financial costs, and it is crucial to learn from past mistakes and consider all possible outcomes before embarking on such a significant undertaking. Ultimately, it is hoped that the conflict will end soon, and peace will be established in Iraq, but this may not be a likely outcome.",
            "Let's start by discussing my stance on gay marriage. I've always been a supporter of it, and I believe that it's a personal preference rather than something that can be dictated by societal norms or expectations. Recent studies suggest that there could be a biological component to a person's sexual orientation, rather than it being solely a product of their upbringing or environment. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't have a say in matters of marriage, as it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families on a private level. I've seen firsthand how gay couples in my neighborhood live their lives and function as any other family would, yet they're still denied the right to get married due to societal and legal restrictions. I find it absurd that some politicians, like President Bush, are attempting to redefine the meaning of marriage to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a chemical basis for a person's sexual orientation, which is not determined by their upbringing or life experiences. For instance, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father may not be more likely to be gay. This suggests that there's a biological component to sexual orientation that cannot be changed.\n\nThe issue of marriage should be a private matter, similar to how a straight couple can get married in a small, intimate ceremony without drawing attention to themselves. However, when two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle, as seen in the media coverage of high-profile gay weddings. I believe that marriage should be a personal, private decision that's not subject to public scrutiny or government approval.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge, and you have no control over who sees it. As an RA, I've experienced this firsthand. Once something is out there, it can color people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. Even if you think you're just joking, someone might take it seriously, and it could be misinterpreted. This is why the internet is a public forum – everyone can see it, including your friends on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook.\n\nFor instance, if someone overhears a concerning comment at school and reports it, the school officials will investigate, even if they have to look through the student's social media profiles to gather more information. This is not an invasion of privacy because the information was already publicly available online. However, the school should not be actively monitoring students' private conversations or social media without a valid reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with their students on social media or try to gather information about them in that way. This can blur the lines between their roles and create an uncomfortable situation. It's better to maintain a professional boundary.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want something to be public, don't post it online. You can't control how others will interpret your words, and you can't dictate what they take seriously or not. If concerns about a student's online behavior are brought to the school's attention, they have a responsibility to act, but they should do so in a way that respects students' privacy and maintains a professional relationship.",
            "The war has been ongoing for too long and has lost sight of its original purpose, which was to restore democracy to another country. Initially, the intention was to bring democracy to a nation without a fair political system, but it seems that personal motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, might have played a role. The true justification for the war has been compromised, and it appears that we're fighting solely to prove our military strength. \n\nI believe that the initial invasion made a significant statement, but the prolonged conflict has been unnecessary. If the goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for war. However, over time, the reasoning behind the war has become distorted and misconceived, with the primary objective now seeming to be an excuse to continue fighting. \n\nIt's time to bring the war to an end and let the local government take responsibility for its own affairs. The financial burden of the war, which has already drained billions of dollars from our economy, should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. These are problems that desperately require funding, and it's unacceptable that we're spending our resources on a war that has lost its original purpose. The lives of our citizens are being lost, and it's time for us to reevaluate our priorities and allocate our funds more effectively.",
            "The speaker is seeking clarification on a situation where a potentially life-saving action was taken after someone online discovered information about an individual. They argue that if you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to many people, even if it requires being friends with the person to view their profile on a site like Myspace. The speaker acknowledges that this raises concerns about privacy, but also believes that this was a positive outcome in this case.\n\nHowever, they also raise concerns about the potential for unfair treatment if authorities were to monitor students' online profiles without a clear reason. This could lead to discrimination against certain individuals. The speaker questions the appropriateness of having someone's job be to review students' online profiles.\n\nThe speaker also shares their personal experience with online safety, mentioning a TV show that demonstrated how easily personal information can be obtained from social media profiles. They express concerns about sharing information online, but also value the ability to communicate with friends through social media. They mention the difficulty of balancing online safety with the need to share information.\n\nThe speaker also brings up an instance where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which they found puzzling. They question the school's authority to dictate what students can and cannot do online, especially in relation to freedom of expression and privacy.",
            "It's difficult for me to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially since I was initially against it. However, the general consensus globally has shifted, and it's hard to deny that the majority of people now view the war as a bad idea. In fact, according to various polls, including those in the US, Iraq, and worldwide, a significant majority of the population – approximately 75-80% – think that the invasion was a mistake. Even a considerable number of US troops stationed in Iraq believe that the war was a poor decision and that the country should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation has been chaotic from the beginning, and it's challenging to find a solution that won't lead to further complications. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem insurmountable, and attempts to impose democracy on areas where it may not be suitable have been misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, the cost of invading Iraq was too high, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking such drastic action.\n\nI struggle to see a valid reason for the US to stay in Iraq beyond the initial invasion. Despite the administration's potential plans for a gradual withdrawal or addressing potential problems associated with leaving, I haven't found a compelling argument for extending our presence. If we were to ask the Iraqi people, a significant majority would likely say that we should leave within a year or even sooner. This raises questions about our motives and the true impact of our actions. If we were to follow the Iraqi people's wishes and leave, we could at least avoid being responsible for any further chaos and maintain a somewhat positive image in the region.",
            "Gender inequality remains a significant issue in the United States, and it's not solely limited to women. The level of difficulty in achieving equality varies depending on the field of work, with women often facing a \"glass ceiling\" in male-dominated industries. Women may possess the necessary qualifications for a job but are overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations and historical biases. Similarly, men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, face scrutiny and are often judged for not conforming to traditional masculine norms. \n\nIn the fashion industry, men may encounter skepticism because their interests and styles diverge from traditional male expectations. This can lead to a lack of understanding and respect from others. However, as women take on higher positions and become more accepted in the business world, and as men assume non-traditional roles, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nTo effectively address gender inequality, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. A gradual and subtle approach is necessary, as forcing change can lead to resistance. Progress has been made, and continued efforts are underway to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nInterestingly, individuals from different regions and backgrounds may also face discrimination, with people from rural areas or with non-standard grammar facing skepticism despite their intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of social biases and the need for ongoing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance across various dimensions, including gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making it a full-fledged crime, some places have decriminalized marijuana, which means it's no longer an offense that leads to arrest and imprisonment. Instead, it's treated more like a minor traffic infraction, resulting in a citation rather than a lengthy court process. However, even with decriminalization, individuals still worry about the potential consequences, such as difficulties during job interviews or other professional settings, which can be just as severe as having a full-fledged drug charge.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of decriminalization is that arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals can be extremely costly. This can be a significant burden for municipalities struggling financially. In fact, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana due to philosophical differences, even if it would free up resources for other essential services like public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nIn areas like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization can be beneficial, as it can lead to increased revenue for local governments. This additional funding can be used to support various community programs. However, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available, as it could lead to issues like public consumption and driving under the influence.\n\nWhile marijuana may not have the same immediate impairing effects as alcohol on motor skills, it can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. The effects of substances can vary greatly from person to person, and individual personalities play a significant role in how they react to substances. Some people can handle them with moderation, while others may not. This makes it challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana. Nonetheless, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with caution and understanding.",
            "I think I'd agree, but with reservations. On one hand, the traditional practices of the Catholic Church have been consistent over a long time, and it's beneficial to have roots in history. However, it's equally essential to be open to change. Many Catholics believe in attending church regularly, but this can sometimes lead to rigidity and exclusivity. I've observed that the Catholic Church can be quite strict and unforgiving towards those who don't adhere to its doctrine precisely or belong to other faiths. This is evident in instances where individuals from other denominations or with different backgrounds, like my parents who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, face difficulties being accepted or having their unions recognized.\n\nIt seems contradictory for the Catholic Church to preach love and acceptance of others while being intolerant towards those who don't conform. The church's teachings emphasize the importance of loving others, yet its practices often contradict this message. This disconnect is partly due to outdated traditions that the church adheres to despite their incongruence with the values it espouses.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's worth considering, but I'm unsure if it would necessarily lead to a reduction in instances of predatory behavior. Pedophilia is a complex issue, and I believe it's unlikely that allowing priests to be married would eliminate the problem. Those who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIn essence, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to prevent child abuse, as the underlying issues are more profound. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than seeking superficial solutions.",
            "I'm still undecided on this topic, and it's challenging to take a stance because it involves a fine line between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. Defining marriage can be a delicate matter that may offend certain groups, so I'm hesitant to make a decision. In my opinion, civil unions are a better alternative, as they focus on the union between two individuals rather than the idea of marriage as a sacrament. If we consider marriage a civil union, the government should not discriminate based on the couple's religious affiliation or background.\n\nIf all states can reach a consensus, it would be ideal to make it a federal law. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage, as it's a relatively minor issue that doesn't warrant such a drastic change. The constitution should not be amended lightly, especially for a cause that may not be widely supported.\n\nIn essence, I don't think banning gay marriage is significant enough to alter the constitution, and it's not a matter that should be elevated to that level.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household made me somewhat ambivalent about homosexuality, partly due to my close relationships with gay friends. While I may not fully agree with the lifestyle choice, I believe it should be legalized and allowed to be decided on a state-by-state basis rather than a national level. \n\nSince the US has a mix of Democratic and Republican states, each state's laws and attitudes on gay marriage will likely reflect their dominant party's stance. Therefore, if someone chooses to reside in a Democratic state that supports gay marriage, it's logical to respect their decision rather than trying to disagree with it. My stance is that homosexuals should have equal rights to heterosexuals, and it's up to individual states to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe former President Bush overstepped his bounds by trying to impose a nationwide ban on gay marriage. As he no longer holds office, his decision wouldn't apply to all states, and future presidents could potentially reverse it. I think decisions like these should be left to individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices rather than a single national leader imposing his will.",
            "The speaker argues that a post on a public platform like Myspace can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. They believe that if something is posted on the internet, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, as it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The speaker thinks that if officials use the internet to monitor student activity and prevent potential issues, such as substance abuse or violence, it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the speaker also believes that if officials are searching for students who have broken rules or engaged in misconduct, it's an invasion of privacy. They acknowledge that it's easier to express oneself when writing, and that the internet can make it difficult to keep personal thoughts and actions private. The speaker thinks that even if they're careful, something they've written or said online could come back to haunt them in the future.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that school officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and that this includes being proactive in preventing potential threats. They use the example of lockdown drills and emergency preparedness as a way to illustrate this point. In the context of the school shooting at Columbine, the speaker believes that officials were justified in monitoring student activity online to prevent a similar incident.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that if school officials use online monitoring to make the school a safer place, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, if they're simply trying to catch students who have broken rules, it's an overstep.",
            "At first, I strongly supported the war in response to the events of 9/11, which had a significant personal impact on me. However, I soon began to question our approach and the consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional aftermath of the tragedy led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term effects of our involvement in the conflict.\n\nUpon reflection, I think we entered the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to its backfiring on us. Our decision to intervene in the region without a well-thought-out strategy was misguided, and it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation. \n\nNow, I'm firmly against the war, and I don't think it achieved its intended goals. In my opinion, the ongoing conflict between various factions in the region means that they're not capable of posing a threat to us. Our presence there doesn't seem to be making a significant difference, and I've come to feel detached from the situation.\n\nI've come to view the people in the region as being more focused on internal strife than on building their country. I believe their approach to war is fundamentally different from ours, and it's driven by a desire to expel foreign forces rather than improve their situation. In light of this, I think it's time for us to leave and not get entangled in their conflicts.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11, rather than a thoughtful consideration of the consequences. The decision to go to war in Iraq was also influenced by President Bush's response to public sentiment. While I understand the emotional context, I believe we could have approached the situation more thoughtfully and planned our actions more carefully.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think we were the right people to try to change the dynamics in the region. Their problems run deeper, and I think they will always be prone to internal conflict. Our prolonged presence in the region is not making a significant difference, and I believe we're ultimately harming ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify continuing our involvement. I think it's time for us to withdraw our forces, as the situation is unlikely to improve as long as we're there. Our continued presence will only lead to further instability in the region, and it's not a sustainable solution."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to undergo some changes in certain aspects. The decline in followers is partly due to the Church's inflexibility regarding various issues. For instance, its views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are often perceived as outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern approach, it might be able to retain its followers. \n\nAs it stands, some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because its stance on these issues doesn't align with their own values. For individuals who believe in the right to abortion or support gay marriage, being part of a community where these practices are condemned can be uncomfortable. \n\nThe Church's stance against abortion and its disapproval of gay marriage might drive away those who hold different views. It's also worth considering the Church's stance on female priests and married priests. While some may argue that allowing priests to be married or having female priests could have prevented past issues, it's difficult to say for certain. \n\nThe Catholic Church views its priests as being married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, this is unlike any other profession, where individuals have a life outside of work. It seems unreasonable that priests cannot have a similar balance of work and personal life.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any personal objections to gay marriage. In my opinion, a person's sexual orientation is not something they can choose; it's a natural part of who they are. Therefore, I believe that gay individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to deny them the right to marry, just as it would be wrong to deny someone the right to marry because of their skin color or any other innate trait.\n\nI think the idea that someone's sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception. Just as we are born with certain physical and emotional characteristics, some people are naturally attracted to the same sex. It's not something they can change or control.\n\nI don't think it's the government's place to dictate who can and cannot get married, especially when it comes to something as personal as sexual orientation. This issue is not about national security, morality, or any other government concern; it's simply about allowing individuals to make their own choices about who they love and want to spend their lives with.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or punished for their natural orientation. It's essential to respect and accept people for who they are, rather than trying to change or control them.",
            "In my opinion, gay marriage should be legalized without any reservations. The main reason for this is that there is no valid argument against it. Some people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is misguided. The concept of same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. However, both types of relationships share many commonalities and should be treated with the same respect.\n\nOne of the primary concerns surrounding gay marriage is the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners, particularly in situations where one partner requires medical attention. Currently, same-sex partners are not considered family members and are often denied the right to visit their loved ones in hospitals or make important medical decisions. This is unfair, especially considering that many same-sex relationships can be just as fulfilling and enduring as opposite-sex relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as opposite-sex couples. They also face similar challenges and have the same desires for commitment and companionship.\n\nThe main issue at hand is not about religious objections to same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing the rights of same-sex couples in a legal context. Gay couples are not seeking to get married in a church, but rather to obtain a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is \"separate but unequal\" is particularly problematic. Denying same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is discriminatory and unjust. Many people worry about the impact of gay marriage on children and communities, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, research has shown that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as children raised by straight parents. Moreover, the main issue with adoption is not the sexual orientation of the adoptive parents, but rather the way society treats children with same-sex parents.\n\nIn some cases, children of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in schools, highlighting the need for greater understanding and acceptance. However, this does not mean that gay parents are inherently flawed or that their children are at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the federal government should take a proactive role in making gay marriage legal across all states. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is morally and ethically flawed, as it ignores the diversity of American culture and values. Rather than imposing a single, narrow perspective on the nation, our government should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all citizens.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to recognize that people's views on morality and gay rights vary greatly, and it's not fair to impose one group's beliefs on the rest of society. The American Psychological Association has already debunked the myth that being gay is a result of psychological damage or trauma, and it's time for people to listen to credible research and evidence rather than relying on unverified opinions and cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've come to realize that the fact a drug is prohibited doesn't necessarily mean it lacks potential benefits. While I believe it shouldn't be accessible to the general public, I think its therapeutic potential should be acknowledged. Many controlled substances used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are also considered illegal but are still utilized due to their benefits. Therefore, I think we should not dismiss the potential advantages of marijuana solely because of the stigma surrounding it. \n\nIt's worth noting that marijuana's potential for abuse is often compared to that of alcohol, which can also lead to negative consequences when misused. However, I don't think they're comparable in this context. Perhaps what we need is a gradual introduction of marijuana's use, allowing people to become more familiar with it and potentially use it responsibly. This would require a shift in public perception and the removal of the negative image associated with marijuana. By doing so, we can encourage its use for medicinal purposes while minimizing the risk of abuse. Many people have a misguided view of marijuana due to its current illicit status, but it's not as detrimental as other substances like heroin or cocaine. By changing this public perception, we can promote responsible use of marijuana for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the changing times of the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. When I was younger, I would regularly attend church on Sundays, dressing up in matching outfits with my friends from a private school. However, the church has since introduced shorter masses, often lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer when beachwear is common. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere has become more noticeable, even in morning masses where I used to dress up. \n\nRegarding the recent scandals surrounding Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are still men who, despite being married or unmarried, have a predilection for children. It's not necessarily the institution of marriage or celibacy that contributes to this issue, but rather the individual's inherent nature. Some other faiths permit married clergy, yet cases of pedophilia still occur, suggesting that personal choices and genetics play a significant role.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientations and tendencies may be determined by genetics, and cannot be changed by external factors, such as upbringings or institutions. This means that the church's rules about marriage and celibacy might not be the primary cause of these issues. If the church was aware of and tried to conceal these incidents, that's a different matter altogether, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules had a significant impact on the prevalence of pedophilia among its clergy.",
            "The speaker initially found the idea acceptable but felt that the timing of the Iraq invasion was problematic, coming as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks. They believe the Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, despite the claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This deception, particularly Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, has left a lasting negative impression on the speaker. They view the administration's actions as a disregard for the Constitution and an attempt to marginalize it.\n\nThe speaker also suggests that the Bush administration had a predetermined desire for war, with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from a perceived slight against his father and a desire to expand the US energy supply. They feel that the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more bloodshed.\n\nThe proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order in Iraq is seen as problematic, as it may infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty and lead to long-term issues with the interim government's effectiveness. The speaker expresses skepticism about the ability of the current Parliament to function and notes the influence of radical elements in the political process, which could lead to further instability.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, viewing their actions as a betrayal of the public trust and a disregard for the Constitution. They are uncertain about the best course of action, recognizing that any decision will likely have far-reaching consequences.",
            "The conversation revolves around the speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, they express confusion about the war, stating that it wasn't formally declared by Congress, which they believe is a requirement for a war to be considered a legitimate one. They also mention that the war was likely a response to the 9/11 attacks, and that the primary goals are to establish democracy and secure access to oil resources.\n\nHowever, the speaker feels that these objectives are not justified, as the war has caused widespread suffering and upset. They mention that staying in Iraq would lead to a lengthy and difficult process of building democracy, which is unlikely to succeed. If the US were to withdraw, Iraqis might be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, potentially leading to further resentment towards the US.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears, suggesting that the war should continue because it wouldn't be fair to pull out now. They argue that the conflict is not a \"war\" in the classical sense, but rather a demonstration of US military power. They also express sympathy for President Bush, who they believe is being unfairly criticized for the war's outcome.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the complexity of the situation, with the speaker acknowledging the importance of considering the human cost of the conflict, particularly for families with loved ones serving in Iraq. However, they also worry that US involvement is exacerbating the situation and creating further divisions within Iraqi society. They fear that attempting to impose American values and democracy on Iraq could ultimately lead to more harm and create an even stronger sense of anti-American sentiment.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the conflict will likely drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly disagree with the idea of making it a law or allowing the state to declare it as legal, as I believe it's a matter that should be left to the discretion of churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which is crucial for maintaining religious tolerance in the United States. Attempting to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing for its illegality are unfairly imposing their own church's beliefs on others, as many Christians and Catholics oppose it. Instead, the government should respect the autonomy of churches to decide what is and isn't acceptable. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for diverse religious practices and beliefs.\n\nMaking an amendment to address this issue would be misguided and contradictory to the constitution's existing principles. Moreover, it would be one of the rare instances where the government would be restricting the people rather than itself. I believe it's not the government's place to intervene in this matter, especially when their motivations seem to be driven by personal biases rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nThe president's push for this amendment appears to be rooted in his personal Catholic beliefs, which would unfairly favor one religion over others. There's no substantial reason to support an amendment that would restrict the freedom of churches, as it wouldn't have a significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society by allowing religious tolerance to flourish.\n\nOverall, I believe the decision should be left to the churches, and the government should refrain from imposing its will on this issue.",
            "The Iraq War was a complex and contentious issue. From the outset, there were concerns that the US government was not entirely transparent about the reasons for the invasion. It seemed that the government attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to manipulate public emotions, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, were against it, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.\n\nIn some ways, the Iraq War resembled the Vietnam War, where the US government attempted to impose a democratic government on a foreign nation. However, history had shown that such efforts often led to a long and challenging process, with significant loss of life and difficulty in establishing stability. The US government seemed unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, including the power vacuum and ensuing chaos.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was seen as a way to establish democracy, similar to the US government's goals in Vietnam. However, the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of winning the hearts and minds of the local population were grossly underestimated. The presence of insurgents and the need to fight against a civilian population made the conflict much harder to win.\n\nThe speaker believes that the US government should not have entered the war without proper planning for various outcomes. The aftermath of the invasion was not given sufficient consideration, and the country is still struggling with instability and violence nearly a decade later. Many American soldiers have lost their lives in the conflict, and the training of Iraqi security forces has been a slow and arduous process.\n\nThe speaker questions the true motives behind the invasion, suggesting that the US government may have been driven by self-interest, particularly the desire to control Iraq's oil resources. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as well as the government's willingness to tolerate similar threats from other nations (such as North Korea), has led to suspicions of deception and a lack of thoroughness in decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the speaker hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict, but is uncertain if this will come to pass.",
            "For me, the issue of gay marriage is quite clear-cut – I've always been in favor of it. I think it's a matter of personal preference, and research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological basis rather than being determined by societal factors. It would be inhumane to deny individuals rights based on something beyond their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government and politics should not interfere with this personal choice.\n\nIn fact, this issue is not even a matter of state or national politics; it's a personal matter that affects individuals and their families. In my own neighborhood, I've seen several openly gay couples who lead their lives just like any other family, contributing to their community in the same way. However, they are unable to get married due to laws that prevent them from doing so. I find it absurd that politicians, like President Bush, attempt to redefine the concept of marriage according to their own interpretations.\n\nRecent studies suggest that homosexuality may be influenced by a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than by upbringing or environmental factors. For instance, a person might be predisposed to being homosexual regardless of whether they have siblings or a father figure. This highlights the biological aspect of sexual orientation, rather than any sociological influence.\n\nFrom my perspective, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a public or federal issue. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention to themselves, but if a gay couple wants to get married, it becomes a national news story. This disparity is unacceptable, and I believe that marriage should be treated as a personal, private matter, rather than a public concern.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public information that anyone can access, including your school. As a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand how this can lead to issues. Posts about violence or threats can lead people to have a negative opinion of you, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they might share your content with others, including school officials.\n\nIn the case that occurred at my school, a student overheard someone mentioning something concerning and reported it to the authorities. When they investigated, they found concerning content on the student's social media profiles that could have been taken as a joke in a different context. This highlights the importance of being mindful of what you share online, as there's no expectation of privacy once it's out there.\n\nIf you don't want people to see something, don't post it online. You can't control what others think or how they react to your content. While I don't think it's right for school officials to be friends with students on social media and monitoring their online activity, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.\n\nIn fact, I think it's a good idea for teachers and RAs to maintain a professional boundary with their students by not creating fake social media accounts or friending them on those platforms. If you're in a position of authority, it's best to avoid being connected to your students' personal lives, as it can create unnecessary complications and responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, the internet is a public forum, and what you post can have real-world consequences. Be careful about what you share online, and be aware of the potential impact it can have on your relationships and reputation.",
            "The conflict has dragged on for an unnecessarily long period. While the initial objective of establishing democracy in another nation was commendable, it appears that this goal has been lost sight of over time. The war seems to have become a means to assert global dominance rather than a genuine attempt to bring about positive change. The motivations behind the war, particularly considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, are also questionable.\n\nIn my opinion, if the primary intention was to introduce democracy to a country with an unfair system, then that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal agendas played a significant role, it would be unfair. It's clear that the war's purpose has been distorted over time, and the conflict has become a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nI believe that the initial stages of the war served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged duration has been excessive. We've been pouring billions of dollars into the conflict, diverting funds away from pressing domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's crucial that we reassess our priorities and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nThe war has already lasted for an extended period, and it's time for the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. We should withdraw our support and redirect the funds to address our own internal problems. The financial burden of this conflict is substantial, and it's essential that we utilize our resources more effectively, focusing on pressing domestic issues rather than propping up a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "The person would like to clarify that they don't think it's an invasion of privacy if someone finds information online. They argue that when you post content on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone, as seen on platforms like Myspace where profiles are only visible to friends. By adding someone as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to view your profile. Therefore, individuals should be aware that a significant number of people may see the information they post online.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes more complex when considering how to balance individual freedom with the potential consequences. While it's not feasible for one person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent harm, it could be seen as unfair to single out certain individuals for scrutiny. The situation also raises questions about the role of social media monitoring in schools and whether it's appropriate for authorities to restrict students' access to platforms like Myspace.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experience with Facebook and concerns about online safety. They mention a disturbing example of someone using a social media platform to gather information about a person and manipulate them into meeting. This highlights the potential risks of sharing personal details online, making it challenging to strike a balance between maintaining online presence and protecting one's anonymity.\n\nThe speaker also brings up a story about their roommate's high school, where students were banned from using Myspace. They question the authority of school officials to restrict students' online activities, suggesting that this may have been an overreach regarding individual privacy. The speaker concludes by expressing uncertainty about the school's right to dictate what online platforms students can use.",
            "Reflecting on the Iraq War, I'm hesitant to share my views due to the common criticism of jumping on the bandwagon of those who opposed it from the start. However, I did express my opposition initially, and it's not a pressing concern anymore now that the general consensus worldwide has solidified that the war was ill-conceived, except within the administration, which struggles to acknowledge their mistakes.\n\nA global survey of public opinion reveals a stark reality: a significant majority, ranging from 75% to 80%, across the world, the US, and Iraq, believe the war was a poor decision. Even US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, think it was a misguided effort and advocate for a speedy withdrawal within a year. This widespread opposition underscores the war's disastrous consequences from the outset, which have continued to escalate since the US involvement.\n\nThe issue boils down to a profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations, which previous administrations have struggled to bridge. The notion that the US can impose democracy on a region that has its own unique values and preferences is misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a malevolent leader, the decision to invade Iraq wasn't taken lightly, and the costs have been devastating.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq remains dire, it's challenging to justify continued US presence. While the administration might propose potential benefits of staying, I haven't been convinced by their arguments. If anything, a gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer wouldn't be unreasonable. In fact, the majority of Iraqis, approximately 80%, believe the US should leave within a year, and a significant segment, at least 25%, advocate for an immediate withdrawal.\n\nConsidering that the very people the US is trying to help are urging them to leave, it's worth taking their opinions seriously. If the US were to ask for their input and they requested withdrawal, it would absolve the US of responsibility if things were to deteriorate further. If the US were to decide to assist Iraq after that, it would at least be seen as a more benevolent action than the current situation. Although, it's unlikely the US will ever be viewed as a benevolent force in the Middle East, this course of action would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While it's true that the United States has made progress in addressing gender discrimination, I still believe it's a significant issue that affects various aspects of society. The problem isn't limited to women, as men also face challenges, particularly in industries where traditional gender roles are prevalent. For instance, in the corporate world, women often struggle to advance to senior positions due to the \"glass ceiling,\" despite their qualifications, because of societal expectations and outdated stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often face criticism and judgment from others, who view it as unusual for men to be primary caregivers. This can be particularly challenging for stay-at-home dads who may have always envisioned themselves in this role. The fashion industry is another area where men are often stereotyped and may not be taken seriously if they're interested in fashion.\n\nHowever, it's heartening to see that there are positive changes taking place. As more women break into leadership positions and become CEOs, they're helping to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes. Moreover, stay-at-home dads are becoming increasingly accepted as primary caregivers, and men in the fashion industry are being taken more seriously. But changing societal attitudes takes time, and it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals in non-traditional roles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other forms of discrimination, such as socioeconomic background and geographical location, can also affect individuals, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area with limited educational opportunities may face prejudice from others in the corporate world, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Ultimately, addressing these complex issues requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the various factors at play and promotes understanding, acceptance, and equality.",
            "It seems that decriminalizing marijuana has reduced its classification from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction similar to a traffic ticket, eliminating the need for arrest and detention. However, this change does not entirely eliminate the potential consequences of being caught, such as affecting job prospects and future opportunities. Although proponents argue that decriminalization can help reduce costs associated with prosecution, law enforcement, and the judicial system, some municipalities may be hesitant to adopt this approach due to philosophical or financial concerns.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there is a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization has led to a significant increase in revenue that can be allocated towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and support for the homeless. On the other hand, some people worry that full legalization could lead to a similar situation as cigarette sales, with marijuana being freely available and potentially contributing to impaired driving and societal disapproval.\n\nIt's worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. However, individuals react differently to substances, and some may be more prone to overindulgence than others. While it's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, it's clear that it can have significant impacts on people's lives, particularly when used excessively. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana use depends on various factors, including the individual's personality and behavior.",
            "I would say that the Catholic Church has a mix of traditional practices and a need to adapt to change. While it's beneficial to draw from its rich history, it's also essential to be flexible and open to new ideas. However, the Church's stance on certain issues seems contradictory. On one hand, it emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching. On the other hand, it often appears to be intolerant of those who don't adhere to its doctrine or come from different faiths.\n\nFor instance, my own family experienced this intolerance firsthand when my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's non-Catholic background. This behavior is hypocritical, as it contradicts the Church's message of acceptance and love.\n\nAdditionally, some Catholic teachings seem to be outdated and don't align with the values they promote. Despite this, the Church continues to stick to these practices. I personally believe that allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, but I'm not convinced that it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilia is a complex issue that likely stems from more than just marital status, and those who would engage in such behavior are unlikely to be deterred by marriage.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that child abuse can happen regardless of whether a priest is married or not. The root of the issue is not the priest's marital status but rather the underlying behavior and circumstances. Therefore, allowing priests to marry is unlikely to be a solution to this problem.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and I don't think I can take a stance on whether one side is right or wrong. This topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage, which can be a sensitive subject. \n\nIt's difficult to approach this without potentially offending someone, and the concept of marriage is quite complex. I'm not convinced that the government should be involved in defining what constitutes a marriage, especially considering it's often considered a sacrament. If two people are married, they should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs, and shouldn't be subject to different tax benefits or government recognition based on their baptism. \n\nIn theory, marriage should be viewed as a civil union between two consenting adults, rather than something that's defined by the government or a specific church. The concept of gay marriage, in this context, is essentially the same as a civil union between two people. \n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it would be logical to push for federal recognition of this. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage. This issue doesn't have the significance or the broad support needed to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a matter of constitutional importance, and the constitution should not be altered to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to some ambivalence towards homosexuality. However, having close friendships with gay individuals has made me more understanding, even if I don't fully agree with their lifestyle choices. While I don't think it should be a national issue, I believe each state should have the autonomy to decide on the legalization of gay marriage, rather than the federal government imposing a single decision. This approach reflects the diverse nature of the United States, where both Democratic and Republican states have varying views on the matter. If someone chooses to live in a state that has legalized gay marriage, they should respect the local decision, as it is a choice they made. In my opinion, homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, and the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. Furthermore, as President Bush's ban on gay marriage is a national decision, it's unreasonable for him to impose his views on every state, considering he doesn't live in every state and will be out of office soon. Ultimately, decisions like this should be left to the states, as they will be directly affected by the outcome, not the president.",
            "I don't think Myspace should be considered a private space, given that it's a public platform. When you post something online, you have to expect that others, including school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. In the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe it's perfectly reasonable for school officials to monitor online activity if it makes the school a safer place.\n\nWhile I understand concerns about privacy, if monitoring online activity leads to the prevention of a school shooting or makes the school a better and safer environment, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, schools often take measures to ensure student safety, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness, which can be related to preventing incidents like school shootings.\n\nIt's true that anything posted online can be accessed and potentially used against someone in the future, but this doesn't necessarily make it an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safe school environment. School officials may monitor online activity to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, but this can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent harm and create a safer school environment.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between monitoring online activity and respecting students' privacy. If school officials have evidence that leads to a specific concern, such as a student engaging in prohibited behavior, it's reasonable for them to investigate further. However, randomly searching through students' online activity without cause can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and monitoring online activity can be a means to achieve this goal. However, it's essential to do so in a manner that respects students' rights to privacy and doesn't unfairly target individuals.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure school environment, not to unfairly target students or invade their privacy.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of the war due to my personal connection to 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation, I believe that the emotional response at the time led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term consequences. As a result, we entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately led to negative outcomes. I now strongly oppose the war and do not think it achieved its intended goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in the affected region are currently preoccupied with internal conflicts and are unable to focus on fighting against external threats. Therefore, our presence in the area is unlikely to have a significant impact on the situation. Unfortunately, my experiences with the aftermath of 9/11 have led me to become desensitized to the situation in the region, and I struggle to muster concern for their plight.\n\nI believe that the concept of war differs significantly between us and the people in the region, with their approach being more brutal and less focused on nation-building. I think they are mainly driven by a desire to expel foreign forces, and I am open to the idea of withdrawing our troops.\n\nIn hindsight, I think our decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. President Bush made a decision to declare war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations at the time, I believe we could have approached the situation with more caution and a clearer plan.\n\nI think it's unlikely that we can fundamentally change the people in the region, as their culture and ways of life are deeply ingrained. Our presence has not brought about significant progress, and I believe it's counterproductive to continue our involvement. In fact, I think it's only a matter of time before the situation collapses once we leave, and we risk harming ourselves by prolonging our stay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to undergo some changes in certain aspects. The decline in followers is partly due to the Church's inflexibility regarding various issues. For instance, its views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are often perceived as outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern approach, it might be able to retain its followers. \n\nAs it stands, some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because its stance on these issues doesn't align with their own values. For individuals who believe in the right to abortion or support gay marriage, being part of a community where these practices are condemned can be uncomfortable. \n\nThe Church's stance against abortion and its disapproval of gay marriage might drive away those who hold different views. It's also worth considering the Church's stance on female priests and married priests. While some may argue that allowing priests to be married or having female priests could have prevented past issues, it's difficult to say for certain. \n\nThe Catholic Church views its priests as being married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, this is unlike any other profession, where individuals have a life outside of work. It seems unreasonable that priests cannot have a similar balance of work and personal life.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any personal objections to gay marriage. In my opinion, a person's sexual orientation is not something they can choose; it's a natural part of who they are. Therefore, I believe that gay individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to deny them the right to marry, just as it would be wrong to deny someone the right to marry because of their skin color or any other innate trait.\n\nI think the idea that someone's sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception. Just as we are born with certain physical and emotional characteristics, some people are naturally attracted to the same sex. It's not something they can change or control.\n\nI don't think it's the government's place to dictate who can and cannot get married, especially when it comes to something as personal as sexual orientation. This issue is not about national security, morality, or any other government concern; it's simply about allowing individuals to make their own choices about who they love and want to spend their lives with.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or punished for their natural orientation. It's essential to respect and accept people for who they are, rather than trying to change or control them.",
            "In my opinion, gay marriage should be legalized without any reservations. The main reason for this is that there is no valid argument against it. Some people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is misguided. The concept of same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. However, both types of relationships share many commonalities and should be treated with the same respect.\n\nOne of the primary concerns surrounding gay marriage is the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners, particularly in situations where one partner requires medical attention. Currently, same-sex partners are not considered family members and are often denied the right to visit their loved ones in hospitals or make important medical decisions. This is unfair, especially considering that many same-sex relationships can be just as fulfilling and enduring as opposite-sex relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as opposite-sex couples. They also face similar challenges and have the same desires for commitment and companionship.\n\nThe main issue at hand is not about religious objections to same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing the rights of same-sex couples in a legal context. Gay couples are not seeking to get married in a church, but rather to obtain a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is \"separate but unequal\" is particularly problematic. Denying same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is discriminatory and unjust. Many people worry about the impact of gay marriage on children and communities, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, research has shown that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as children raised by straight parents. Moreover, the main issue with adoption is not the sexual orientation of the adoptive parents, but rather the way society treats children with same-sex parents.\n\nIn some cases, children of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in schools, highlighting the need for greater understanding and acceptance. However, this does not mean that gay parents are inherently flawed or that their children are at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the federal government should take a proactive role in making gay marriage legal across all states. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is morally and ethically flawed, as it ignores the diversity of American culture and values. Rather than imposing a single, narrow perspective on the nation, our government should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all citizens.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to recognize that people's views on morality and gay rights vary greatly, and it's not fair to impose one group's beliefs on the rest of society. The American Psychological Association has already debunked the myth that being gay is a result of psychological damage or trauma, and it's time for people to listen to credible research and evidence rather than relying on unverified opinions and cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've come to realize that the fact a drug is prohibited doesn't necessarily mean it lacks potential benefits. While I believe it shouldn't be accessible to the general public, I think its therapeutic potential should be acknowledged. Many controlled substances used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are also considered illegal but are still utilized due to their benefits. Therefore, I think we should not dismiss the potential advantages of marijuana solely because of the stigma surrounding it. \n\nIt's worth noting that marijuana's potential for abuse is often compared to that of alcohol, which can also lead to negative consequences when misused. However, I don't think they're comparable in this context. Perhaps what we need is a gradual introduction of marijuana's use, allowing people to become more familiar with it and potentially use it responsibly. This would require a shift in public perception and the removal of the negative image associated with marijuana. By doing so, we can encourage its use for medicinal purposes while minimizing the risk of abuse. Many people have a misguided view of marijuana due to its current illicit status, but it's not as detrimental as other substances like heroin or cocaine. By changing this public perception, we can promote responsible use of marijuana for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the changing times of the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. When I was younger, I would regularly attend church on Sundays, dressing up in matching outfits with my friends from a private school. However, the church has since introduced shorter masses, often lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer when beachwear is common. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere has become more noticeable, even in morning masses where I used to dress up. \n\nRegarding the recent scandals surrounding Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are still men who, despite being married or unmarried, have a predilection for children. It's not necessarily the institution of marriage or celibacy that contributes to this issue, but rather the individual's inherent nature. Some other faiths permit married clergy, yet cases of pedophilia still occur, suggesting that personal choices and genetics play a significant role.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientations and tendencies may be determined by genetics, and cannot be changed by external factors, such as upbringings or institutions. This means that the church's rules about marriage and celibacy might not be the primary cause of these issues. If the church was aware of and tried to conceal these incidents, that's a different matter altogether, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules had a significant impact on the prevalence of pedophilia among its clergy.",
            "The speaker initially found the idea acceptable but felt that the timing of the Iraq invasion was problematic, coming as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks. They believe the Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, despite the claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This deception, particularly Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, has left a lasting negative impression on the speaker. They view the administration's actions as a disregard for the Constitution and an attempt to marginalize it.\n\nThe speaker also suggests that the Bush administration had a predetermined desire for war, with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from a perceived slight against his father and a desire to expand the US energy supply. They feel that the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more bloodshed.\n\nThe proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order in Iraq is seen as problematic, as it may infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty and lead to long-term issues with the interim government's effectiveness. The speaker expresses skepticism about the ability of the current Parliament to function and notes the influence of radical elements in the political process, which could lead to further instability.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, viewing their actions as a betrayal of the public trust and a disregard for the Constitution. They are uncertain about the best course of action, recognizing that any decision will likely have far-reaching consequences.",
            "The conversation revolves around the speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, they express confusion about the war, stating that it wasn't formally declared by Congress, which they believe is a requirement for a war to be considered a legitimate one. They also mention that the war was likely a response to the 9/11 attacks, and that the primary goals are to establish democracy and secure access to oil resources.\n\nHowever, the speaker feels that these objectives are not justified, as the war has caused widespread suffering and upset. They mention that staying in Iraq would lead to a lengthy and difficult process of building democracy, which is unlikely to succeed. If the US were to withdraw, Iraqis might be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, potentially leading to further resentment towards the US.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears, suggesting that the war should continue because it wouldn't be fair to pull out now. They argue that the conflict is not a \"war\" in the classical sense, but rather a demonstration of US military power. They also express sympathy for President Bush, who they believe is being unfairly criticized for the war's outcome.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the complexity of the situation, with the speaker acknowledging the importance of considering the human cost of the conflict, particularly for families with loved ones serving in Iraq. However, they also worry that US involvement is exacerbating the situation and creating further divisions within Iraqi society. They fear that attempting to impose American values and democracy on Iraq could ultimately lead to more harm and create an even stronger sense of anti-American sentiment.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the conflict will likely drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly disagree with the idea of making it a law or allowing the state to declare it as legal, as I believe it's a matter that should be left to the discretion of churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which is crucial for maintaining religious tolerance in the United States. Attempting to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing for its illegality are unfairly imposing their own church's beliefs on others, as many Christians and Catholics oppose it. Instead, the government should respect the autonomy of churches to decide what is and isn't acceptable. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for diverse religious practices and beliefs.\n\nMaking an amendment to address this issue would be misguided and contradictory to the constitution's existing principles. Moreover, it would be one of the rare instances where the government would be restricting the people rather than itself. I believe it's not the government's place to intervene in this matter, especially when their motivations seem to be driven by personal biases rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nThe president's push for this amendment appears to be rooted in his personal Catholic beliefs, which would unfairly favor one religion over others. There's no substantial reason to support an amendment that would restrict the freedom of churches, as it wouldn't have a significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society by allowing religious tolerance to flourish.\n\nOverall, I believe the decision should be left to the churches, and the government should refrain from imposing its will on this issue.",
            "The Iraq War was a complex and contentious issue. From the outset, there were concerns that the US government was not entirely transparent about the reasons for the invasion. It seemed that the government attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to manipulate public emotions, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, were against it, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.\n\nIn some ways, the Iraq War resembled the Vietnam War, where the US government attempted to impose a democratic government on a foreign nation. However, history had shown that such efforts often led to a long and challenging process, with significant loss of life and difficulty in establishing stability. The US government seemed unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, including the power vacuum and ensuing chaos.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was seen as a way to establish democracy, similar to the US government's goals in Vietnam. However, the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of winning the hearts and minds of the local population were grossly underestimated. The presence of insurgents and the need to fight against a civilian population made the conflict much harder to win.\n\nThe speaker believes that the US government should not have entered the war without proper planning for various outcomes. The aftermath of the invasion was not given sufficient consideration, and the country is still struggling with instability and violence nearly a decade later. Many American soldiers have lost their lives in the conflict, and the training of Iraqi security forces has been a slow and arduous process.\n\nThe speaker questions the true motives behind the invasion, suggesting that the US government may have been driven by self-interest, particularly the desire to control Iraq's oil resources. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as well as the government's willingness to tolerate similar threats from other nations (such as North Korea), has led to suspicions of deception and a lack of thoroughness in decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the speaker hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict, but is uncertain if this will come to pass.",
            "For me, the issue of gay marriage is quite clear-cut – I've always been in favor of it. I think it's a matter of personal preference, and research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological basis rather than being determined by societal factors. It would be inhumane to deny individuals rights based on something beyond their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government and politics should not interfere with this personal choice.\n\nIn fact, this issue is not even a matter of state or national politics; it's a personal matter that affects individuals and their families. In my own neighborhood, I've seen several openly gay couples who lead their lives just like any other family, contributing to their community in the same way. However, they are unable to get married due to laws that prevent them from doing so. I find it absurd that politicians, like President Bush, attempt to redefine the concept of marriage according to their own interpretations.\n\nRecent studies suggest that homosexuality may be influenced by a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than by upbringing or environmental factors. For instance, a person might be predisposed to being homosexual regardless of whether they have siblings or a father figure. This highlights the biological aspect of sexual orientation, rather than any sociological influence.\n\nFrom my perspective, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a public or federal issue. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention to themselves, but if a gay couple wants to get married, it becomes a national news story. This disparity is unacceptable, and I believe that marriage should be treated as a personal, private matter, rather than a public concern.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public information that anyone can access, including your school. As a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand how this can lead to issues. Posts about violence or threats can lead people to have a negative opinion of you, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they might share your content with others, including school officials.\n\nIn the case that occurred at my school, a student overheard someone mentioning something concerning and reported it to the authorities. When they investigated, they found concerning content on the student's social media profiles that could have been taken as a joke in a different context. This highlights the importance of being mindful of what you share online, as there's no expectation of privacy once it's out there.\n\nIf you don't want people to see something, don't post it online. You can't control what others think or how they react to your content. While I don't think it's right for school officials to be friends with students on social media and monitoring their online activity, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.\n\nIn fact, I think it's a good idea for teachers and RAs to maintain a professional boundary with their students by not creating fake social media accounts or friending them on those platforms. If you're in a position of authority, it's best to avoid being connected to your students' personal lives, as it can create unnecessary complications and responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, the internet is a public forum, and what you post can have real-world consequences. Be careful about what you share online, and be aware of the potential impact it can have on your relationships and reputation.",
            "The conflict has dragged on for an unnecessarily long period. While the initial objective of establishing democracy in another nation was commendable, it appears that this goal has been lost sight of over time. The war seems to have become a means to assert global dominance rather than a genuine attempt to bring about positive change. The motivations behind the war, particularly considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, are also questionable.\n\nIn my opinion, if the primary intention was to introduce democracy to a country with an unfair system, then that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal agendas played a significant role, it would be unfair. It's clear that the war's purpose has been distorted over time, and the conflict has become a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nI believe that the initial stages of the war served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged duration has been excessive. We've been pouring billions of dollars into the conflict, diverting funds away from pressing domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's crucial that we reassess our priorities and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nThe war has already lasted for an extended period, and it's time for the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. We should withdraw our support and redirect the funds to address our own internal problems. The financial burden of this conflict is substantial, and it's essential that we utilize our resources more effectively, focusing on pressing domestic issues rather than propping up a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "The person would like to clarify that they don't think it's an invasion of privacy if someone finds information online. They argue that when you post content on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone, as seen on platforms like Myspace where profiles are only visible to friends. By adding someone as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to view your profile. Therefore, individuals should be aware that a significant number of people may see the information they post online.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes more complex when considering how to balance individual freedom with the potential consequences. While it's not feasible for one person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent harm, it could be seen as unfair to single out certain individuals for scrutiny. The situation also raises questions about the role of social media monitoring in schools and whether it's appropriate for authorities to restrict students' access to platforms like Myspace.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experience with Facebook and concerns about online safety. They mention a disturbing example of someone using a social media platform to gather information about a person and manipulate them into meeting. This highlights the potential risks of sharing personal details online, making it challenging to strike a balance between maintaining online presence and protecting one's anonymity.\n\nThe speaker also brings up a story about their roommate's high school, where students were banned from using Myspace. They question the authority of school officials to restrict students' online activities, suggesting that this may have been an overreach regarding individual privacy. The speaker concludes by expressing uncertainty about the school's right to dictate what online platforms students can use.",
            "Reflecting on the Iraq War, I'm hesitant to share my views due to the common criticism of jumping on the bandwagon of those who opposed it from the start. However, I did express my opposition initially, and it's not a pressing concern anymore now that the general consensus worldwide has solidified that the war was ill-conceived, except within the administration, which struggles to acknowledge their mistakes.\n\nA global survey of public opinion reveals a stark reality: a significant majority, ranging from 75% to 80%, across the world, the US, and Iraq, believe the war was a poor decision. Even US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, think it was a misguided effort and advocate for a speedy withdrawal within a year. This widespread opposition underscores the war's disastrous consequences from the outset, which have continued to escalate since the US involvement.\n\nThe issue boils down to a profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations, which previous administrations have struggled to bridge. The notion that the US can impose democracy on a region that has its own unique values and preferences is misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a malevolent leader, the decision to invade Iraq wasn't taken lightly, and the costs have been devastating.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq remains dire, it's challenging to justify continued US presence. While the administration might propose potential benefits of staying, I haven't been convinced by their arguments. If anything, a gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer wouldn't be unreasonable. In fact, the majority of Iraqis, approximately 80%, believe the US should leave within a year, and a significant segment, at least 25%, advocate for an immediate withdrawal.\n\nConsidering that the very people the US is trying to help are urging them to leave, it's worth taking their opinions seriously. If the US were to ask for their input and they requested withdrawal, it would absolve the US of responsibility if things were to deteriorate further. If the US were to decide to assist Iraq after that, it would at least be seen as a more benevolent action than the current situation. Although, it's unlikely the US will ever be viewed as a benevolent force in the Middle East, this course of action would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While it's true that the United States has made progress in addressing gender discrimination, I still believe it's a significant issue that affects various aspects of society. The problem isn't limited to women, as men also face challenges, particularly in industries where traditional gender roles are prevalent. For instance, in the corporate world, women often struggle to advance to senior positions due to the \"glass ceiling,\" despite their qualifications, because of societal expectations and outdated stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often face criticism and judgment from others, who view it as unusual for men to be primary caregivers. This can be particularly challenging for stay-at-home dads who may have always envisioned themselves in this role. The fashion industry is another area where men are often stereotyped and may not be taken seriously if they're interested in fashion.\n\nHowever, it's heartening to see that there are positive changes taking place. As more women break into leadership positions and become CEOs, they're helping to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes. Moreover, stay-at-home dads are becoming increasingly accepted as primary caregivers, and men in the fashion industry are being taken more seriously. But changing societal attitudes takes time, and it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals in non-traditional roles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other forms of discrimination, such as socioeconomic background and geographical location, can also affect individuals, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area with limited educational opportunities may face prejudice from others in the corporate world, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Ultimately, addressing these complex issues requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the various factors at play and promotes understanding, acceptance, and equality.",
            "It seems that decriminalizing marijuana has reduced its classification from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction similar to a traffic ticket, eliminating the need for arrest and detention. However, this change does not entirely eliminate the potential consequences of being caught, such as affecting job prospects and future opportunities. Although proponents argue that decriminalization can help reduce costs associated with prosecution, law enforcement, and the judicial system, some municipalities may be hesitant to adopt this approach due to philosophical or financial concerns.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there is a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization has led to a significant increase in revenue that can be allocated towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and support for the homeless. On the other hand, some people worry that full legalization could lead to a similar situation as cigarette sales, with marijuana being freely available and potentially contributing to impaired driving and societal disapproval.\n\nIt's worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. However, individuals react differently to substances, and some may be more prone to overindulgence than others. While it's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, it's clear that it can have significant impacts on people's lives, particularly when used excessively. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana use depends on various factors, including the individual's personality and behavior.",
            "I would say that the Catholic Church has a mix of traditional practices and a need to adapt to change. While it's beneficial to draw from its rich history, it's also essential to be flexible and open to new ideas. However, the Church's stance on certain issues seems contradictory. On one hand, it emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching. On the other hand, it often appears to be intolerant of those who don't adhere to its doctrine or come from different faiths.\n\nFor instance, my own family experienced this intolerance firsthand when my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's non-Catholic background. This behavior is hypocritical, as it contradicts the Church's message of acceptance and love.\n\nAdditionally, some Catholic teachings seem to be outdated and don't align with the values they promote. Despite this, the Church continues to stick to these practices. I personally believe that allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, but I'm not convinced that it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilia is a complex issue that likely stems from more than just marital status, and those who would engage in such behavior are unlikely to be deterred by marriage.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that child abuse can happen regardless of whether a priest is married or not. The root of the issue is not the priest's marital status but rather the underlying behavior and circumstances. Therefore, allowing priests to marry is unlikely to be a solution to this problem.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and I don't think I can take a stance on whether one side is right or wrong. This topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage, which can be a sensitive subject. \n\nIt's difficult to approach this without potentially offending someone, and the concept of marriage is quite complex. I'm not convinced that the government should be involved in defining what constitutes a marriage, especially considering it's often considered a sacrament. If two people are married, they should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs, and shouldn't be subject to different tax benefits or government recognition based on their baptism. \n\nIn theory, marriage should be viewed as a civil union between two consenting adults, rather than something that's defined by the government or a specific church. The concept of gay marriage, in this context, is essentially the same as a civil union between two people. \n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it would be logical to push for federal recognition of this. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage. This issue doesn't have the significance or the broad support needed to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a matter of constitutional importance, and the constitution should not be altered to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to some ambivalence towards homosexuality. However, having close friendships with gay individuals has made me more understanding, even if I don't fully agree with their lifestyle choices. While I don't think it should be a national issue, I believe each state should have the autonomy to decide on the legalization of gay marriage, rather than the federal government imposing a single decision. This approach reflects the diverse nature of the United States, where both Democratic and Republican states have varying views on the matter. If someone chooses to live in a state that has legalized gay marriage, they should respect the local decision, as it is a choice they made. In my opinion, homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, and the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. Furthermore, as President Bush's ban on gay marriage is a national decision, it's unreasonable for him to impose his views on every state, considering he doesn't live in every state and will be out of office soon. Ultimately, decisions like this should be left to the states, as they will be directly affected by the outcome, not the president.",
            "I don't think Myspace should be considered a private space, given that it's a public platform. When you post something online, you have to expect that others, including school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. In the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe it's perfectly reasonable for school officials to monitor online activity if it makes the school a safer place.\n\nWhile I understand concerns about privacy, if monitoring online activity leads to the prevention of a school shooting or makes the school a better and safer environment, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, schools often take measures to ensure student safety, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness, which can be related to preventing incidents like school shootings.\n\nIt's true that anything posted online can be accessed and potentially used against someone in the future, but this doesn't necessarily make it an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safe school environment. School officials may monitor online activity to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, but this can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent harm and create a safer school environment.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between monitoring online activity and respecting students' privacy. If school officials have evidence that leads to a specific concern, such as a student engaging in prohibited behavior, it's reasonable for them to investigate further. However, randomly searching through students' online activity without cause can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and monitoring online activity can be a means to achieve this goal. However, it's essential to do so in a manner that respects students' rights to privacy and doesn't unfairly target individuals.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure school environment, not to unfairly target students or invade their privacy.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of the war due to my personal connection to 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation, I believe that the emotional response at the time led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term consequences. As a result, we entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately led to negative outcomes. I now strongly oppose the war and do not think it achieved its intended goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in the affected region are currently preoccupied with internal conflicts and are unable to focus on fighting against external threats. Therefore, our presence in the area is unlikely to have a significant impact on the situation. Unfortunately, my experiences with the aftermath of 9/11 have led me to become desensitized to the situation in the region, and I struggle to muster concern for their plight.\n\nI believe that the concept of war differs significantly between us and the people in the region, with their approach being more brutal and less focused on nation-building. I think they are mainly driven by a desire to expel foreign forces, and I am open to the idea of withdrawing our troops.\n\nIn hindsight, I think our decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. President Bush made a decision to declare war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations at the time, I believe we could have approached the situation with more caution and a clearer plan.\n\nI think it's unlikely that we can fundamentally change the people in the region, as their culture and ways of life are deeply ingrained. Our presence has not brought about significant progress, and I believe it's counterproductive to continue our involvement. In fact, I think it's only a matter of time before the situation collapses once we leave, and we risk harming ourselves by prolonging our stay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to undergo some changes in certain aspects. The decline in followers is partly due to the Church's inflexibility regarding various issues. For instance, its views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are often perceived as outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern approach, it might be able to retain its followers. \n\nAs it stands, some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because its stance on these issues doesn't align with their own values. For individuals who believe in the right to abortion or support gay marriage, being part of a community where these practices are condemned can be uncomfortable. \n\nThe Church's stance against abortion and its disapproval of gay marriage might drive away those who hold different views. It's also worth considering the Church's stance on female priests and married priests. While some may argue that allowing priests to be married or having female priests could have prevented past issues, it's difficult to say for certain. \n\nThe Catholic Church views its priests as being married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, this is unlike any other profession, where individuals have a life outside of work. It seems unreasonable that priests cannot have a similar balance of work and personal life.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any personal objections to gay marriage. In my opinion, a person's sexual orientation is not something they can choose; it's a natural part of who they are. Therefore, I believe that gay individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to deny them the right to marry, just as it would be wrong to deny someone the right to marry because of their skin color or any other innate trait.\n\nI think the idea that someone's sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception. Just as we are born with certain physical and emotional characteristics, some people are naturally attracted to the same sex. It's not something they can change or control.\n\nI don't think it's the government's place to dictate who can and cannot get married, especially when it comes to something as personal as sexual orientation. This issue is not about national security, morality, or any other government concern; it's simply about allowing individuals to make their own choices about who they love and want to spend their lives with.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or punished for their natural orientation. It's essential to respect and accept people for who they are, rather than trying to change or control them.",
            "In my opinion, gay marriage should be legalized without any reservations. The main reason for this is that there is no valid argument against it. Some people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is misguided. The concept of same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. However, both types of relationships share many commonalities and should be treated with the same respect.\n\nOne of the primary concerns surrounding gay marriage is the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners, particularly in situations where one partner requires medical attention. Currently, same-sex partners are not considered family members and are often denied the right to visit their loved ones in hospitals or make important medical decisions. This is unfair, especially considering that many same-sex relationships can be just as fulfilling and enduring as opposite-sex relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as opposite-sex couples. They also face similar challenges and have the same desires for commitment and companionship.\n\nThe main issue at hand is not about religious objections to same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing the rights of same-sex couples in a legal context. Gay couples are not seeking to get married in a church, but rather to obtain a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is \"separate but unequal\" is particularly problematic. Denying same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is discriminatory and unjust. Many people worry about the impact of gay marriage on children and communities, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, research has shown that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as children raised by straight parents. Moreover, the main issue with adoption is not the sexual orientation of the adoptive parents, but rather the way society treats children with same-sex parents.\n\nIn some cases, children of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in schools, highlighting the need for greater understanding and acceptance. However, this does not mean that gay parents are inherently flawed or that their children are at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the federal government should take a proactive role in making gay marriage legal across all states. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is morally and ethically flawed, as it ignores the diversity of American culture and values. Rather than imposing a single, narrow perspective on the nation, our government should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all citizens.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to recognize that people's views on morality and gay rights vary greatly, and it's not fair to impose one group's beliefs on the rest of society. The American Psychological Association has already debunked the myth that being gay is a result of psychological damage or trauma, and it's time for people to listen to credible research and evidence rather than relying on unverified opinions and cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've come to realize that the fact a drug is prohibited doesn't necessarily mean it lacks potential benefits. While I believe it shouldn't be accessible to the general public, I think its therapeutic potential should be acknowledged. Many controlled substances used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are also considered illegal but are still utilized due to their benefits. Therefore, I think we should not dismiss the potential advantages of marijuana solely because of the stigma surrounding it. \n\nIt's worth noting that marijuana's potential for abuse is often compared to that of alcohol, which can also lead to negative consequences when misused. However, I don't think they're comparable in this context. Perhaps what we need is a gradual introduction of marijuana's use, allowing people to become more familiar with it and potentially use it responsibly. This would require a shift in public perception and the removal of the negative image associated with marijuana. By doing so, we can encourage its use for medicinal purposes while minimizing the risk of abuse. Many people have a misguided view of marijuana due to its current illicit status, but it's not as detrimental as other substances like heroin or cocaine. By changing this public perception, we can promote responsible use of marijuana for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the changing times of the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. When I was younger, I would regularly attend church on Sundays, dressing up in matching outfits with my friends from a private school. However, the church has since introduced shorter masses, often lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer when beachwear is common. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere has become more noticeable, even in morning masses where I used to dress up. \n\nRegarding the recent scandals surrounding Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are still men who, despite being married or unmarried, have a predilection for children. It's not necessarily the institution of marriage or celibacy that contributes to this issue, but rather the individual's inherent nature. Some other faiths permit married clergy, yet cases of pedophilia still occur, suggesting that personal choices and genetics play a significant role.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientations and tendencies may be determined by genetics, and cannot be changed by external factors, such as upbringings or institutions. This means that the church's rules about marriage and celibacy might not be the primary cause of these issues. If the church was aware of and tried to conceal these incidents, that's a different matter altogether, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules had a significant impact on the prevalence of pedophilia among its clergy.",
            "The speaker initially found the idea acceptable but felt that the timing of the Iraq invasion was problematic, coming as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks. They believe the Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, despite the claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This deception, particularly Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, has left a lasting negative impression on the speaker. They view the administration's actions as a disregard for the Constitution and an attempt to marginalize it.\n\nThe speaker also suggests that the Bush administration had a predetermined desire for war, with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from a perceived slight against his father and a desire to expand the US energy supply. They feel that the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more bloodshed.\n\nThe proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order in Iraq is seen as problematic, as it may infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty and lead to long-term issues with the interim government's effectiveness. The speaker expresses skepticism about the ability of the current Parliament to function and notes the influence of radical elements in the political process, which could lead to further instability.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, viewing their actions as a betrayal of the public trust and a disregard for the Constitution. They are uncertain about the best course of action, recognizing that any decision will likely have far-reaching consequences.",
            "The conversation revolves around the speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, they express confusion about the war, stating that it wasn't formally declared by Congress, which they believe is a requirement for a war to be considered a legitimate one. They also mention that the war was likely a response to the 9/11 attacks, and that the primary goals are to establish democracy and secure access to oil resources.\n\nHowever, the speaker feels that these objectives are not justified, as the war has caused widespread suffering and upset. They mention that staying in Iraq would lead to a lengthy and difficult process of building democracy, which is unlikely to succeed. If the US were to withdraw, Iraqis might be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, potentially leading to further resentment towards the US.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears, suggesting that the war should continue because it wouldn't be fair to pull out now. They argue that the conflict is not a \"war\" in the classical sense, but rather a demonstration of US military power. They also express sympathy for President Bush, who they believe is being unfairly criticized for the war's outcome.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the complexity of the situation, with the speaker acknowledging the importance of considering the human cost of the conflict, particularly for families with loved ones serving in Iraq. However, they also worry that US involvement is exacerbating the situation and creating further divisions within Iraqi society. They fear that attempting to impose American values and democracy on Iraq could ultimately lead to more harm and create an even stronger sense of anti-American sentiment.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the conflict will likely drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly disagree with the idea of making it a law or allowing the state to declare it as legal, as I believe it's a matter that should be left to the discretion of churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which is crucial for maintaining religious tolerance in the United States. Attempting to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing for its illegality are unfairly imposing their own church's beliefs on others, as many Christians and Catholics oppose it. Instead, the government should respect the autonomy of churches to decide what is and isn't acceptable. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for diverse religious practices and beliefs.\n\nMaking an amendment to address this issue would be misguided and contradictory to the constitution's existing principles. Moreover, it would be one of the rare instances where the government would be restricting the people rather than itself. I believe it's not the government's place to intervene in this matter, especially when their motivations seem to be driven by personal biases rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nThe president's push for this amendment appears to be rooted in his personal Catholic beliefs, which would unfairly favor one religion over others. There's no substantial reason to support an amendment that would restrict the freedom of churches, as it wouldn't have a significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society by allowing religious tolerance to flourish.\n\nOverall, I believe the decision should be left to the churches, and the government should refrain from imposing its will on this issue.",
            "The Iraq War was a complex and contentious issue. From the outset, there were concerns that the US government was not entirely transparent about the reasons for the invasion. It seemed that the government attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to manipulate public emotions, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, were against it, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.\n\nIn some ways, the Iraq War resembled the Vietnam War, where the US government attempted to impose a democratic government on a foreign nation. However, history had shown that such efforts often led to a long and challenging process, with significant loss of life and difficulty in establishing stability. The US government seemed unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, including the power vacuum and ensuing chaos.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was seen as a way to establish democracy, similar to the US government's goals in Vietnam. However, the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of winning the hearts and minds of the local population were grossly underestimated. The presence of insurgents and the need to fight against a civilian population made the conflict much harder to win.\n\nThe speaker believes that the US government should not have entered the war without proper planning for various outcomes. The aftermath of the invasion was not given sufficient consideration, and the country is still struggling with instability and violence nearly a decade later. Many American soldiers have lost their lives in the conflict, and the training of Iraqi security forces has been a slow and arduous process.\n\nThe speaker questions the true motives behind the invasion, suggesting that the US government may have been driven by self-interest, particularly the desire to control Iraq's oil resources. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as well as the government's willingness to tolerate similar threats from other nations (such as North Korea), has led to suspicions of deception and a lack of thoroughness in decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the speaker hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict, but is uncertain if this will come to pass.",
            "For me, the issue of gay marriage is quite clear-cut – I've always been in favor of it. I think it's a matter of personal preference, and research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological basis rather than being determined by societal factors. It would be inhumane to deny individuals rights based on something beyond their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government and politics should not interfere with this personal choice.\n\nIn fact, this issue is not even a matter of state or national politics; it's a personal matter that affects individuals and their families. In my own neighborhood, I've seen several openly gay couples who lead their lives just like any other family, contributing to their community in the same way. However, they are unable to get married due to laws that prevent them from doing so. I find it absurd that politicians, like President Bush, attempt to redefine the concept of marriage according to their own interpretations.\n\nRecent studies suggest that homosexuality may be influenced by a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than by upbringing or environmental factors. For instance, a person might be predisposed to being homosexual regardless of whether they have siblings or a father figure. This highlights the biological aspect of sexual orientation, rather than any sociological influence.\n\nFrom my perspective, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a public or federal issue. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention to themselves, but if a gay couple wants to get married, it becomes a national news story. This disparity is unacceptable, and I believe that marriage should be treated as a personal, private matter, rather than a public concern.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public information that anyone can access, including your school. As a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand how this can lead to issues. Posts about violence or threats can lead people to have a negative opinion of you, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they might share your content with others, including school officials.\n\nIn the case that occurred at my school, a student overheard someone mentioning something concerning and reported it to the authorities. When they investigated, they found concerning content on the student's social media profiles that could have been taken as a joke in a different context. This highlights the importance of being mindful of what you share online, as there's no expectation of privacy once it's out there.\n\nIf you don't want people to see something, don't post it online. You can't control what others think or how they react to your content. While I don't think it's right for school officials to be friends with students on social media and monitoring their online activity, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.\n\nIn fact, I think it's a good idea for teachers and RAs to maintain a professional boundary with their students by not creating fake social media accounts or friending them on those platforms. If you're in a position of authority, it's best to avoid being connected to your students' personal lives, as it can create unnecessary complications and responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, the internet is a public forum, and what you post can have real-world consequences. Be careful about what you share online, and be aware of the potential impact it can have on your relationships and reputation.",
            "The conflict has dragged on for an unnecessarily long period. While the initial objective of establishing democracy in another nation was commendable, it appears that this goal has been lost sight of over time. The war seems to have become a means to assert global dominance rather than a genuine attempt to bring about positive change. The motivations behind the war, particularly considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, are also questionable.\n\nIn my opinion, if the primary intention was to introduce democracy to a country with an unfair system, then that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal agendas played a significant role, it would be unfair. It's clear that the war's purpose has been distorted over time, and the conflict has become a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nI believe that the initial stages of the war served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged duration has been excessive. We've been pouring billions of dollars into the conflict, diverting funds away from pressing domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's crucial that we reassess our priorities and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nThe war has already lasted for an extended period, and it's time for the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. We should withdraw our support and redirect the funds to address our own internal problems. The financial burden of this conflict is substantial, and it's essential that we utilize our resources more effectively, focusing on pressing domestic issues rather than propping up a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "The person would like to clarify that they don't think it's an invasion of privacy if someone finds information online. They argue that when you post content on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone, as seen on platforms like Myspace where profiles are only visible to friends. By adding someone as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to view your profile. Therefore, individuals should be aware that a significant number of people may see the information they post online.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes more complex when considering how to balance individual freedom with the potential consequences. While it's not feasible for one person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent harm, it could be seen as unfair to single out certain individuals for scrutiny. The situation also raises questions about the role of social media monitoring in schools and whether it's appropriate for authorities to restrict students' access to platforms like Myspace.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experience with Facebook and concerns about online safety. They mention a disturbing example of someone using a social media platform to gather information about a person and manipulate them into meeting. This highlights the potential risks of sharing personal details online, making it challenging to strike a balance between maintaining online presence and protecting one's anonymity.\n\nThe speaker also brings up a story about their roommate's high school, where students were banned from using Myspace. They question the authority of school officials to restrict students' online activities, suggesting that this may have been an overreach regarding individual privacy. The speaker concludes by expressing uncertainty about the school's right to dictate what online platforms students can use.",
            "Reflecting on the Iraq War, I'm hesitant to share my views due to the common criticism of jumping on the bandwagon of those who opposed it from the start. However, I did express my opposition initially, and it's not a pressing concern anymore now that the general consensus worldwide has solidified that the war was ill-conceived, except within the administration, which struggles to acknowledge their mistakes.\n\nA global survey of public opinion reveals a stark reality: a significant majority, ranging from 75% to 80%, across the world, the US, and Iraq, believe the war was a poor decision. Even US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, think it was a misguided effort and advocate for a speedy withdrawal within a year. This widespread opposition underscores the war's disastrous consequences from the outset, which have continued to escalate since the US involvement.\n\nThe issue boils down to a profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations, which previous administrations have struggled to bridge. The notion that the US can impose democracy on a region that has its own unique values and preferences is misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a malevolent leader, the decision to invade Iraq wasn't taken lightly, and the costs have been devastating.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq remains dire, it's challenging to justify continued US presence. While the administration might propose potential benefits of staying, I haven't been convinced by their arguments. If anything, a gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer wouldn't be unreasonable. In fact, the majority of Iraqis, approximately 80%, believe the US should leave within a year, and a significant segment, at least 25%, advocate for an immediate withdrawal.\n\nConsidering that the very people the US is trying to help are urging them to leave, it's worth taking their opinions seriously. If the US were to ask for their input and they requested withdrawal, it would absolve the US of responsibility if things were to deteriorate further. If the US were to decide to assist Iraq after that, it would at least be seen as a more benevolent action than the current situation. Although, it's unlikely the US will ever be viewed as a benevolent force in the Middle East, this course of action would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While it's true that the United States has made progress in addressing gender discrimination, I still believe it's a significant issue that affects various aspects of society. The problem isn't limited to women, as men also face challenges, particularly in industries where traditional gender roles are prevalent. For instance, in the corporate world, women often struggle to advance to senior positions due to the \"glass ceiling,\" despite their qualifications, because of societal expectations and outdated stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often face criticism and judgment from others, who view it as unusual for men to be primary caregivers. This can be particularly challenging for stay-at-home dads who may have always envisioned themselves in this role. The fashion industry is another area where men are often stereotyped and may not be taken seriously if they're interested in fashion.\n\nHowever, it's heartening to see that there are positive changes taking place. As more women break into leadership positions and become CEOs, they're helping to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes. Moreover, stay-at-home dads are becoming increasingly accepted as primary caregivers, and men in the fashion industry are being taken more seriously. But changing societal attitudes takes time, and it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals in non-traditional roles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other forms of discrimination, such as socioeconomic background and geographical location, can also affect individuals, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area with limited educational opportunities may face prejudice from others in the corporate world, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Ultimately, addressing these complex issues requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the various factors at play and promotes understanding, acceptance, and equality.",
            "It seems that decriminalizing marijuana has reduced its classification from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction similar to a traffic ticket, eliminating the need for arrest and detention. However, this change does not entirely eliminate the potential consequences of being caught, such as affecting job prospects and future opportunities. Although proponents argue that decriminalization can help reduce costs associated with prosecution, law enforcement, and the judicial system, some municipalities may be hesitant to adopt this approach due to philosophical or financial concerns.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there is a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization has led to a significant increase in revenue that can be allocated towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and support for the homeless. On the other hand, some people worry that full legalization could lead to a similar situation as cigarette sales, with marijuana being freely available and potentially contributing to impaired driving and societal disapproval.\n\nIt's worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. However, individuals react differently to substances, and some may be more prone to overindulgence than others. While it's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, it's clear that it can have significant impacts on people's lives, particularly when used excessively. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana use depends on various factors, including the individual's personality and behavior.",
            "I would say that the Catholic Church has a mix of traditional practices and a need to adapt to change. While it's beneficial to draw from its rich history, it's also essential to be flexible and open to new ideas. However, the Church's stance on certain issues seems contradictory. On one hand, it emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching. On the other hand, it often appears to be intolerant of those who don't adhere to its doctrine or come from different faiths.\n\nFor instance, my own family experienced this intolerance firsthand when my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's non-Catholic background. This behavior is hypocritical, as it contradicts the Church's message of acceptance and love.\n\nAdditionally, some Catholic teachings seem to be outdated and don't align with the values they promote. Despite this, the Church continues to stick to these practices. I personally believe that allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, but I'm not convinced that it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilia is a complex issue that likely stems from more than just marital status, and those who would engage in such behavior are unlikely to be deterred by marriage.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that child abuse can happen regardless of whether a priest is married or not. The root of the issue is not the priest's marital status but rather the underlying behavior and circumstances. Therefore, allowing priests to marry is unlikely to be a solution to this problem.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and I don't think I can take a stance on whether one side is right or wrong. This topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage, which can be a sensitive subject. \n\nIt's difficult to approach this without potentially offending someone, and the concept of marriage is quite complex. I'm not convinced that the government should be involved in defining what constitutes a marriage, especially considering it's often considered a sacrament. If two people are married, they should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs, and shouldn't be subject to different tax benefits or government recognition based on their baptism. \n\nIn theory, marriage should be viewed as a civil union between two consenting adults, rather than something that's defined by the government or a specific church. The concept of gay marriage, in this context, is essentially the same as a civil union between two people. \n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it would be logical to push for federal recognition of this. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage. This issue doesn't have the significance or the broad support needed to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a matter of constitutional importance, and the constitution should not be altered to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to some ambivalence towards homosexuality. However, having close friendships with gay individuals has made me more understanding, even if I don't fully agree with their lifestyle choices. While I don't think it should be a national issue, I believe each state should have the autonomy to decide on the legalization of gay marriage, rather than the federal government imposing a single decision. This approach reflects the diverse nature of the United States, where both Democratic and Republican states have varying views on the matter. If someone chooses to live in a state that has legalized gay marriage, they should respect the local decision, as it is a choice they made. In my opinion, homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, and the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. Furthermore, as President Bush's ban on gay marriage is a national decision, it's unreasonable for him to impose his views on every state, considering he doesn't live in every state and will be out of office soon. Ultimately, decisions like this should be left to the states, as they will be directly affected by the outcome, not the president.",
            "I don't think Myspace should be considered a private space, given that it's a public platform. When you post something online, you have to expect that others, including school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. In the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe it's perfectly reasonable for school officials to monitor online activity if it makes the school a safer place.\n\nWhile I understand concerns about privacy, if monitoring online activity leads to the prevention of a school shooting or makes the school a better and safer environment, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, schools often take measures to ensure student safety, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness, which can be related to preventing incidents like school shootings.\n\nIt's true that anything posted online can be accessed and potentially used against someone in the future, but this doesn't necessarily make it an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safe school environment. School officials may monitor online activity to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, but this can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent harm and create a safer school environment.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between monitoring online activity and respecting students' privacy. If school officials have evidence that leads to a specific concern, such as a student engaging in prohibited behavior, it's reasonable for them to investigate further. However, randomly searching through students' online activity without cause can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and monitoring online activity can be a means to achieve this goal. However, it's essential to do so in a manner that respects students' rights to privacy and doesn't unfairly target individuals.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure school environment, not to unfairly target students or invade their privacy.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of the war due to my personal connection to 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation, I believe that the emotional response at the time led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term consequences. As a result, we entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately led to negative outcomes. I now strongly oppose the war and do not think it achieved its intended goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in the affected region are currently preoccupied with internal conflicts and are unable to focus on fighting against external threats. Therefore, our presence in the area is unlikely to have a significant impact on the situation. Unfortunately, my experiences with the aftermath of 9/11 have led me to become desensitized to the situation in the region, and I struggle to muster concern for their plight.\n\nI believe that the concept of war differs significantly between us and the people in the region, with their approach being more brutal and less focused on nation-building. I think they are mainly driven by a desire to expel foreign forces, and I am open to the idea of withdrawing our troops.\n\nIn hindsight, I think our decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. President Bush made a decision to declare war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations at the time, I believe we could have approached the situation with more caution and a clearer plan.\n\nI think it's unlikely that we can fundamentally change the people in the region, as their culture and ways of life are deeply ingrained. Our presence has not brought about significant progress, and I believe it's counterproductive to continue our involvement. In fact, I think it's only a matter of time before the situation collapses once we leave, and we risk harming ourselves by prolonging our stay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on several issues in order to prevent a decline in its following. One possible reason for this decline is the church's rigidity on certain topics, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated by some. By adapting to a more modern perspective, the church may be able to retain its followers who feel alienated by its conservative views. \n\nMany people are beginning to question the Catholic Church's stance on these issues and may choose not to follow the church if they disagree with its teachings. For instance, individuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable belonging to a community that views these practices as morally wrong. Similarly, people who value personal freedom and autonomy may be put off by the church's strict views on these matters.\n\nThe Catholic Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is another area where some may see the institution as out of touch. It's hard to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have prevented past scandals, but it's clear that these issues are not necessarily linked. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to question why the church bars priests from marrying and having a family life, especially when many other professionals are able to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nThe church's argument that priests are married to God and devoted to their spiritual calling doesn't necessarily justify its stance on marriage and family life. In reality, most people have multiple commitments and responsibilities, and it's not unreasonable to expect priests to have a similar balance in their lives.",
            "Personally, I don't object to same-sex marriage. It's my opinion that people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, so it's unfair to hold them accountable for it. Therefore, I believe it's wrong to deny marriage rights to couples of the same sex while allowing heterosexual couples to marry. I haven't given much thought to the issue, but I firmly believe that this discrimination is unjust.\n\nIt seems that sexual orientation isn't a matter of personal choice, as people are born with their natural inclinations. I was born straight, and others are born gay – it's just a natural aspect of who they are. I don't think they should be blamed or held accountable for their orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's a personal matter that doesn't concern the government. I don't think it's right for them to intervene in people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal relationships and identities.\n\nUltimately, people should be free to be who they are without fear of persecution or judgment. The government's involvement in this issue seems out of place and unnecessary. Gay people are not responsible for their orientation, and they shouldn't be punished for it. They should be treated with respect and equality, just like anyone else.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people think that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but they are simply two different sides of the same coin, with their own unique characteristics. The notion that gay couples are a threat is unfounded and lacks evidence. \n\nResearch has shown that gay couples fare similarly to straight couples in terms of relationship satisfaction, and they have the same fundamental needs and desires. They're not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather for a legal document that acknowledges their union, which is a civil matter, not a religious one. \n\nThe argument that allowing gay marriage would lead to the erosion of traditional values is a weak one. It's similar to saying that civil rights for African Americans or women would lead to the downfall of society. The idea that gay people are morally flawed or that their sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception that has been disproven by scientific studies. \n\nThe opposition to gay marriage is often rooted in ignorance and a lack of understanding. People's moral compasses may vary, but it's unfair to impose one group's morality on the entire country. Moreover, it's hypocritical for politicians to push for laws that enforce their own moral standards without considering the perspectives of others.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a choice. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. It's essential to rely on research and evidence rather than anecdotal opinions or popular culture.\n\nUltimately, I think the federal government should take a more progressive stance on this issue and legalize gay marriage across the country. The idea that the government should intervene in personal relationships and dictate who can or cannot get married is a flawed one. It's time for us to move forward and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "To clarify my stance on the availability of certain substances, I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand the benefits of using controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, which are often misunderstood due to their legal status. Conversely, I believe that just because marijuana is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it lacks beneficial properties. In fact, if its medicinal uses are acknowledged, it could be a valuable treatment option for patients.\n\nWhile it's true that abusing any substance can lead to negative consequences, the comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely accurate. However, a more gradual introduction of marijuana into the legal system might mitigate potential abuse. The primary issue lies in the stigma surrounding marijuana, which is often fueled by its illegality. By reevaluating this stigma and understanding that marijuana is not as detrimental as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine, we may be able to encourage responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.\n\nBy removing the negative image associated with marijuana, people may become more inclined to use it responsibly, and its benefits can be harnessed for the greater good. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to marijuana's regulation could lead to a better understanding of its potential and its place in healthcare.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the modern era, and its strictness has decreased over time. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed that the atmosphere and dress code have become more casual. In my younger days, I would wear matching dresses and accessories, but now I see people attending in beachwear and casual clothing, even on Sundays. The church has introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, lasting only thirty minutes, and people generally dress down, especially during the summer months.\n\nAs I reflect on the church I know, I don't have insight into its internal politics, but I do think it has become more relaxed. However, I don't believe allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with these inclinations. While some people might try to suppress their desires, they often resurface. Therefore, I don't think the church's rules regarding marriage for priests would have made a difference.\n\nIt's essential to note that even married individuals with children can still develop pedophilic tendencies. Thus, I think it's more about the individual's inherent nature rather than their marital status. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different denomination that allows for this. The Catholic Church's stance on this matter might not be the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn my opinion, if the church was aware of and intentionally covered up these issues, that's a different story, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules could have prevented these incidents from occurring. If anything, I think it's essential to acknowledge that pedophilia is a complex issue linked to genetics and that marriage or the lack thereof is not a determining factor.",
            "I initially had reservations about the premise of the Iraq War, particularly because it came on the heels of the September 11th attacks. I believe the Bush administration used the war as a pretext, linking it to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that have since been proven false. This deception has been deeply disturbing to me, and the Iraq War continues to evoke strong emotions. \n\nThe Bush administration's transparent lies to the American people, as evidenced by Colin Powell's later admissions that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN, are a serious offense that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to erode it since 9/11 are equally concerning. It appears that the Bush administration had planned to go to war from the outset, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy supply.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, withdrawing now could lead to further chaos and bloodshed. The UN and the US are considering a coalition of regional nations to maintain order, but I'm skeptical about this plan, as it may ultimately undermine Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government is ineffective, with a dysfunctional Parliament and a lack of control from the Prime Minister. The presence of radical elements, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds significant power, is exacerbating the political instability.",
            "The speaker has mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They struggle to articulate their thoughts, initially stating that they feel it's pointless due to the fact that it was not officially declared as a war by Congress. They suggest that the US invaded Iraq as a form of retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, which they believe was a primary motivation for the conflict. The speaker is uncertain about the reasons for the US presence in Iraq, citing the possibility of trying to build democracy and gain access to oil resources as potential justifications. However, they argue that these reasons are not sufficient, as the war has led to widespread unrest and destruction in the region.\n\nThe speaker also expresses concerns about the long-term consequences of the war, including the potential for the US to try to impose its own system of government on Iraq, which could exacerbate the situation. They worry that the US presence will fuel the growth of anti-American sentiment, particularly among extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the speaker suggests that the war should continue, but not be referred to as a war, as it was not officially declared by Congress. They imply that the US is using military force to assert its power and dominance rather than to address a legitimate threat. However, this stance is later complicated by the speaker's empathy for families affected by the war, including those with loved ones serving in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the war in Iraq is a complex and multifaceted issue, with no clear solution in sight. They predict that the conflict will continue for years to come, with uncertain outcomes and unintended consequences.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for states to legalize or declare it as permissible. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, seems to suggest that this decision should be left to individual churches. The attempts to impose laws that restrict certain church activities appear to defy the principles established by the constitution.\n\nWhen considering those pushing for it to be made illegal, I believe it's essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. Many Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's role to dictate which activities are allowed or prohibited by the churches.\n\nThe principle of separation of church and state has been a core aspect of the US constitution, promoting religious tolerance. Proposing an amendment that restricts religious freedom, as I see it, contradicts the existing constitution. Moreover, such an amendment could be one of the few that restricts individual rights rather than limiting government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government and any government should not be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs, rather than a genuine need for a policy change. His actions suggest a preference for one religion over others, which I believe is unfair.\n\nThere's little justification for this amendment, aside from personal opinions. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, I think this decision should be left to individual churches, not the government.",
            "The Iraq war is a topic that raises many concerns about the honesty of the government towards the American people. Prior to the invasion, there are doubts that the government was transparent about the reasons for going to war. The link between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was overstated, and the government exploited the emotions of the American people to justify the invasion. This occurred in 2003, a time when the US was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs someone who generally opposes war, especially a preemptive strike, I believe that the Iraq war has many parallels with the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the consequences of removing a country's government and replacing it with a democratic one. The aftermath of the invasion was chaotic, and the US government was not adequately prepared to deal with the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe goal of installing a democratic government in Iraq was similar to the US's attempt to do the same in Vietnam, but it ultimately led to a protracted and difficult conflict. The US government underestimated the number of insurgents that would resist the occupation, and fighting a war against a nation's citizens is a far more challenging task than fighting a conventional army.\n\nIf the US government is to engage in a war, it must be better prepared for all possible outcomes. In the case of Iraq, the US government was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the country is still experiencing instability and violence. The training of Iraqi security forces and police has been a long and arduous process.\n\nFurthermore, the US government's portrayal of the war as a short and successful endeavor was misleading. Implementing a new form of government and establishing a stable democracy takes time, and the US should not have underestimated the complexity of the task. The US government's actions in Iraq have been criticized for being naive and based on a simplistic understanding of how to establish a democratic government.\n\nThe decision to go to war in Iraq was a difficult one, and it is hard to justify abandoning a country that the US had intervened in. However, the human cost of the war, including the number of American casualties, is a significant concern. The motivations behind the invasion, including the desire to control Iraq's oil resources, have also been questioned.\n\nThe fact that the US government has not taken similar action against other countries with similar issues, such as North Korea, which was known to possess weapons of mass destruction, has raised questions about the US government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the Iraq war has been a complex and multifaceted issue, and its legacy continues to be felt today.\n\nIn the end, the war in Iraq is a reminder of the importance of transparency and thoroughness in the decision-making process, and the need for the US government to be honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war. While it is hoped that the conflict will come to an end soon, the reality is that it may take much longer for the country to achieve stability and peace.",
            "I'd like to express my support for gay marriage. In my opinion, it's a personal preference and not a matter that should be influenced by societal or external factors. Research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological component, rather than being determined by upbringing or societal norms. I believe it's inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something they cannot control.\n\nI think the government and politics should not interfere with personal matters, including marriage. Marriage is a personal and private decision that should be made by individuals, not the government. In fact, I've seen many gay couples in my neighborhood who lead normal, functioning lives, just like any other family. It's absurd to allow politicians to impose their own interpretations of marriage on others.\n\nScientific studies have also shown that there may be a biological basis for homosexuality, rather than it being a result of environmental factors. For example, research has identified specific chemical differences in the brain that may influence an individual's sexual orientation.\n\nWhile there are some who may argue against gay marriage, I believe it's essential to recognize that it's a personal choice and not something that should be subject to public scrutiny. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married without informing anyone, they can do so without it being a major news event. However, when a same-sex couple tries to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. In my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public issue that's subject to federal or national attention.",

School officials have a responsibility to act on such information, even if it's difficult to determine what's serious and what's not.\n\nIn reality, the internet offers little to no privacy, so it's crucial to be mindful of what you share online. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control how others perceive you or what they take seriously. School officials should not friend students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines of their roles and create an invasion of students' privacy. However, if concerns are brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to act. It's a different matter if they're monitoring private communications, but if students share information publicly, it's a different story.\n\nFor example, as a Resident Advisor, I wouldn't create a social media account under a different name to friend students, as this would compromise their trust and make it difficult for me to maintain professional boundaries. Instead, I'd rather not have that connection and avoid being privy to sensitive information that might require my attention.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and its original purpose seems to have been lost in the process. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, which would be a valid reason to intervene, but it's questionable whether personal interests, such as resolving past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, played a role. \n\nIf the primary goal was to establish democracy, it would have been a justifiable reason, but it appears that the motives have shifted over time. The war's initial impact, which was evident in the first few months, was significant, as it made a bold statement. However, the prolonged duration of the war, spanning over a year or several years, has made it clear that the goal has been compromised.\n\nThe original intention of promoting democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant is a legitimate reason for going to war. Nevertheless, the war has lost its purpose and has become a self-sustaining entity. The desire to achieve a decisive victory or avoid defeat has led to further conflict. It's time for the country's government to take responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe war has been costly, with billions of dollars being spent, which could be better allocated to address domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, public education, and healthcare. It's illogical to prioritize funding a foreign war when these pressing issues demand attention. The money being spent could be more effectively used to improve the lives of citizens at home, rather than sacrificing lives in a foreign war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "To clarify, I'd like to ask if you're saying that a life was saved because someone discovered some information online that prevented a potentially threatening situation. I understand that when you share information on the internet, you're essentially making it available for anyone to see. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, you have to accept others as friends, which implies giving them permission to view your profile. \n\nThis raises questions about the balance between online safety and invasion of privacy. While it's impractical to have someone monitor all students' profiles, it's also problematic if schools are only focusing on certain individuals. However, if someone is actively searching for information, it's a different story. The concern then becomes whether they're genuinely looking for evidence of potential threats or just browsing randomly.\n\nPersonally, I'm uneasy about sharing personal details online, even though I have a Facebook account. I've seen examples of people exploiting social media for malicious purposes. For instance, someone might use a person's screen name and instant messaging to deceive them into meeting. This raises concerns about online safety and the potential for stalking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share on social media, but it's hard to strike a balance between being cautious and being able to connect with friends. It's difficult to know who can access your information, even if you only accept people you know.\n\nI recall hearing about a story where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts. It struck me as unusual, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what students could or couldn't have online. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure if it's a matter of privacy or something else entirely.",
            "There's a certain irony in discussing the Iraq War, given my own stance on the matter. I hesitate to join those who claim to have been against it from the beginning, as I was indeed opposed to it, but I don't think it's as significant now, considering the widespread consensus that the war was a bad idea, except within the administration. Looking at recent polls from the US, Iraq, and globally, it's clear that a significant majority of the world's population, around 75-80%, views the war as a mistake. Notably, 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops in the region believe that the war was a poor decision and that the US should withdraw within a year. \n\nThe situation in Iraq was already a disaster before the US involvement, and the situation has only worsened since. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries create significant barriers to understanding and resolving issues in the region. It's unrealistic to expect democracy to be easily imposed on a culture that might not naturally adopt it. Although Saddam was a bad leader, weighing the pros and cons of invading a country that would likely become a disaster was crucial. \n\nGiven the circumstances, it's challenging to see a compelling reason to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I struggle to see why we shouldn't leave now, especially considering that a significant number of Iraqis – including those we're trying to help – want us to leave within the year or immediately. If we ask them and they tell us to leave, it would be clearer that the responsibility for any negative outcome wouldn't lie with the US. \n\nIf we were to leave, we might at least be seen as trying to do the right thing, rather than perpetuating the current problematic situation. Although we'll never be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, it would be better than our current position.",
            "In the United States, it's clear that gender-based discrimination still persists in various aspects of society. While this issue affects both men and women, women often face significant challenges due to the 'glass ceiling' that hinders them from achieving equality. Women may have the qualifications and skills required for a particular position, but they may be overlooked for promotion simply because it's a historically male-dominated field, and society's biases are deeply ingrained. This is particularly evident in industries like business, where women are often expected to be subordinate to men.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations can also affect men who choose to stay at home and care for their children. Men who take on this role are often looked down upon and viewed as unconventional, as traditional societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for men who choose to defy these expectations.\n\nIn other industries, such as fashion, men who are interested in the field may face skepticism and prejudice due to societal stereotypes. For instance, men who work in fashion may be doubted and scrutinized simply because they are men, and people may question their understanding of the industry. However, this is beginning to change as people become more accepting and open-minded.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote awareness and understanding of the qualities and strengths of individuals who have traditionally been marginalized. Rather than forcing change, it's crucial to encourage a more nuanced and inclusive approach that celebrates diversity and challenges societal norms. By promoting acceptance and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nFurthermore, it's also essential to recognize that discrimination can occur within the same gender, depending on factors like education, background, or geographic location. For example, individuals from rural areas with limited access to education may face prejudice from those from more affluent areas who have had better opportunities. This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address inequality.",
            "My understanding is that by decriminalizing marijuana, it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where individuals are issued a citation rather than facing arrest and prosecution. This change can have significant long-term implications, such as affecting job prospects and other opportunities, which are often the most critical consequences of a drug charge. However, proponents of decriminalization argue that the cost of enforcing strict marijuana laws is substantial, including the expenses associated with arrest, booking, and court proceedings. This is particularly relevant for cash-strapped municipalities that may not have the financial resources to pursue such measures, even if it would ultimately save them money in the long run.\n\nIn places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization seems like a viable option. By decriminalizing marijuana, these cities can redirect the funds previously spent on enforcement towards more pressing issues, such as education, social programs, and assistance for the homeless. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use, including its impact on motor skills and overall lifestyle. While some argue that marijuana has a more significant influence on people's behavior, others claim that alcohol has a more detrimental effect on motor skills. Ultimately, individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of negative consequences.",
            "I would agree with this assessment.  The Catholic Church often adheres to traditional practices, which can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability.  However, it's equally crucial for the church to be open to change and adapt to the evolving needs of its members. \n\nSome people believe that the church's rigid adherence to its doctrine can lead to exclusivity and intolerance, particularly towards those who do not conform to Catholic teachings or belong to other faiths.  For instance, my family's experience showed that the church would not perform a marriage between two individuals from different denominations, despite the importance of love and acceptance.\n\nThis sense of hypocrisy can be disheartening, as the Catholic Church preaches love and compassion but fails to live up to these values in practice.  It's puzzling that the church clings to outdated practices, failing to recognize the need for reform.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it could be beneficial, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of child abuse.  Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be directly linked to marital status.  It's likely that individuals who engage in such behavior would continue to do so regardless of their marital status. \n\nIn conclusion, it's essential for the church to balance tradition and modernity, as well as to focus on creating a more inclusive environment that promotes love, acceptance, and compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue, and I don't have a strong opinion on whether one side is right or wrong. However, I believe that this topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between the separation of church and state, as well as defining what constitutes a marriage. It's difficult to approach this topic without offending someone or group.\n\nIn my opinion, all marriages should be viewed as civil unions, regardless of whether they are considered sacraments or not. This is because marriage is essentially a union between two individuals, and the government shouldn't intervene in matters that are typically considered personal and private. If two people decide to enter into a union, they should be treated equally under the law, without any additional scrutiny based on their religious affiliations.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, it's really just about two individuals forming a union, and they should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as anyone else in a civil union. I think it's unnecessary for states to come to a consensus on this issue and then push for federal legislation, as it's not a significant enough concern to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn fact, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it's a matter that affects a relatively small group of people. The constitution should not be changed to accommodate a minority view, especially when it doesn't align with the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our country is built upon.\n\nIn summary, the issue of gay marriage is not significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's best to view all marriages as civil unions, without any additional considerations based on religious beliefs or affiliations.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household had a complex impact on my views on homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I might not fully agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I believe the decision should be left to individual states rather than being imposed by the federal government. \n\nThis approach makes sense, considering the diverse views within different states, with many being democratic and others more conservative. In a democratic state, residents likely support gay marriage, and it's reasonable to accept their decision if they choose to legalize it. By living in a particular state, individuals implicitly agree to abide by its laws and policies.\n\nI believe individuals of all orientations should have equal opportunities, and it's only fair that each state has the autonomy to decide on the issue of gay marriage. It's not up to the federal government, such as a president, to dictate the laws of every state. A president, like Bush, should not have the authority to impose their views on the entire nation, especially if they don't live in every state and will eventually leave office.\n\nUltimately, I think certain decisions should be left to the discretion of individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices. This approach would prevent a constant back-and-forth on the issue, with decisions being reversed by subsequent administrations. By giving states the freedom to decide, we can respect their unique perspectives and allow them to create laws that work best for their residents.",
            "The speaker begins by acknowledging that social media platforms like Myspace are public spaces where users post content for others to see. They argue that if a student posts something on Myspace, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, even if it's not under the school's official name, because they could still access it from home. The speaker believes that school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, which includes monitoring potential threats, such as student behavior that could lead to a school shooting.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that monitoring students' online activities can be an invasion of privacy. They draw a distinction between monitoring student behavior that's intended to catch students doing something wrong and monitoring that's aimed at preventing harm or making the school a safer place. The speaker suggests that the latter is acceptable, even if it means school officials are accessing private online content.\n\nThe speaker compares this to a lockdown drill, which is a measure implemented to ensure student safety, particularly in the wake of a terrorist attack. They see school officials' actions in this case as a similar attempt to prevent harm and make the school a safer place. The speaker concludes that, in their opinion, it's reasonable for school officials to monitor student online activities if it's done to prevent harm and maintain a safe environment.\n\nThe speaker also notes that once content is posted online, it's difficult to control who sees it, and it can come back to haunt the poster in the future. They suggest that students should be cautious when posting online, anticipating that their content may be discovered and used against them.\n\nOverall, the speaker's opinion is that school officials' actions were justified in this case, as they were aimed at preventing harm and maintaining a safe environment for students.",
            "Initially, I had strong support for going to war after 9/11, as it was a personal and emotional issue for me. However, I soon realized that we were not adequately prepared and lacked a clear plan for the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that our decision to invade was driven more by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a well-thought-out strategy. As a result, our involvement in the war ultimately backfired, and we failed to achieve our goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in that region are so consumed by internal conflicts that they cannot possibly focus on fighting against us. It's almost as if they're fighting a war within themselves, and it's pointless for us to try to impose our will on them. I've come to a point where I've lost interest in the situation, and I don't think it's our place to try to change them.\n\nOne of the main problems with our approach was that we didn't fully understand the culture and mindset of the people we were fighting against. War is a vastly different concept for them than it is for us, and it's often driven by tribal and primal instincts rather than a desire to build a better country.\n\nI think we were initially driven by a desire for revenge and a sense of moral duty, rather than a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I can understand his motivations, I think we could have handled the situation differently. We could have taken a more measured approach, with a clear plan and a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, our lack of unity and planning led to a series of costly mistakes. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and our actions only created more chaos and divisions. I believe that we're not equipped to change the people in that region, and they will likely always be driven by their own internal conflicts.\n\nI think it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the war and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the costs and sacrifices we're making. In the end, I believe that our continued presence will only lead to further instability, and it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties handle their own affairs."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on several issues in order to prevent a decline in its following. One possible reason for this decline is the church's rigidity on certain topics, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated by some. By adapting to a more modern perspective, the church may be able to retain its followers who feel alienated by its conservative views. \n\nMany people are beginning to question the Catholic Church's stance on these issues and may choose not to follow the church if they disagree with its teachings. For instance, individuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable belonging to a community that views these practices as morally wrong. Similarly, people who value personal freedom and autonomy may be put off by the church's strict views on these matters.\n\nThe Catholic Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is another area where some may see the institution as out of touch. It's hard to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have prevented past scandals, but it's clear that these issues are not necessarily linked. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to question why the church bars priests from marrying and having a family life, especially when many other professionals are able to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nThe church's argument that priests are married to God and devoted to their spiritual calling doesn't necessarily justify its stance on marriage and family life. In reality, most people have multiple commitments and responsibilities, and it's not unreasonable to expect priests to have a similar balance in their lives.",
            "Personally, I don't object to same-sex marriage. It's my opinion that people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, so it's unfair to hold them accountable for it. Therefore, I believe it's wrong to deny marriage rights to couples of the same sex while allowing heterosexual couples to marry. I haven't given much thought to the issue, but I firmly believe that this discrimination is unjust.\n\nIt seems that sexual orientation isn't a matter of personal choice, as people are born with their natural inclinations. I was born straight, and others are born gay – it's just a natural aspect of who they are. I don't think they should be blamed or held accountable for their orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's a personal matter that doesn't concern the government. I don't think it's right for them to intervene in people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal relationships and identities.\n\nUltimately, people should be free to be who they are without fear of persecution or judgment. The government's involvement in this issue seems out of place and unnecessary. Gay people are not responsible for their orientation, and they shouldn't be punished for it. They should be treated with respect and equality, just like anyone else.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people think that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but they are simply two different sides of the same coin, with their own unique characteristics. The notion that gay couples are a threat is unfounded and lacks evidence. \n\nResearch has shown that gay couples fare similarly to straight couples in terms of relationship satisfaction, and they have the same fundamental needs and desires. They're not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather for a legal document that acknowledges their union, which is a civil matter, not a religious one. \n\nThe argument that allowing gay marriage would lead to the erosion of traditional values is a weak one. It's similar to saying that civil rights for African Americans or women would lead to the downfall of society. The idea that gay people are morally flawed or that their sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception that has been disproven by scientific studies. \n\nThe opposition to gay marriage is often rooted in ignorance and a lack of understanding. People's moral compasses may vary, but it's unfair to impose one group's morality on the entire country. Moreover, it's hypocritical for politicians to push for laws that enforce their own moral standards without considering the perspectives of others.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a choice. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. It's essential to rely on research and evidence rather than anecdotal opinions or popular culture.\n\nUltimately, I think the federal government should take a more progressive stance on this issue and legalize gay marriage across the country. The idea that the government should intervene in personal relationships and dictate who can or cannot get married is a flawed one. It's time for us to move forward and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "To clarify my stance on the availability of certain substances, I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand the benefits of using controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, which are often misunderstood due to their legal status. Conversely, I believe that just because marijuana is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it lacks beneficial properties. In fact, if its medicinal uses are acknowledged, it could be a valuable treatment option for patients.\n\nWhile it's true that abusing any substance can lead to negative consequences, the comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely accurate. However, a more gradual introduction of marijuana into the legal system might mitigate potential abuse. The primary issue lies in the stigma surrounding marijuana, which is often fueled by its illegality. By reevaluating this stigma and understanding that marijuana is not as detrimental as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine, we may be able to encourage responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.\n\nBy removing the negative image associated with marijuana, people may become more inclined to use it responsibly, and its benefits can be harnessed for the greater good. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to marijuana's regulation could lead to a better understanding of its potential and its place in healthcare.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the modern era, and its strictness has decreased over time. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed that the atmosphere and dress code have become more casual. In my younger days, I would wear matching dresses and accessories, but now I see people attending in beachwear and casual clothing, even on Sundays. The church has introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, lasting only thirty minutes, and people generally dress down, especially during the summer months.\n\nAs I reflect on the church I know, I don't have insight into its internal politics, but I do think it has become more relaxed. However, I don't believe allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with these inclinations. While some people might try to suppress their desires, they often resurface. Therefore, I don't think the church's rules regarding marriage for priests would have made a difference.\n\nIt's essential to note that even married individuals with children can still develop pedophilic tendencies. Thus, I think it's more about the individual's inherent nature rather than their marital status. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different denomination that allows for this. The Catholic Church's stance on this matter might not be the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn my opinion, if the church was aware of and intentionally covered up these issues, that's a different story, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules could have prevented these incidents from occurring. If anything, I think it's essential to acknowledge that pedophilia is a complex issue linked to genetics and that marriage or the lack thereof is not a determining factor.",
            "I initially had reservations about the premise of the Iraq War, particularly because it came on the heels of the September 11th attacks. I believe the Bush administration used the war as a pretext, linking it to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that have since been proven false. This deception has been deeply disturbing to me, and the Iraq War continues to evoke strong emotions. \n\nThe Bush administration's transparent lies to the American people, as evidenced by Colin Powell's later admissions that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN, are a serious offense that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to erode it since 9/11 are equally concerning. It appears that the Bush administration had planned to go to war from the outset, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy supply.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, withdrawing now could lead to further chaos and bloodshed. The UN and the US are considering a coalition of regional nations to maintain order, but I'm skeptical about this plan, as it may ultimately undermine Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government is ineffective, with a dysfunctional Parliament and a lack of control from the Prime Minister. The presence of radical elements, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds significant power, is exacerbating the political instability.",
            "The speaker has mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They struggle to articulate their thoughts, initially stating that they feel it's pointless due to the fact that it was not officially declared as a war by Congress. They suggest that the US invaded Iraq as a form of retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, which they believe was a primary motivation for the conflict. The speaker is uncertain about the reasons for the US presence in Iraq, citing the possibility of trying to build democracy and gain access to oil resources as potential justifications. However, they argue that these reasons are not sufficient, as the war has led to widespread unrest and destruction in the region.\n\nThe speaker also expresses concerns about the long-term consequences of the war, including the potential for the US to try to impose its own system of government on Iraq, which could exacerbate the situation. They worry that the US presence will fuel the growth of anti-American sentiment, particularly among extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the speaker suggests that the war should continue, but not be referred to as a war, as it was not officially declared by Congress. They imply that the US is using military force to assert its power and dominance rather than to address a legitimate threat. However, this stance is later complicated by the speaker's empathy for families affected by the war, including those with loved ones serving in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the war in Iraq is a complex and multifaceted issue, with no clear solution in sight. They predict that the conflict will continue for years to come, with uncertain outcomes and unintended consequences.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for states to legalize or declare it as permissible. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, seems to suggest that this decision should be left to individual churches. The attempts to impose laws that restrict certain church activities appear to defy the principles established by the constitution.\n\nWhen considering those pushing for it to be made illegal, I believe it's essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. Many Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's role to dictate which activities are allowed or prohibited by the churches.\n\nThe principle of separation of church and state has been a core aspect of the US constitution, promoting religious tolerance. Proposing an amendment that restricts religious freedom, as I see it, contradicts the existing constitution. Moreover, such an amendment could be one of the few that restricts individual rights rather than limiting government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government and any government should not be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs, rather than a genuine need for a policy change. His actions suggest a preference for one religion over others, which I believe is unfair.\n\nThere's little justification for this amendment, aside from personal opinions. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, I think this decision should be left to individual churches, not the government.",
            "The Iraq war is a topic that raises many concerns about the honesty of the government towards the American people. Prior to the invasion, there are doubts that the government was transparent about the reasons for going to war. The link between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was overstated, and the government exploited the emotions of the American people to justify the invasion. This occurred in 2003, a time when the US was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs someone who generally opposes war, especially a preemptive strike, I believe that the Iraq war has many parallels with the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the consequences of removing a country's government and replacing it with a democratic one. The aftermath of the invasion was chaotic, and the US government was not adequately prepared to deal with the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe goal of installing a democratic government in Iraq was similar to the US's attempt to do the same in Vietnam, but it ultimately led to a protracted and difficult conflict. The US government underestimated the number of insurgents that would resist the occupation, and fighting a war against a nation's citizens is a far more challenging task than fighting a conventional army.\n\nIf the US government is to engage in a war, it must be better prepared for all possible outcomes. In the case of Iraq, the US government was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the country is still experiencing instability and violence. The training of Iraqi security forces and police has been a long and arduous process.\n\nFurthermore, the US government's portrayal of the war as a short and successful endeavor was misleading. Implementing a new form of government and establishing a stable democracy takes time, and the US should not have underestimated the complexity of the task. The US government's actions in Iraq have been criticized for being naive and based on a simplistic understanding of how to establish a democratic government.\n\nThe decision to go to war in Iraq was a difficult one, and it is hard to justify abandoning a country that the US had intervened in. However, the human cost of the war, including the number of American casualties, is a significant concern. The motivations behind the invasion, including the desire to control Iraq's oil resources, have also been questioned.\n\nThe fact that the US government has not taken similar action against other countries with similar issues, such as North Korea, which was known to possess weapons of mass destruction, has raised questions about the US government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the Iraq war has been a complex and multifaceted issue, and its legacy continues to be felt today.\n\nIn the end, the war in Iraq is a reminder of the importance of transparency and thoroughness in the decision-making process, and the need for the US government to be honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war. While it is hoped that the conflict will come to an end soon, the reality is that it may take much longer for the country to achieve stability and peace.",
            "I'd like to express my support for gay marriage. In my opinion, it's a personal preference and not a matter that should be influenced by societal or external factors. Research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological component, rather than being determined by upbringing or societal norms. I believe it's inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something they cannot control.\n\nI think the government and politics should not interfere with personal matters, including marriage. Marriage is a personal and private decision that should be made by individuals, not the government. In fact, I've seen many gay couples in my neighborhood who lead normal, functioning lives, just like any other family. It's absurd to allow politicians to impose their own interpretations of marriage on others.\n\nScientific studies have also shown that there may be a biological basis for homosexuality, rather than it being a result of environmental factors. For example, research has identified specific chemical differences in the brain that may influence an individual's sexual orientation.\n\nWhile there are some who may argue against gay marriage, I believe it's essential to recognize that it's a personal choice and not something that should be subject to public scrutiny. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married without informing anyone, they can do so without it being a major news event. However, when a same-sex couple tries to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. In my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public issue that's subject to federal or national attention.",

School officials have a responsibility to act on such information, even if it's difficult to determine what's serious and what's not.\n\nIn reality, the internet offers little to no privacy, so it's crucial to be mindful of what you share online. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control how others perceive you or what they take seriously. School officials should not friend students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines of their roles and create an invasion of students' privacy. However, if concerns are brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to act. It's a different matter if they're monitoring private communications, but if students share information publicly, it's a different story.\n\nFor example, as a Resident Advisor, I wouldn't create a social media account under a different name to friend students, as this would compromise their trust and make it difficult for me to maintain professional boundaries. Instead, I'd rather not have that connection and avoid being privy to sensitive information that might require my attention.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and its original purpose seems to have been lost in the process. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, which would be a valid reason to intervene, but it's questionable whether personal interests, such as resolving past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, played a role. \n\nIf the primary goal was to establish democracy, it would have been a justifiable reason, but it appears that the motives have shifted over time. The war's initial impact, which was evident in the first few months, was significant, as it made a bold statement. However, the prolonged duration of the war, spanning over a year or several years, has made it clear that the goal has been compromised.\n\nThe original intention of promoting democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant is a legitimate reason for going to war. Nevertheless, the war has lost its purpose and has become a self-sustaining entity. The desire to achieve a decisive victory or avoid defeat has led to further conflict. It's time for the country's government to take responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe war has been costly, with billions of dollars being spent, which could be better allocated to address domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, public education, and healthcare. It's illogical to prioritize funding a foreign war when these pressing issues demand attention. The money being spent could be more effectively used to improve the lives of citizens at home, rather than sacrificing lives in a foreign war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "To clarify, I'd like to ask if you're saying that a life was saved because someone discovered some information online that prevented a potentially threatening situation. I understand that when you share information on the internet, you're essentially making it available for anyone to see. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, you have to accept others as friends, which implies giving them permission to view your profile. \n\nThis raises questions about the balance between online safety and invasion of privacy. While it's impractical to have someone monitor all students' profiles, it's also problematic if schools are only focusing on certain individuals. However, if someone is actively searching for information, it's a different story. The concern then becomes whether they're genuinely looking for evidence of potential threats or just browsing randomly.\n\nPersonally, I'm uneasy about sharing personal details online, even though I have a Facebook account. I've seen examples of people exploiting social media for malicious purposes. For instance, someone might use a person's screen name and instant messaging to deceive them into meeting. This raises concerns about online safety and the potential for stalking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share on social media, but it's hard to strike a balance between being cautious and being able to connect with friends. It's difficult to know who can access your information, even if you only accept people you know.\n\nI recall hearing about a story where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts. It struck me as unusual, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what students could or couldn't have online. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure if it's a matter of privacy or something else entirely.",
            "There's a certain irony in discussing the Iraq War, given my own stance on the matter. I hesitate to join those who claim to have been against it from the beginning, as I was indeed opposed to it, but I don't think it's as significant now, considering the widespread consensus that the war was a bad idea, except within the administration. Looking at recent polls from the US, Iraq, and globally, it's clear that a significant majority of the world's population, around 75-80%, views the war as a mistake. Notably, 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops in the region believe that the war was a poor decision and that the US should withdraw within a year. \n\nThe situation in Iraq was already a disaster before the US involvement, and the situation has only worsened since. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries create significant barriers to understanding and resolving issues in the region. It's unrealistic to expect democracy to be easily imposed on a culture that might not naturally adopt it. Although Saddam was a bad leader, weighing the pros and cons of invading a country that would likely become a disaster was crucial. \n\nGiven the circumstances, it's challenging to see a compelling reason to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I struggle to see why we shouldn't leave now, especially considering that a significant number of Iraqis – including those we're trying to help – want us to leave within the year or immediately. If we ask them and they tell us to leave, it would be clearer that the responsibility for any negative outcome wouldn't lie with the US. \n\nIf we were to leave, we might at least be seen as trying to do the right thing, rather than perpetuating the current problematic situation. Although we'll never be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, it would be better than our current position.",
            "In the United States, it's clear that gender-based discrimination still persists in various aspects of society. While this issue affects both men and women, women often face significant challenges due to the 'glass ceiling' that hinders them from achieving equality. Women may have the qualifications and skills required for a particular position, but they may be overlooked for promotion simply because it's a historically male-dominated field, and society's biases are deeply ingrained. This is particularly evident in industries like business, where women are often expected to be subordinate to men.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations can also affect men who choose to stay at home and care for their children. Men who take on this role are often looked down upon and viewed as unconventional, as traditional societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for men who choose to defy these expectations.\n\nIn other industries, such as fashion, men who are interested in the field may face skepticism and prejudice due to societal stereotypes. For instance, men who work in fashion may be doubted and scrutinized simply because they are men, and people may question their understanding of the industry. However, this is beginning to change as people become more accepting and open-minded.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote awareness and understanding of the qualities and strengths of individuals who have traditionally been marginalized. Rather than forcing change, it's crucial to encourage a more nuanced and inclusive approach that celebrates diversity and challenges societal norms. By promoting acceptance and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nFurthermore, it's also essential to recognize that discrimination can occur within the same gender, depending on factors like education, background, or geographic location. For example, individuals from rural areas with limited access to education may face prejudice from those from more affluent areas who have had better opportunities. This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address inequality.",
            "My understanding is that by decriminalizing marijuana, it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where individuals are issued a citation rather than facing arrest and prosecution. This change can have significant long-term implications, such as affecting job prospects and other opportunities, which are often the most critical consequences of a drug charge. However, proponents of decriminalization argue that the cost of enforcing strict marijuana laws is substantial, including the expenses associated with arrest, booking, and court proceedings. This is particularly relevant for cash-strapped municipalities that may not have the financial resources to pursue such measures, even if it would ultimately save them money in the long run.\n\nIn places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization seems like a viable option. By decriminalizing marijuana, these cities can redirect the funds previously spent on enforcement towards more pressing issues, such as education, social programs, and assistance for the homeless. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use, including its impact on motor skills and overall lifestyle. While some argue that marijuana has a more significant influence on people's behavior, others claim that alcohol has a more detrimental effect on motor skills. Ultimately, individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of negative consequences.",
            "I would agree with this assessment.  The Catholic Church often adheres to traditional practices, which can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability.  However, it's equally crucial for the church to be open to change and adapt to the evolving needs of its members. \n\nSome people believe that the church's rigid adherence to its doctrine can lead to exclusivity and intolerance, particularly towards those who do not conform to Catholic teachings or belong to other faiths.  For instance, my family's experience showed that the church would not perform a marriage between two individuals from different denominations, despite the importance of love and acceptance.\n\nThis sense of hypocrisy can be disheartening, as the Catholic Church preaches love and compassion but fails to live up to these values in practice.  It's puzzling that the church clings to outdated practices, failing to recognize the need for reform.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it could be beneficial, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of child abuse.  Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be directly linked to marital status.  It's likely that individuals who engage in such behavior would continue to do so regardless of their marital status. \n\nIn conclusion, it's essential for the church to balance tradition and modernity, as well as to focus on creating a more inclusive environment that promotes love, acceptance, and compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue, and I don't have a strong opinion on whether one side is right or wrong. However, I believe that this topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between the separation of church and state, as well as defining what constitutes a marriage. It's difficult to approach this topic without offending someone or group.\n\nIn my opinion, all marriages should be viewed as civil unions, regardless of whether they are considered sacraments or not. This is because marriage is essentially a union between two individuals, and the government shouldn't intervene in matters that are typically considered personal and private. If two people decide to enter into a union, they should be treated equally under the law, without any additional scrutiny based on their religious affiliations.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, it's really just about two individuals forming a union, and they should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as anyone else in a civil union. I think it's unnecessary for states to come to a consensus on this issue and then push for federal legislation, as it's not a significant enough concern to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn fact, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it's a matter that affects a relatively small group of people. The constitution should not be changed to accommodate a minority view, especially when it doesn't align with the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our country is built upon.\n\nIn summary, the issue of gay marriage is not significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's best to view all marriages as civil unions, without any additional considerations based on religious beliefs or affiliations.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household had a complex impact on my views on homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I might not fully agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I believe the decision should be left to individual states rather than being imposed by the federal government. \n\nThis approach makes sense, considering the diverse views within different states, with many being democratic and others more conservative. In a democratic state, residents likely support gay marriage, and it's reasonable to accept their decision if they choose to legalize it. By living in a particular state, individuals implicitly agree to abide by its laws and policies.\n\nI believe individuals of all orientations should have equal opportunities, and it's only fair that each state has the autonomy to decide on the issue of gay marriage. It's not up to the federal government, such as a president, to dictate the laws of every state. A president, like Bush, should not have the authority to impose their views on the entire nation, especially if they don't live in every state and will eventually leave office.\n\nUltimately, I think certain decisions should be left to the discretion of individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices. This approach would prevent a constant back-and-forth on the issue, with decisions being reversed by subsequent administrations. By giving states the freedom to decide, we can respect their unique perspectives and allow them to create laws that work best for their residents.",
            "The speaker begins by acknowledging that social media platforms like Myspace are public spaces where users post content for others to see. They argue that if a student posts something on Myspace, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, even if it's not under the school's official name, because they could still access it from home. The speaker believes that school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, which includes monitoring potential threats, such as student behavior that could lead to a school shooting.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that monitoring students' online activities can be an invasion of privacy. They draw a distinction between monitoring student behavior that's intended to catch students doing something wrong and monitoring that's aimed at preventing harm or making the school a safer place. The speaker suggests that the latter is acceptable, even if it means school officials are accessing private online content.\n\nThe speaker compares this to a lockdown drill, which is a measure implemented to ensure student safety, particularly in the wake of a terrorist attack. They see school officials' actions in this case as a similar attempt to prevent harm and make the school a safer place. The speaker concludes that, in their opinion, it's reasonable for school officials to monitor student online activities if it's done to prevent harm and maintain a safe environment.\n\nThe speaker also notes that once content is posted online, it's difficult to control who sees it, and it can come back to haunt the poster in the future. They suggest that students should be cautious when posting online, anticipating that their content may be discovered and used against them.\n\nOverall, the speaker's opinion is that school officials' actions were justified in this case, as they were aimed at preventing harm and maintaining a safe environment for students.",
            "Initially, I had strong support for going to war after 9/11, as it was a personal and emotional issue for me. However, I soon realized that we were not adequately prepared and lacked a clear plan for the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that our decision to invade was driven more by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a well-thought-out strategy. As a result, our involvement in the war ultimately backfired, and we failed to achieve our goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in that region are so consumed by internal conflicts that they cannot possibly focus on fighting against us. It's almost as if they're fighting a war within themselves, and it's pointless for us to try to impose our will on them. I've come to a point where I've lost interest in the situation, and I don't think it's our place to try to change them.\n\nOne of the main problems with our approach was that we didn't fully understand the culture and mindset of the people we were fighting against. War is a vastly different concept for them than it is for us, and it's often driven by tribal and primal instincts rather than a desire to build a better country.\n\nI think we were initially driven by a desire for revenge and a sense of moral duty, rather than a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I can understand his motivations, I think we could have handled the situation differently. We could have taken a more measured approach, with a clear plan and a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, our lack of unity and planning led to a series of costly mistakes. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and our actions only created more chaos and divisions. I believe that we're not equipped to change the people in that region, and they will likely always be driven by their own internal conflicts.\n\nI think it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the war and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the costs and sacrifices we're making. In the end, I believe that our continued presence will only lead to further instability, and it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties handle their own affairs."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on several issues in order to prevent a decline in its following. One possible reason for this decline is the church's rigidity on certain topics, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, which may be perceived as outdated by some. By adapting to a more modern perspective, the church may be able to retain its followers who feel alienated by its conservative views. \n\nMany people are beginning to question the Catholic Church's stance on these issues and may choose not to follow the church if they disagree with its teachings. For instance, individuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable belonging to a community that views these practices as morally wrong. Similarly, people who value personal freedom and autonomy may be put off by the church's strict views on these matters.\n\nThe Catholic Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is another area where some may see the institution as out of touch. It's hard to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have prevented past scandals, but it's clear that these issues are not necessarily linked. Nevertheless, it's reasonable to question why the church bars priests from marrying and having a family life, especially when many other professionals are able to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\nThe church's argument that priests are married to God and devoted to their spiritual calling doesn't necessarily justify its stance on marriage and family life. In reality, most people have multiple commitments and responsibilities, and it's not unreasonable to expect priests to have a similar balance in their lives.",
            "Personally, I don't object to same-sex marriage. It's my opinion that people's sexual orientation isn't something they consciously choose, so it's unfair to hold them accountable for it. Therefore, I believe it's wrong to deny marriage rights to couples of the same sex while allowing heterosexual couples to marry. I haven't given much thought to the issue, but I firmly believe that this discrimination is unjust.\n\nIt seems that sexual orientation isn't a matter of personal choice, as people are born with their natural inclinations. I was born straight, and others are born gay – it's just a natural aspect of who they are. I don't think they should be blamed or held accountable for their orientation.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not be involved in this issue, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's a personal matter that doesn't concern the government. I don't think it's right for them to intervene in people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal relationships and identities.\n\nUltimately, people should be free to be who they are without fear of persecution or judgment. The government's involvement in this issue seems out of place and unnecessary. Gay people are not responsible for their orientation, and they shouldn't be punished for it. They should be treated with respect and equality, just like anyone else.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people think that gay couples threaten the traditional family, but they are simply two different sides of the same coin, with their own unique characteristics. The notion that gay couples are a threat is unfounded and lacks evidence. \n\nResearch has shown that gay couples fare similarly to straight couples in terms of relationship satisfaction, and they have the same fundamental needs and desires. They're not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather for a legal document that acknowledges their union, which is a civil matter, not a religious one. \n\nThe argument that allowing gay marriage would lead to the erosion of traditional values is a weak one. It's similar to saying that civil rights for African Americans or women would lead to the downfall of society. The idea that gay people are morally flawed or that their sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception that has been disproven by scientific studies. \n\nThe opposition to gay marriage is often rooted in ignorance and a lack of understanding. People's moral compasses may vary, but it's unfair to impose one group's morality on the entire country. Moreover, it's hypocritical for politicians to push for laws that enforce their own moral standards without considering the perspectives of others.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a choice. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims. It's essential to rely on research and evidence rather than anecdotal opinions or popular culture.\n\nUltimately, I think the federal government should take a more progressive stance on this issue and legalize gay marriage across the country. The idea that the government should intervene in personal relationships and dictate who can or cannot get married is a flawed one. It's time for us to move forward and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "To clarify my stance on the availability of certain substances, I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand the benefits of using controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, which are often misunderstood due to their legal status. Conversely, I believe that just because marijuana is illegal, it doesn't necessarily mean it lacks beneficial properties. In fact, if its medicinal uses are acknowledged, it could be a valuable treatment option for patients.\n\nWhile it's true that abusing any substance can lead to negative consequences, the comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely accurate. However, a more gradual introduction of marijuana into the legal system might mitigate potential abuse. The primary issue lies in the stigma surrounding marijuana, which is often fueled by its illegality. By reevaluating this stigma and understanding that marijuana is not as detrimental as other illicit substances like heroin or cocaine, we may be able to encourage responsible use, particularly for medicinal purposes.\n\nBy removing the negative image associated with marijuana, people may become more inclined to use it responsibly, and its benefits can be harnessed for the greater good. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to marijuana's regulation could lead to a better understanding of its potential and its place in healthcare.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the modern era, and its strictness has decreased over time. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed that the atmosphere and dress code have become more casual. In my younger days, I would wear matching dresses and accessories, but now I see people attending in beachwear and casual clothing, even on Sundays. The church has introduced a shorter mass for teenagers, lasting only thirty minutes, and people generally dress down, especially during the summer months.\n\nAs I reflect on the church I know, I don't have insight into its internal politics, but I do think it has become more relaxed. However, I don't believe allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented the scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church. Pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with these inclinations. While some people might try to suppress their desires, they often resurface. Therefore, I don't think the church's rules regarding marriage for priests would have made a difference.\n\nIt's essential to note that even married individuals with children can still develop pedophilic tendencies. Thus, I think it's more about the individual's inherent nature rather than their marital status. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might consider a different denomination that allows for this. The Catholic Church's stance on this matter might not be the root cause of the problem.\n\nIn my opinion, if the church was aware of and intentionally covered up these issues, that's a different story, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules could have prevented these incidents from occurring. If anything, I think it's essential to acknowledge that pedophilia is a complex issue linked to genetics and that marriage or the lack thereof is not a determining factor.",
            "I initially had reservations about the premise of the Iraq War, particularly because it came on the heels of the September 11th attacks. I believe the Bush administration used the war as a pretext, linking it to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, claims that have since been proven false. This deception has been deeply disturbing to me, and the Iraq War continues to evoke strong emotions. \n\nThe Bush administration's transparent lies to the American people, as evidenced by Colin Powell's later admissions that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN, are a serious offense that undermines the principles of democratic governance. The administration's disregard for the Constitution and its attempts to erode it since 9/11 are equally concerning. It appears that the Bush administration had planned to go to war from the outset, driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy supply.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, withdrawing now could lead to further chaos and bloodshed. The UN and the US are considering a coalition of regional nations to maintain order, but I'm skeptical about this plan, as it may ultimately undermine Iraq's sovereignty. The current interim government is ineffective, with a dysfunctional Parliament and a lack of control from the Prime Minister. The presence of radical elements, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which now holds significant power, is exacerbating the political instability.",
            "The speaker has mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They struggle to articulate their thoughts, initially stating that they feel it's pointless due to the fact that it was not officially declared as a war by Congress. They suggest that the US invaded Iraq as a form of retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, which they believe was a primary motivation for the conflict. The speaker is uncertain about the reasons for the US presence in Iraq, citing the possibility of trying to build democracy and gain access to oil resources as potential justifications. However, they argue that these reasons are not sufficient, as the war has led to widespread unrest and destruction in the region.\n\nThe speaker also expresses concerns about the long-term consequences of the war, including the potential for the US to try to impose its own system of government on Iraq, which could exacerbate the situation. They worry that the US presence will fuel the growth of anti-American sentiment, particularly among extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the speaker suggests that the war should continue, but not be referred to as a war, as it was not officially declared by Congress. They imply that the US is using military force to assert its power and dominance rather than to address a legitimate threat. However, this stance is later complicated by the speaker's empathy for families affected by the war, including those with loved ones serving in Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the war in Iraq is a complex and multifaceted issue, with no clear solution in sight. They predict that the conflict will continue for years to come, with uncertain outcomes and unintended consequences.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for states to legalize or declare it as permissible. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, seems to suggest that this decision should be left to individual churches. The attempts to impose laws that restrict certain church activities appear to defy the principles established by the constitution.\n\nWhen considering those pushing for it to be made illegal, I believe it's essentially favoring one church's beliefs over another. Many Catholics and Christians are opposed to it, except in a few areas like Boston. I don't think it's the government's role to dictate which activities are allowed or prohibited by the churches.\n\nThe principle of separation of church and state has been a core aspect of the US constitution, promoting religious tolerance. Proposing an amendment that restricts religious freedom, as I see it, contradicts the existing constitution. Moreover, such an amendment could be one of the few that restricts individual rights rather than limiting government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government and any government should not be involved in this matter. The president's push for the amendment seems to be driven by his own personal beliefs, rather than a genuine need for a policy change. His actions suggest a preference for one religion over others, which I believe is unfair.\n\nThere's little justification for this amendment, aside from personal opinions. I don't see how it would negatively impact the economy, and it could potentially have a positive impact on society. In conclusion, I think this decision should be left to individual churches, not the government.",
            "The Iraq war is a topic that raises many concerns about the honesty of the government towards the American people. Prior to the invasion, there are doubts that the government was transparent about the reasons for going to war. The link between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 terrorist attacks was overstated, and the government exploited the emotions of the American people to justify the invasion. This occurred in 2003, a time when the US was still reeling from the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAs someone who generally opposes war, especially a preemptive strike, I believe that the Iraq war has many parallels with the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes and been better prepared for the consequences of removing a country's government and replacing it with a democratic one. The aftermath of the invasion was chaotic, and the US government was not adequately prepared to deal with the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe goal of installing a democratic government in Iraq was similar to the US's attempt to do the same in Vietnam, but it ultimately led to a protracted and difficult conflict. The US government underestimated the number of insurgents that would resist the occupation, and fighting a war against a nation's citizens is a far more challenging task than fighting a conventional army.\n\nIf the US government is to engage in a war, it must be better prepared for all possible outcomes. In the case of Iraq, the US government was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the country is still experiencing instability and violence. The training of Iraqi security forces and police has been a long and arduous process.\n\nFurthermore, the US government's portrayal of the war as a short and successful endeavor was misleading. Implementing a new form of government and establishing a stable democracy takes time, and the US should not have underestimated the complexity of the task. The US government's actions in Iraq have been criticized for being naive and based on a simplistic understanding of how to establish a democratic government.\n\nThe decision to go to war in Iraq was a difficult one, and it is hard to justify abandoning a country that the US had intervened in. However, the human cost of the war, including the number of American casualties, is a significant concern. The motivations behind the invasion, including the desire to control Iraq's oil resources, have also been questioned.\n\nThe fact that the US government has not taken similar action against other countries with similar issues, such as North Korea, which was known to possess weapons of mass destruction, has raised questions about the US government's decision-making process. Ultimately, the Iraq war has been a complex and multifaceted issue, and its legacy continues to be felt today.\n\nIn the end, the war in Iraq is a reminder of the importance of transparency and thoroughness in the decision-making process, and the need for the US government to be honest with the American people about the reasons for going to war. While it is hoped that the conflict will come to an end soon, the reality is that it may take much longer for the country to achieve stability and peace.",
            "I'd like to express my support for gay marriage. In my opinion, it's a personal preference and not a matter that should be influenced by societal or external factors. Research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological component, rather than being determined by upbringing or societal norms. I believe it's inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something they cannot control.\n\nI think the government and politics should not interfere with personal matters, including marriage. Marriage is a personal and private decision that should be made by individuals, not the government. In fact, I've seen many gay couples in my neighborhood who lead normal, functioning lives, just like any other family. It's absurd to allow politicians to impose their own interpretations of marriage on others.\n\nScientific studies have also shown that there may be a biological basis for homosexuality, rather than it being a result of environmental factors. For example, research has identified specific chemical differences in the brain that may influence an individual's sexual orientation.\n\nWhile there are some who may argue against gay marriage, I believe it's essential to recognize that it's a personal choice and not something that should be subject to public scrutiny. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married without informing anyone, they can do so without it being a major news event. However, when a same-sex couple tries to do the same, it becomes a public spectacle. In my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public issue that's subject to federal or national attention.",

School officials have a responsibility to act on such information, even if it's difficult to determine what's serious and what's not.\n\nIn reality, the internet offers little to no privacy, so it's crucial to be mindful of what you share online. If you don't want something to be public, don't post it. You can't control how others perceive you or what they take seriously. School officials should not friend students on social media platforms, as this can blur the lines of their roles and create an invasion of students' privacy. However, if concerns are brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to act. It's a different matter if they're monitoring private communications, but if students share information publicly, it's a different story.\n\nFor example, as a Resident Advisor, I wouldn't create a social media account under a different name to friend students, as this would compromise their trust and make it difficult for me to maintain professional boundaries. Instead, I'd rather not have that connection and avoid being privy to sensitive information that might require my attention.",
            "The war has dragged on for far too long, and its original purpose seems to have been lost in the process. Initially, the intention was to restore democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, which would be a valid reason to intervene, but it's questionable whether personal interests, such as resolving past conflicts with Saddam Hussein, played a role. \n\nIf the primary goal was to establish democracy, it would have been a justifiable reason, but it appears that the motives have shifted over time. The war's initial impact, which was evident in the first few months, was significant, as it made a bold statement. However, the prolonged duration of the war, spanning over a year or several years, has made it clear that the goal has been compromised.\n\nThe original intention of promoting democracy in a country ruled by a tyrant is a legitimate reason for going to war. Nevertheless, the war has lost its purpose and has become a self-sustaining entity. The desire to achieve a decisive victory or avoid defeat has led to further conflict. It's time for the country's government to take responsibility for its own affairs.\n\nThe war has been costly, with billions of dollars being spent, which could be better allocated to address domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, public education, and healthcare. It's illogical to prioritize funding a foreign war when these pressing issues demand attention. The money being spent could be more effectively used to improve the lives of citizens at home, rather than sacrificing lives in a foreign war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "To clarify, I'd like to ask if you're saying that a life was saved because someone discovered some information online that prevented a potentially threatening situation. I understand that when you share information on the internet, you're essentially making it available for anyone to see. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, you have to accept others as friends, which implies giving them permission to view your profile. \n\nThis raises questions about the balance between online safety and invasion of privacy. While it's impractical to have someone monitor all students' profiles, it's also problematic if schools are only focusing on certain individuals. However, if someone is actively searching for information, it's a different story. The concern then becomes whether they're genuinely looking for evidence of potential threats or just browsing randomly.\n\nPersonally, I'm uneasy about sharing personal details online, even though I have a Facebook account. I've seen examples of people exploiting social media for malicious purposes. For instance, someone might use a person's screen name and instant messaging to deceive them into meeting. This raises concerns about online safety and the potential for stalking.\n\nI've tried to limit what I share on social media, but it's hard to strike a balance between being cautious and being able to connect with friends. It's difficult to know who can access your information, even if you only accept people you know.\n\nI recall hearing about a story where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts. It struck me as unusual, and I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what students could or couldn't have online. It's a complex issue, and I'm not sure if it's a matter of privacy or something else entirely.",
            "There's a certain irony in discussing the Iraq War, given my own stance on the matter. I hesitate to join those who claim to have been against it from the beginning, as I was indeed opposed to it, but I don't think it's as significant now, considering the widespread consensus that the war was a bad idea, except within the administration. Looking at recent polls from the US, Iraq, and globally, it's clear that a significant majority of the world's population, around 75-80%, views the war as a mistake. Notably, 80% of Iraqis and 70% of US troops in the region believe that the war was a poor decision and that the US should withdraw within a year. \n\nThe situation in Iraq was already a disaster before the US involvement, and the situation has only worsened since. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries create significant barriers to understanding and resolving issues in the region. It's unrealistic to expect democracy to be easily imposed on a culture that might not naturally adopt it. Although Saddam was a bad leader, weighing the pros and cons of invading a country that would likely become a disaster was crucial. \n\nGiven the circumstances, it's challenging to see a compelling reason to stay in Iraq. The administration might have some optimistic ideas about the benefits of staying, but I haven't heard a convincing argument for it. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or a bit longer, I wouldn't have a major issue with that. However, I struggle to see why we shouldn't leave now, especially considering that a significant number of Iraqis – including those we're trying to help – want us to leave within the year or immediately. If we ask them and they tell us to leave, it would be clearer that the responsibility for any negative outcome wouldn't lie with the US. \n\nIf we were to leave, we might at least be seen as trying to do the right thing, rather than perpetuating the current problematic situation. Although we'll never be seen as the \"good guys\" in the Middle East, it would be better than our current position.",
            "In the United States, it's clear that gender-based discrimination still persists in various aspects of society. While this issue affects both men and women, women often face significant challenges due to the 'glass ceiling' that hinders them from achieving equality. Women may have the qualifications and skills required for a particular position, but they may be overlooked for promotion simply because it's a historically male-dominated field, and society's biases are deeply ingrained. This is particularly evident in industries like business, where women are often expected to be subordinate to men.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations can also affect men who choose to stay at home and care for their children. Men who take on this role are often looked down upon and viewed as unconventional, as traditional societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for men who choose to defy these expectations.\n\nIn other industries, such as fashion, men who are interested in the field may face skepticism and prejudice due to societal stereotypes. For instance, men who work in fashion may be doubted and scrutinized simply because they are men, and people may question their understanding of the industry. However, this is beginning to change as people become more accepting and open-minded.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote awareness and understanding of the qualities and strengths of individuals who have traditionally been marginalized. Rather than forcing change, it's crucial to encourage a more nuanced and inclusive approach that celebrates diversity and challenges societal norms. By promoting acceptance and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.\n\nFurthermore, it's also essential to recognize that discrimination can occur within the same gender, depending on factors like education, background, or geographic location. For example, individuals from rural areas with limited access to education may face prejudice from those from more affluent areas who have had better opportunities. This highlights the complexity of the issue and the need for a multifaceted approach to address inequality.",
            "My understanding is that by decriminalizing marijuana, it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where individuals are issued a citation rather than facing arrest and prosecution. This change can have significant long-term implications, such as affecting job prospects and other opportunities, which are often the most critical consequences of a drug charge. However, proponents of decriminalization argue that the cost of enforcing strict marijuana laws is substantial, including the expenses associated with arrest, booking, and court proceedings. This is particularly relevant for cash-strapped municipalities that may not have the financial resources to pursue such measures, even if it would ultimately save them money in the long run.\n\nIn places like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization seems like a viable option. By decriminalizing marijuana, these cities can redirect the funds previously spent on enforcement towards more pressing issues, such as education, social programs, and assistance for the homeless. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the potential effects of widespread marijuana use, including its impact on motor skills and overall lifestyle. While some argue that marijuana has a more significant influence on people's behavior, others claim that alcohol has a more detrimental effect on motor skills. Ultimately, individual reactions to substances can vary greatly, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of negative consequences.",
            "I would agree with this assessment.  The Catholic Church often adheres to traditional practices, which can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability.  However, it's equally crucial for the church to be open to change and adapt to the evolving needs of its members. \n\nSome people believe that the church's rigid adherence to its doctrine can lead to exclusivity and intolerance, particularly towards those who do not conform to Catholic teachings or belong to other faiths.  For instance, my family's experience showed that the church would not perform a marriage between two individuals from different denominations, despite the importance of love and acceptance.\n\nThis sense of hypocrisy can be disheartening, as the Catholic Church preaches love and compassion but fails to live up to these values in practice.  It's puzzling that the church clings to outdated practices, failing to recognize the need for reform.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it could be beneficial, but it might not necessarily prevent instances of child abuse.  Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be directly linked to marital status.  It's likely that individuals who engage in such behavior would continue to do so regardless of their marital status. \n\nIn conclusion, it's essential for the church to balance tradition and modernity, as well as to focus on creating a more inclusive environment that promotes love, acceptance, and compassion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue, and I don't have a strong opinion on whether one side is right or wrong. However, I believe that this topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between the separation of church and state, as well as defining what constitutes a marriage. It's difficult to approach this topic without offending someone or group.\n\nIn my opinion, all marriages should be viewed as civil unions, regardless of whether they are considered sacraments or not. This is because marriage is essentially a union between two individuals, and the government shouldn't intervene in matters that are typically considered personal and private. If two people decide to enter into a union, they should be treated equally under the law, without any additional scrutiny based on their religious affiliations.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, it's really just about two individuals forming a union, and they should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as anyone else in a civil union. I think it's unnecessary for states to come to a consensus on this issue and then push for federal legislation, as it's not a significant enough concern to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn fact, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it's a matter that affects a relatively small group of people. The constitution should not be changed to accommodate a minority view, especially when it doesn't align with the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our country is built upon.\n\nIn summary, the issue of gay marriage is not significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's best to view all marriages as civil unions, without any additional considerations based on religious beliefs or affiliations.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household had a complex impact on my views on homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I might not fully agree with the lifestyle, I do think it should be legalized. I believe the decision should be left to individual states rather than being imposed by the federal government. \n\nThis approach makes sense, considering the diverse views within different states, with many being democratic and others more conservative. In a democratic state, residents likely support gay marriage, and it's reasonable to accept their decision if they choose to legalize it. By living in a particular state, individuals implicitly agree to abide by its laws and policies.\n\nI believe individuals of all orientations should have equal opportunities, and it's only fair that each state has the autonomy to decide on the issue of gay marriage. It's not up to the federal government, such as a president, to dictate the laws of every state. A president, like Bush, should not have the authority to impose their views on the entire nation, especially if they don't live in every state and will eventually leave office.\n\nUltimately, I think certain decisions should be left to the discretion of individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices. This approach would prevent a constant back-and-forth on the issue, with decisions being reversed by subsequent administrations. By giving states the freedom to decide, we can respect their unique perspectives and allow them to create laws that work best for their residents.",
            "The speaker begins by acknowledging that social media platforms like Myspace are public spaces where users post content for others to see. They argue that if a student posts something on Myspace, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, even if it's not under the school's official name, because they could still access it from home. The speaker believes that school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe environment, which includes monitoring potential threats, such as student behavior that could lead to a school shooting.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that monitoring students' online activities can be an invasion of privacy. They draw a distinction between monitoring student behavior that's intended to catch students doing something wrong and monitoring that's aimed at preventing harm or making the school a safer place. The speaker suggests that the latter is acceptable, even if it means school officials are accessing private online content.\n\nThe speaker compares this to a lockdown drill, which is a measure implemented to ensure student safety, particularly in the wake of a terrorist attack. They see school officials' actions in this case as a similar attempt to prevent harm and make the school a safer place. The speaker concludes that, in their opinion, it's reasonable for school officials to monitor student online activities if it's done to prevent harm and maintain a safe environment.\n\nThe speaker also notes that once content is posted online, it's difficult to control who sees it, and it can come back to haunt the poster in the future. They suggest that students should be cautious when posting online, anticipating that their content may be discovered and used against them.\n\nOverall, the speaker's opinion is that school officials' actions were justified in this case, as they were aimed at preventing harm and maintaining a safe environment for students.",
            "Initially, I had strong support for going to war after 9/11, as it was a personal and emotional issue for me. However, I soon realized that we were not adequately prepared and lacked a clear plan for the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that our decision to invade was driven more by emotions and a desire for revenge rather than a well-thought-out strategy. As a result, our involvement in the war ultimately backfired, and we failed to achieve our goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in that region are so consumed by internal conflicts that they cannot possibly focus on fighting against us. It's almost as if they're fighting a war within themselves, and it's pointless for us to try to impose our will on them. I've come to a point where I've lost interest in the situation, and I don't think it's our place to try to change them.\n\nOne of the main problems with our approach was that we didn't fully understand the culture and mindset of the people we were fighting against. War is a vastly different concept for them than it is for us, and it's often driven by tribal and primal instincts rather than a desire to build a better country.\n\nI think we were initially driven by a desire for revenge and a sense of moral duty, rather than a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I can understand his motivations, I think we could have handled the situation differently. We could have taken a more measured approach, with a clear plan and a better understanding of the local dynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, our lack of unity and planning led to a series of costly mistakes. We didn't have a clear idea of what we were trying to achieve, and our actions only created more chaos and divisions. I believe that we're not equipped to change the people in that region, and they will likely always be driven by their own internal conflicts.\n\nI think it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the war and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify the costs and sacrifices we're making. In the end, I believe that our continued presence will only lead to further instability, and it's time for us to withdraw and let the local parties handle their own affairs."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several ways, the Catholic Church may need to evolve in order to maintain its influence. The Church's strict views on certain issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, may be a major reason behind its declining following. These views are rooted in traditional teachings, but they often conflict with modern perspectives and values. \n\nAs a result, some people are starting to drift away from the Church, finding its stance on these issues to be outdated and out of touch. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable following a Church that condemns these practices, and people who believe in these rights may not want to be part of a community that teaches that they are wrong.\n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and priests' marital status is another point of contention. While the Church views priests as being married to God, this concept is not necessarily relatable to the general population, where work and family life often go hand-in-hand. It's difficult to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have altered the Church's stance on certain issues, but it's possible that it could have made the Church more relatable and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church may need to adapt its stance on these issues to avoid further alienating its followers and to stay relevant in modern society. By embracing a more inclusive and accepting attitude, the Church may be able to reclaim its influence and appeal to people who feel that its current views are no longer aligned with their values.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any objections to same-sex marriage. People who identify as gay aren't making a conscious decision about their sexual orientation; it's just who they are. Therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual identity. It's unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married when a man and a woman can. Upon reflection, I believe it's morally wrong to make such distinctions.\n\nIt's clear that a person's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born gay, just as others are born straight. This inherent aspect of a person's identity shouldn't be used to justify denying them their rights. In this context, I strongly disagree with holding gay individuals accountable for their sexual orientation.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the federal government shouldn't have a say in this matter. It's not a matter of national security or moral principles, but rather a personal issue that affects individuals. The government has no right to interfere in people's personal lives and dictate their relationships.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals are who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for their natural identity. The government should respect their autonomy and not impose its authority in matters that have no bearing on national security or societal morals.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people assume that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, but this notion is misguided. Gay relationships are distinct and diverse, and they shouldn't be judged solely based on comparisons to heterosexual relationships. It's essential to recognize that gay couples face various civil rights issues, such as unequal access to healthcare and property rights, which are often tied to the concept of marriage.\n\nFor instance, gay partners are often excluded from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and making important decisions on their behalf, simply because they're not considered family. This is unreasonable, especially considering that many gay couples are in long-term, committed relationships. Studies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples, suggesting that their relationships are not inherently different.\n\nThe core issue is not about church involvement, but rather about recognizing the right to a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government. If civil unions are permitted, why not marriage? It's like comparing segregation to inequality – they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nSome people worry about the impact of gay couples on communities and the potential effects on children, but these concerns are often unfounded. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are not disproportionately affected, and they face many of the same challenges as children from heterosexual families. The main issue is not the orientation of their parents, but rather the way society treats them.\n\nIn fact, children from gay families often face bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can lead to serious problems. It's essential to recognize that parenting skills and values are not determined by a couple's sexual orientation. Ultimately, it's about treating people with respect and equality, regardless of their relationships.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in promoting gay marriage rights, and the proposed amendment banning it is misguided. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, like his views on abortion and stem cell research, may be influenced by his personal beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the entire nation.\n\nThe government should not impose its moral views on the population, especially when they contradict the values of other citizens. It's hypocritical to enforce laws based on certain religious groups' beliefs without considering the broader cultural and moral implications. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights this issue.\n\nSome people's opposition to gay marriage stems from misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as trauma or personality defects. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, and it's essential to rely on scientific research rather than popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Many people assume that because a substance is illegal, it must be entirely devoid of benefits. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While I think making a substance available to the general public is a different story, I believe it should be considered for medicinal purposes. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are proven to be beneficial. The fact that marijuana is illegal should not hinder its potential benefits. If we can accept the advantages of these controlled substances, then we should do the same for marijuana. \n\nThe comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely relevant since marijuana can be abused, but so can alcohol. A more effective approach might be to legalize marijuana gradually, removing the existing stigma around it. This could encourage people to use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. \n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems from its illicit status. However, it is not as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the image of marijuana as a harmless substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially when it comes to medical applications.",
            "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by genetics, and it's not a result of their upbringing or environment. Thus, it's unlikely that the church's rules on marriage or priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these cases.\n\nIf the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue, and they should be held accountable. However, if they were genuinely unaware, then it's not the church's policies that are to blame.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other specific comments to add beyond these observations.",
            "(laughs) \nInitially, I was somewhat accepting of the Iraq war's premise, but I think the September 11th attacks had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, and the Bush administration used that as a pretext to invade Iraq, which I believe was not the primary reason for the invasion. The administration incorrectly linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This has left a lasting impression on me, as it is a clear example of the Bush administration's willingness to deceive the American people.\n\nIt's my opinion that the Bush administration has been remarkably transparent in its dishonesty towards the American public, and has yet to accept responsibility for these actions. Not even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now admits that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. I believe this behavior is a severe breach of duty and constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, I think the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the US Constitution and attempted to marginalize it since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe younger Bush administration's intentions to go to war seem to have been premeditated, with some even suggesting that he sought revenge for his father's administration. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his book, alleged that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and was also driven by a desire to expand the US energy supply. This is a highly underhanded approach to governance.\n\nWhile I believe the Iraq war has gone on for far too long, an immediate withdrawal would likely lead to chaos and further bloodshed, given the risk of civil war. The UN and US are now exploring an alternative solution, involving a coalition of surrounding nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, I have doubts about this approach, as it may ultimately lead to issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, particularly given the ineffectiveness of the current interim government and the power struggles within the Parliament.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is dysfunctional, with the Prime Minister lacking control over the political process, and extremist elements vying for power. The presence of radical groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds significant seats in the Parliament, adds to the chaos and friction in the Iraqi political process.\n\nI struggle to articulate my concerns in polite company, but it's clear that the Iraq war has been a catastrophic failure and a grave mistake.",
            "The speaker expresses their thoughts on the War in Iraq, starting with a general sense of confusion and lack of knowledge about the conflict. They mention that the war was not officially declared by Congress and that it appears to be motivated by a desire to exact revenge against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the war's primary goal is to establish a democracy in Iraq, which they believe is unrealistic and would require a significant amount of time and resources. They also express concerns that the war is causing harm to the Iraqi people, displacing children and disrupting their education and daily lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker is conflicted about their opinions on the war. On one hand, they feel a sense of responsibility to support the soldiers fighting in Iraq, particularly those from families they know. On the other hand, they worry that the US presence in Iraq is perpetuating a cycle of violence and hatred towards the US, and that it is ultimately counterproductive.\n\nThe speaker draws a parallel with the Vietnam War, which they believe was also an undeclared war that is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They express concerns that the US is repeating the same mistakes in Iraq, with the war becoming a long and costly endeavor that is damaging the country and its people.\n\nUltimately, the speaker is unsure about what to think about the war, acknowledging that it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. They suggest that the conflict will likely continue for many years to come, with no clear end in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to make it legal or illegal. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the United States. Allowing the government to decide what's permissible or not within churches would be a direct disregard for this fundamental principle. This would be especially concerning if the government were to enforce its own preferences over those of other faiths. \n\nThe fact that some denominations, such as Catholics and Christians, have different views on this issue highlights the importance of leaving it up to individual churches to decide. The government should not impose its authority over sensitive matters of faith, which is a core aspect of the Constitution. \n\nIn fact, attempting to pass an amendment to restrict this freedom would be contradictory to the Constitution's existing provisions and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't believe that the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue, especially when there's no clear reason for an amendment other than personal beliefs.\n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment on the economy or society is unclear, but it's possible that it could even have a positive effect. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not with the government or its officials, who may be promoting their own personal views rather than the greater good.",
            "The Iraq war raises several questions about the honesty of the government in its decision-making process.  It appears that the administration may not have been entirely transparent with the American public about the true reasons for the invasion. The link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated, and the government exploited the emotional response to the attacks to justify the war. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, opposed it, especially a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Iraq war bears similarities to the Vietnam War, which the government should have learned from. Many American lives were lost, and the removal of the Iraqi government created a power vacuum that the administration was not prepared to handle. The US aimed to establish a democratic government in Iraq, just as it had attempted to do in Vietnam by removing the communist regime. However, the US government should have anticipated the difficulties and complexities involved in this process.\n\nIn hindsight, the administration was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the occupation has been prolonged. The war has resulted in significant losses among American troops, and the training of Iraqi forces to maintain order has been a long and challenging process. The US government may have misled the public into believing that the invasion would be a relatively short and successful endeavor, which is not the case.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complex issue, and the decision to involve the country in a conflict is rarely straightforward. The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",
            "To be honest, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of who they are, and it's not something they can control. Scientific research has shown that it's likely linked to biology rather than societal factors. Considering this, it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something they can't change.\n\nI think it's essential to keep politics and government out of personal matters, particularly when it comes to something as intimate as marriage. It's a private decision that should be made at a personal or household level, not at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They participate in everyday activities, such as walking their dogs, and it's clear that they deserve the same rights as everyone else.\n\nI find it ridiculous when politicians try to impose their views on what marriage means. It's a chemical and biological aspect of human existence, and research suggests that people may be predisposed to being homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention, but gay couples face scrutiny and public debate. It's essential to treat marriage as a personal, private decision, rather than a matter of public interest or government policy.",

If you share sensitive or disturbing content, like threats or violent statements, it can be taken seriously and may lead to consequences.\n\nWhen something is posted online, it can spread quickly, and people may react based on what they see. In the case of a school, if someone reports a concerning post, administrators must act on it to ensure student safety. However, it can be challenging to determine what's a genuine threat and what's just a joke.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a recent situation at our school, where a student's online post was misinterpreted as a threat. After someone overheard a conversation and reported it, the school investigated and discovered the student's Facebook profile, which contained content that was initially meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone in the context of the situation.\n\nIt's essential to remember that once you post something online, there's no guarantee of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen or taken seriously, it's best not to post it in the first place. You can't control how others interpret your content or dictate what they should take seriously.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media or monitor their online activity, if a concerning post is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. However, I believe it's best not to have a personal connection with students online, as this can create a power imbalance and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I wouldn't create a fake social media account to connect with my residents, as this would blur the lines between our roles. Instead, I prefer to maintain a professional distance to avoid having to deal with sensitive or disturbing content that may arise from such a connection.",
            "I believe the war has been prolonged excessively, and its original intention to promote democracy has been lost sight of. While the initial goal of establishing a fair government in a country without one was commendable, it seems that personal vendettas, such as George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to go to war. \n\nIt's possible that the primary objective was achieved within the first few months, and the ongoing conflict has become a means to assert our nation's power rather than a genuine attempt to bring democracy to the region. The war has dragged on for far too long, and I think it's time for our military to disengage and allow the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. \n\nThe prolonged war has put a significant strain on our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's our duty to prioritize the needs of our own citizens and allocate our resources more effectively. The continued spending on a war that has lost its purpose is not only a drain on our economy but also a reminder of the devastating consequences of war, which should not be a long-term fixture in our national budget.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point by asking a question. The situation was potentially prevented because someone searched online and discovered that there was a risk. On platforms like Myspace, people post information that is accessible to anyone, as they are often public. The only way to access someone's profile is by becoming their friend, which implies that the person has given permission to see their information. Therefore, when someone posts on the internet, they should be aware that many people will see what they share. In this case, it's possible that someone's online activity was fortunate in preventing a serious situation.\n\nHowever, this raises some concerns. If one person is tasked with monitoring everyone's online activity, it could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals. It would be unfair to assume that only certain people are at risk and need to be monitored. The situation becomes even more complex when considering whether the person who found the online activity was specifically looking for potential threats or if it was just a coincidence.\n\nPersonally, I have concerns about online safety, as I know there are people who can access my information even without my consent. I had a disturbing experience watching a TV show where someone easily obtained a person's screen name and personal details online. This highlights the risks of sharing personal information online, even with controls in place. It's hard to balance the ease of communication with the need for safety and security.\n\nI've taken steps to limit what I share online, but I also don't want to restrict my online interactions too much. The issue is complex because I only accept people I know as friends online, but I'm not sure who else might be viewing my information.\n\nWhat struck me was a story my roommate shared about her high school experience, where students were banned from using Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what their students could or couldn't do online, and I don't know if that was a matter of privacy. That's the only other thought that comes to mind on this topic.",
            "There's an issue that I'd like to discuss, the Iraq War. It's a bit hypocritical of me to bring it up now, as I was initially against it, but I feel it's not as pressing anymore. The general consensus worldwide is that the invasion was a bad idea, except within the administration, where officials refuse to acknowledge their mistake. This is evident from recent polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, which show that approximately 75-80% of the world's population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq believe the war was a bad idea and that the US should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster since before the invasion, and withdrawal will likely be challenging as well. The main problem lies in the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries, making it difficult for the US administration to understand and adapt to the region's needs. The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "There's no doubt that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. When considering the issue, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not limited to women, but is also prevalent in various fields of work. Women often face unique challenges due to the so-called \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications and qualifications, they struggle to advance in their careers because of societal expectations and historical biases. This phenomenon is particularly evident when women are overlooked for promotions in favor of their male counterparts, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.\n\nHowever, the issue isn't exclusive to women. Men can also face discrimination, especially in industries like fashion, where societal norms dictate that men should not be interested in this field. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are often stereotyped and judged by society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and difficulty in pursuing their goals.\n\nMoreover, people from different regions or backgrounds may also face discrimination, not just based on their gender but also their geographical origins or socioeconomic status. For instance, individuals with non-standard grammar or speech patterns may be underestimated by their peers, even if they possess exceptional intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of the issue, where various factors can contribute to discrimination, including but not limited to, gender, location, and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address this issue, it's crucial to promote understanding and awareness of the diverse qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped and marginalized. Education and gradual exposure to different perspectives can help break down societal barriers and create a more inclusive environment. While change may be slow, it's essential to continue working towards a more equitable society, where individuals are judged based on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, background, or geographical location.\n\nBy fostering a culture of acceptance and promoting the value of different experiences and perspectives, we can work towards a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. This requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and stereotypes. While there may not be an immediate solution, gradual progress is possible, and it's essential to continue working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
            "In my understanding, marijuana was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a traffic ticket-worthy offense. This change reduces the severity of the consequences, such as avoiding arrest, booking, and court appearances. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term implications, like those associated with a drug charge, still exist. Although decriminalization can be beneficial, it's essential to consider the costs involved in arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals, which can be substantial. For financially struggling municipalities, the decision to decriminalize marijuana may be challenging, even if it could free up resources for other essential services.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded and liberal attitude, decriminalization is more acceptable. The financial benefits of decriminalization can be significant, allowing for investments in public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Nevertheless, there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of marijuana, such as its widespread availability and the potential for impaired driving. While marijuana may not have the same debilitating effects on motor skills as alcohol, it can still have a significant impact on people's lifestyles.\n\nInterestingly, people react differently to substances, and some are more prone to overindulgence, while others can exercise moderation. It's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, as individual reactions vary greatly. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, and a balanced approach to substance use is essential.",
            "I would say yes to some extent, however, there are certain concerns. A lot of traditional practices in the Catholic Church have been maintained for a long time, which is beneficial for grounding the institution. Nonetheless, it's also crucial for the Church to be adaptable to change. Unfortunately, this adaptability is not always evident.\n\nMany Catholics are expected to attend church regularly and adhere to strict rules, which can sometimes be perceived as judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. This intolerance can be seen in the fact that the Catholic Church doesn't accept individuals from other faiths or those who don't conform to its standards. For instance, my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to the latter's faith.\n\nThis disparity between the Church's teachings and its practices is puzzling. While Catholics are encouraged to love and accept others, the Church's actions often contradict this message, as seen in its treatment of people from other religions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of traditional practices in modern times.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it would be beneficial, but I'm not convinced it would prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilic behavior is a complex issue, and individuals who engage in it are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than focusing solely on the marital status of priests.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, and it's challenging to make a judgment without potentially offending someone. The issue of separating church and state, as well as defining marriage, is particularly delicate. I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed in a specific way by the government, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some. Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider it a civil union, which is essentially a union between two individuals. This way, the government wouldn't need to delve into the specifics of the marriage, such as whether it was performed by the church or not.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among states, it would be beneficial to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage is unwarranted, as it's not a significant enough issue to alter the Constitution. The Constitution should only be amended for fundamental, widely-held concerns, not for a cause that doesn't have broad enough support.\n\nIn essence, banning gay marriage doesn't warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's not a matter that should be taken up by the Constitution.",
            "I come from a Christian background, and as a result, I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have close gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle choices. However, I believe that homosexuality should be legalized and not a national issue decided by the president. I think it's better for each state to decide its own stance on the matter, rather than having a single national law.\n\nI understand that some states are more liberal and others more conservative, and it's natural for democratic states to support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or rejects gay marriage, it's your decision to accept or not accept that stance. I believe that individuals should have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. Therefore, I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the president should have the power to dictate how every state should govern, especially when it comes to issues like this. George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
            "When it comes to online platforms like Myspace, it's essential to remember that they are public spaces. If you post something on a public platform, you should be aware that it's accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. In this case, the school's actions were justified as they aimed to ensure student safety. Even if the students didn't post under the school's name, officials could still access their Myspace profiles from their homes. The school's primary responsibility is to protect its students, and if monitoring online activity helps prevent a school shooting or other safety issues, it's a necessary measure. \n\nSchool officials might use social media to track students who engage in behavior that's against school rules, such as underage drinking or smoking. While this could be seen as an invasion of privacy, it's a means to maintain a safer school environment. As long as their actions contribute to the well-being and safety of students, it's not an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn today's digital age, it's easy to assume that once something is posted online, it's permanent and can be accessed by anyone. This is why it's crucial to be cautious when expressing oneself online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. School officials and law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment for students, and monitoring social media is one way to achieve this goal. \n\nIn the case of the school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions were aimed at preventing potential harm, such as a school shooting like the one at Columbine. Their efforts were focused on creating a safer environment for students, which is a top priority. In this context, it's not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to protect students. \n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem invasive for school officials to monitor student social media activity, their primary goal is to ensure student safety and well-being. As long as their actions contribute to a safer environment, it's a justified measure. Students should be aware that anything posted online can have consequences, and school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for all students.",
            "Initially, I was strongly in favor of the war, especially due to the emotional impact of 9/11 on me personally. However, I now strongly disagree with the decision. I believe that our emotional response overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences, and we went into the war without a well-thought-out plan. As a result, our actions ultimately backfired. \n\nI think that as long as the groups in the region continue to fight among themselves, they will not pose a threat to us. Therefore, I don't think our presence in the area contributes to resolving their issues. Unfortunately, 9/11 has led me to become desensitized to the events in that region, and I struggle to care about what happens there.\n\nI sometimes question whether the people in the region can work together as a unified entity, as they consistently engage in internal conflicts. I believe that our approach to war differs significantly from theirs, and their methods can be brutal and focused on eliminating external threats rather than improving their own country. I think their primary goal was to have us leave, not to create a better future for themselves.\n\nI believe that our initial decision to go to war was largely driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations, I think a more thoughtful approach could have been taken. We could have developed a clearer plan for establishing order and rebuilding the region.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we went to war largely on an emotional impulse, which led to chaos and unintended consequences. It's clear that we are not equipped to change the fundamental nature of the people in that region. Despite some progress, I don't believe that our presence has been beneficial, and I think we will only continue to hinder our own interests by remaining there indefinitely.\n\nUltimately, I think it's time for us to admit that our intervention has not been effective and that the region's internal conflicts are unlikely to be resolved with our involvement. Therefore, I believe it's in our best interest to withdraw and focus on our own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several ways, the Catholic Church may need to evolve in order to maintain its influence. The Church's strict views on certain issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, may be a major reason behind its declining following. These views are rooted in traditional teachings, but they often conflict with modern perspectives and values. \n\nAs a result, some people are starting to drift away from the Church, finding its stance on these issues to be outdated and out of touch. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable following a Church that condemns these practices, and people who believe in these rights may not want to be part of a community that teaches that they are wrong.\n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and priests' marital status is another point of contention. While the Church views priests as being married to God, this concept is not necessarily relatable to the general population, where work and family life often go hand-in-hand. It's difficult to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have altered the Church's stance on certain issues, but it's possible that it could have made the Church more relatable and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church may need to adapt its stance on these issues to avoid further alienating its followers and to stay relevant in modern society. By embracing a more inclusive and accepting attitude, the Church may be able to reclaim its influence and appeal to people who feel that its current views are no longer aligned with their values.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any objections to same-sex marriage. People who identify as gay aren't making a conscious decision about their sexual orientation; it's just who they are. Therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual identity. It's unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married when a man and a woman can. Upon reflection, I believe it's morally wrong to make such distinctions.\n\nIt's clear that a person's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born gay, just as others are born straight. This inherent aspect of a person's identity shouldn't be used to justify denying them their rights. In this context, I strongly disagree with holding gay individuals accountable for their sexual orientation.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the federal government shouldn't have a say in this matter. It's not a matter of national security or moral principles, but rather a personal issue that affects individuals. The government has no right to interfere in people's personal lives and dictate their relationships.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals are who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for their natural identity. The government should respect their autonomy and not impose its authority in matters that have no bearing on national security or societal morals.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people assume that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, but this notion is misguided. Gay relationships are distinct and diverse, and they shouldn't be judged solely based on comparisons to heterosexual relationships. It's essential to recognize that gay couples face various civil rights issues, such as unequal access to healthcare and property rights, which are often tied to the concept of marriage.\n\nFor instance, gay partners are often excluded from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and making important decisions on their behalf, simply because they're not considered family. This is unreasonable, especially considering that many gay couples are in long-term, committed relationships. Studies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples, suggesting that their relationships are not inherently different.\n\nThe core issue is not about church involvement, but rather about recognizing the right to a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government. If civil unions are permitted, why not marriage? It's like comparing segregation to inequality – they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nSome people worry about the impact of gay couples on communities and the potential effects on children, but these concerns are often unfounded. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are not disproportionately affected, and they face many of the same challenges as children from heterosexual families. The main issue is not the orientation of their parents, but rather the way society treats them.\n\nIn fact, children from gay families often face bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can lead to serious problems. It's essential to recognize that parenting skills and values are not determined by a couple's sexual orientation. Ultimately, it's about treating people with respect and equality, regardless of their relationships.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in promoting gay marriage rights, and the proposed amendment banning it is misguided. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, like his views on abortion and stem cell research, may be influenced by his personal beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the entire nation.\n\nThe government should not impose its moral views on the population, especially when they contradict the values of other citizens. It's hypocritical to enforce laws based on certain religious groups' beliefs without considering the broader cultural and moral implications. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights this issue.\n\nSome people's opposition to gay marriage stems from misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as trauma or personality defects. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, and it's essential to rely on scientific research rather than popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Many people assume that because a substance is illegal, it must be entirely devoid of benefits. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While I think making a substance available to the general public is a different story, I believe it should be considered for medicinal purposes. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are proven to be beneficial. The fact that marijuana is illegal should not hinder its potential benefits. If we can accept the advantages of these controlled substances, then we should do the same for marijuana. \n\nThe comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely relevant since marijuana can be abused, but so can alcohol. A more effective approach might be to legalize marijuana gradually, removing the existing stigma around it. This could encourage people to use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. \n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems from its illicit status. However, it is not as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the image of marijuana as a harmless substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially when it comes to medical applications.",
            "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by genetics, and it's not a result of their upbringing or environment. Thus, it's unlikely that the church's rules on marriage or priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these cases.\n\nIf the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue, and they should be held accountable. However, if they were genuinely unaware, then it's not the church's policies that are to blame.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other specific comments to add beyond these observations.",
            "(laughs) \nInitially, I was somewhat accepting of the Iraq war's premise, but I think the September 11th attacks had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, and the Bush administration used that as a pretext to invade Iraq, which I believe was not the primary reason for the invasion. The administration incorrectly linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This has left a lasting impression on me, as it is a clear example of the Bush administration's willingness to deceive the American people.\n\nIt's my opinion that the Bush administration has been remarkably transparent in its dishonesty towards the American public, and has yet to accept responsibility for these actions. Not even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now admits that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. I believe this behavior is a severe breach of duty and constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, I think the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the US Constitution and attempted to marginalize it since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe younger Bush administration's intentions to go to war seem to have been premeditated, with some even suggesting that he sought revenge for his father's administration. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his book, alleged that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and was also driven by a desire to expand the US energy supply. This is a highly underhanded approach to governance.\n\nWhile I believe the Iraq war has gone on for far too long, an immediate withdrawal would likely lead to chaos and further bloodshed, given the risk of civil war. The UN and US are now exploring an alternative solution, involving a coalition of surrounding nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, I have doubts about this approach, as it may ultimately lead to issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, particularly given the ineffectiveness of the current interim government and the power struggles within the Parliament.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is dysfunctional, with the Prime Minister lacking control over the political process, and extremist elements vying for power. The presence of radical groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds significant seats in the Parliament, adds to the chaos and friction in the Iraqi political process.\n\nI struggle to articulate my concerns in polite company, but it's clear that the Iraq war has been a catastrophic failure and a grave mistake.",
            "The speaker expresses their thoughts on the War in Iraq, starting with a general sense of confusion and lack of knowledge about the conflict. They mention that the war was not officially declared by Congress and that it appears to be motivated by a desire to exact revenge against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the war's primary goal is to establish a democracy in Iraq, which they believe is unrealistic and would require a significant amount of time and resources. They also express concerns that the war is causing harm to the Iraqi people, displacing children and disrupting their education and daily lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker is conflicted about their opinions on the war. On one hand, they feel a sense of responsibility to support the soldiers fighting in Iraq, particularly those from families they know. On the other hand, they worry that the US presence in Iraq is perpetuating a cycle of violence and hatred towards the US, and that it is ultimately counterproductive.\n\nThe speaker draws a parallel with the Vietnam War, which they believe was also an undeclared war that is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They express concerns that the US is repeating the same mistakes in Iraq, with the war becoming a long and costly endeavor that is damaging the country and its people.\n\nUltimately, the speaker is unsure about what to think about the war, acknowledging that it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. They suggest that the conflict will likely continue for many years to come, with no clear end in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to make it legal or illegal. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the United States. Allowing the government to decide what's permissible or not within churches would be a direct disregard for this fundamental principle. This would be especially concerning if the government were to enforce its own preferences over those of other faiths. \n\nThe fact that some denominations, such as Catholics and Christians, have different views on this issue highlights the importance of leaving it up to individual churches to decide. The government should not impose its authority over sensitive matters of faith, which is a core aspect of the Constitution. \n\nIn fact, attempting to pass an amendment to restrict this freedom would be contradictory to the Constitution's existing provisions and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't believe that the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue, especially when there's no clear reason for an amendment other than personal beliefs.\n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment on the economy or society is unclear, but it's possible that it could even have a positive effect. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not with the government or its officials, who may be promoting their own personal views rather than the greater good.",
            "The Iraq war raises several questions about the honesty of the government in its decision-making process.  It appears that the administration may not have been entirely transparent with the American public about the true reasons for the invasion. The link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated, and the government exploited the emotional response to the attacks to justify the war. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, opposed it, especially a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Iraq war bears similarities to the Vietnam War, which the government should have learned from. Many American lives were lost, and the removal of the Iraqi government created a power vacuum that the administration was not prepared to handle. The US aimed to establish a democratic government in Iraq, just as it had attempted to do in Vietnam by removing the communist regime. However, the US government should have anticipated the difficulties and complexities involved in this process.\n\nIn hindsight, the administration was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the occupation has been prolonged. The war has resulted in significant losses among American troops, and the training of Iraqi forces to maintain order has been a long and challenging process. The US government may have misled the public into believing that the invasion would be a relatively short and successful endeavor, which is not the case.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complex issue, and the decision to involve the country in a conflict is rarely straightforward. The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",
            "To be honest, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of who they are, and it's not something they can control. Scientific research has shown that it's likely linked to biology rather than societal factors. Considering this, it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something they can't change.\n\nI think it's essential to keep politics and government out of personal matters, particularly when it comes to something as intimate as marriage. It's a private decision that should be made at a personal or household level, not at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They participate in everyday activities, such as walking their dogs, and it's clear that they deserve the same rights as everyone else.\n\nI find it ridiculous when politicians try to impose their views on what marriage means. It's a chemical and biological aspect of human existence, and research suggests that people may be predisposed to being homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention, but gay couples face scrutiny and public debate. It's essential to treat marriage as a personal, private decision, rather than a matter of public interest or government policy.",

If you share sensitive or disturbing content, like threats or violent statements, it can be taken seriously and may lead to consequences.\n\nWhen something is posted online, it can spread quickly, and people may react based on what they see. In the case of a school, if someone reports a concerning post, administrators must act on it to ensure student safety. However, it can be challenging to determine what's a genuine threat and what's just a joke.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a recent situation at our school, where a student's online post was misinterpreted as a threat. After someone overheard a conversation and reported it, the school investigated and discovered the student's Facebook profile, which contained content that was initially meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone in the context of the situation.\n\nIt's essential to remember that once you post something online, there's no guarantee of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen or taken seriously, it's best not to post it in the first place. You can't control how others interpret your content or dictate what they should take seriously.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media or monitor their online activity, if a concerning post is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. However, I believe it's best not to have a personal connection with students online, as this can create a power imbalance and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I wouldn't create a fake social media account to connect with my residents, as this would blur the lines between our roles. Instead, I prefer to maintain a professional distance to avoid having to deal with sensitive or disturbing content that may arise from such a connection.",
            "I believe the war has been prolonged excessively, and its original intention to promote democracy has been lost sight of. While the initial goal of establishing a fair government in a country without one was commendable, it seems that personal vendettas, such as George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to go to war. \n\nIt's possible that the primary objective was achieved within the first few months, and the ongoing conflict has become a means to assert our nation's power rather than a genuine attempt to bring democracy to the region. The war has dragged on for far too long, and I think it's time for our military to disengage and allow the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. \n\nThe prolonged war has put a significant strain on our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's our duty to prioritize the needs of our own citizens and allocate our resources more effectively. The continued spending on a war that has lost its purpose is not only a drain on our economy but also a reminder of the devastating consequences of war, which should not be a long-term fixture in our national budget.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point by asking a question. The situation was potentially prevented because someone searched online and discovered that there was a risk. On platforms like Myspace, people post information that is accessible to anyone, as they are often public. The only way to access someone's profile is by becoming their friend, which implies that the person has given permission to see their information. Therefore, when someone posts on the internet, they should be aware that many people will see what they share. In this case, it's possible that someone's online activity was fortunate in preventing a serious situation.\n\nHowever, this raises some concerns. If one person is tasked with monitoring everyone's online activity, it could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals. It would be unfair to assume that only certain people are at risk and need to be monitored. The situation becomes even more complex when considering whether the person who found the online activity was specifically looking for potential threats or if it was just a coincidence.\n\nPersonally, I have concerns about online safety, as I know there are people who can access my information even without my consent. I had a disturbing experience watching a TV show where someone easily obtained a person's screen name and personal details online. This highlights the risks of sharing personal information online, even with controls in place. It's hard to balance the ease of communication with the need for safety and security.\n\nI've taken steps to limit what I share online, but I also don't want to restrict my online interactions too much. The issue is complex because I only accept people I know as friends online, but I'm not sure who else might be viewing my information.\n\nWhat struck me was a story my roommate shared about her high school experience, where students were banned from using Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what their students could or couldn't do online, and I don't know if that was a matter of privacy. That's the only other thought that comes to mind on this topic.",
            "There's an issue that I'd like to discuss, the Iraq War. It's a bit hypocritical of me to bring it up now, as I was initially against it, but I feel it's not as pressing anymore. The general consensus worldwide is that the invasion was a bad idea, except within the administration, where officials refuse to acknowledge their mistake. This is evident from recent polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, which show that approximately 75-80% of the world's population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq believe the war was a bad idea and that the US should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster since before the invasion, and withdrawal will likely be challenging as well. The main problem lies in the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries, making it difficult for the US administration to understand and adapt to the region's needs. The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "There's no doubt that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. When considering the issue, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not limited to women, but is also prevalent in various fields of work. Women often face unique challenges due to the so-called \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications and qualifications, they struggle to advance in their careers because of societal expectations and historical biases. This phenomenon is particularly evident when women are overlooked for promotions in favor of their male counterparts, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.\n\nHowever, the issue isn't exclusive to women. Men can also face discrimination, especially in industries like fashion, where societal norms dictate that men should not be interested in this field. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are often stereotyped and judged by society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and difficulty in pursuing their goals.\n\nMoreover, people from different regions or backgrounds may also face discrimination, not just based on their gender but also their geographical origins or socioeconomic status. For instance, individuals with non-standard grammar or speech patterns may be underestimated by their peers, even if they possess exceptional intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of the issue, where various factors can contribute to discrimination, including but not limited to, gender, location, and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address this issue, it's crucial to promote understanding and awareness of the diverse qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped and marginalized. Education and gradual exposure to different perspectives can help break down societal barriers and create a more inclusive environment. While change may be slow, it's essential to continue working towards a more equitable society, where individuals are judged based on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, background, or geographical location.\n\nBy fostering a culture of acceptance and promoting the value of different experiences and perspectives, we can work towards a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. This requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and stereotypes. While there may not be an immediate solution, gradual progress is possible, and it's essential to continue working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
            "In my understanding, marijuana was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a traffic ticket-worthy offense. This change reduces the severity of the consequences, such as avoiding arrest, booking, and court appearances. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term implications, like those associated with a drug charge, still exist. Although decriminalization can be beneficial, it's essential to consider the costs involved in arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals, which can be substantial. For financially struggling municipalities, the decision to decriminalize marijuana may be challenging, even if it could free up resources for other essential services.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded and liberal attitude, decriminalization is more acceptable. The financial benefits of decriminalization can be significant, allowing for investments in public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Nevertheless, there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of marijuana, such as its widespread availability and the potential for impaired driving. While marijuana may not have the same debilitating effects on motor skills as alcohol, it can still have a significant impact on people's lifestyles.\n\nInterestingly, people react differently to substances, and some are more prone to overindulgence, while others can exercise moderation. It's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, as individual reactions vary greatly. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, and a balanced approach to substance use is essential.",
            "I would say yes to some extent, however, there are certain concerns. A lot of traditional practices in the Catholic Church have been maintained for a long time, which is beneficial for grounding the institution. Nonetheless, it's also crucial for the Church to be adaptable to change. Unfortunately, this adaptability is not always evident.\n\nMany Catholics are expected to attend church regularly and adhere to strict rules, which can sometimes be perceived as judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. This intolerance can be seen in the fact that the Catholic Church doesn't accept individuals from other faiths or those who don't conform to its standards. For instance, my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to the latter's faith.\n\nThis disparity between the Church's teachings and its practices is puzzling. While Catholics are encouraged to love and accept others, the Church's actions often contradict this message, as seen in its treatment of people from other religions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of traditional practices in modern times.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it would be beneficial, but I'm not convinced it would prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilic behavior is a complex issue, and individuals who engage in it are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than focusing solely on the marital status of priests.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, and it's challenging to make a judgment without potentially offending someone. The issue of separating church and state, as well as defining marriage, is particularly delicate. I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed in a specific way by the government, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some. Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider it a civil union, which is essentially a union between two individuals. This way, the government wouldn't need to delve into the specifics of the marriage, such as whether it was performed by the church or not.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among states, it would be beneficial to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage is unwarranted, as it's not a significant enough issue to alter the Constitution. The Constitution should only be amended for fundamental, widely-held concerns, not for a cause that doesn't have broad enough support.\n\nIn essence, banning gay marriage doesn't warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's not a matter that should be taken up by the Constitution.",
            "I come from a Christian background, and as a result, I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have close gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle choices. However, I believe that homosexuality should be legalized and not a national issue decided by the president. I think it's better for each state to decide its own stance on the matter, rather than having a single national law.\n\nI understand that some states are more liberal and others more conservative, and it's natural for democratic states to support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or rejects gay marriage, it's your decision to accept or not accept that stance. I believe that individuals should have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. Therefore, I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the president should have the power to dictate how every state should govern, especially when it comes to issues like this. George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
            "When it comes to online platforms like Myspace, it's essential to remember that they are public spaces. If you post something on a public platform, you should be aware that it's accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. In this case, the school's actions were justified as they aimed to ensure student safety. Even if the students didn't post under the school's name, officials could still access their Myspace profiles from their homes. The school's primary responsibility is to protect its students, and if monitoring online activity helps prevent a school shooting or other safety issues, it's a necessary measure. \n\nSchool officials might use social media to track students who engage in behavior that's against school rules, such as underage drinking or smoking. While this could be seen as an invasion of privacy, it's a means to maintain a safer school environment. As long as their actions contribute to the well-being and safety of students, it's not an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn today's digital age, it's easy to assume that once something is posted online, it's permanent and can be accessed by anyone. This is why it's crucial to be cautious when expressing oneself online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. School officials and law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment for students, and monitoring social media is one way to achieve this goal. \n\nIn the case of the school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions were aimed at preventing potential harm, such as a school shooting like the one at Columbine. Their efforts were focused on creating a safer environment for students, which is a top priority. In this context, it's not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to protect students. \n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem invasive for school officials to monitor student social media activity, their primary goal is to ensure student safety and well-being. As long as their actions contribute to a safer environment, it's a justified measure. Students should be aware that anything posted online can have consequences, and school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for all students.",
            "Initially, I was strongly in favor of the war, especially due to the emotional impact of 9/11 on me personally. However, I now strongly disagree with the decision. I believe that our emotional response overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences, and we went into the war without a well-thought-out plan. As a result, our actions ultimately backfired. \n\nI think that as long as the groups in the region continue to fight among themselves, they will not pose a threat to us. Therefore, I don't think our presence in the area contributes to resolving their issues. Unfortunately, 9/11 has led me to become desensitized to the events in that region, and I struggle to care about what happens there.\n\nI sometimes question whether the people in the region can work together as a unified entity, as they consistently engage in internal conflicts. I believe that our approach to war differs significantly from theirs, and their methods can be brutal and focused on eliminating external threats rather than improving their own country. I think their primary goal was to have us leave, not to create a better future for themselves.\n\nI believe that our initial decision to go to war was largely driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations, I think a more thoughtful approach could have been taken. We could have developed a clearer plan for establishing order and rebuilding the region.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we went to war largely on an emotional impulse, which led to chaos and unintended consequences. It's clear that we are not equipped to change the fundamental nature of the people in that region. Despite some progress, I don't believe that our presence has been beneficial, and I think we will only continue to hinder our own interests by remaining there indefinitely.\n\nUltimately, I think it's time for us to admit that our intervention has not been effective and that the region's internal conflicts are unlikely to be resolved with our involvement. Therefore, I believe it's in our best interest to withdraw and focus on our own problems."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several ways, the Catholic Church may need to evolve in order to maintain its influence. The Church's strict views on certain issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, may be a major reason behind its declining following. These views are rooted in traditional teachings, but they often conflict with modern perspectives and values. \n\nAs a result, some people are starting to drift away from the Church, finding its stance on these issues to be outdated and out of touch. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable following a Church that condemns these practices, and people who believe in these rights may not want to be part of a community that teaches that they are wrong.\n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and priests' marital status is another point of contention. While the Church views priests as being married to God, this concept is not necessarily relatable to the general population, where work and family life often go hand-in-hand. It's difficult to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have altered the Church's stance on certain issues, but it's possible that it could have made the Church more relatable and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church may need to adapt its stance on these issues to avoid further alienating its followers and to stay relevant in modern society. By embracing a more inclusive and accepting attitude, the Church may be able to reclaim its influence and appeal to people who feel that its current views are no longer aligned with their values.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any objections to same-sex marriage. People who identify as gay aren't making a conscious decision about their sexual orientation; it's just who they are. Therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual identity. It's unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married when a man and a woman can. Upon reflection, I believe it's morally wrong to make such distinctions.\n\nIt's clear that a person's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born gay, just as others are born straight. This inherent aspect of a person's identity shouldn't be used to justify denying them their rights. In this context, I strongly disagree with holding gay individuals accountable for their sexual orientation.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the federal government shouldn't have a say in this matter. It's not a matter of national security or moral principles, but rather a personal issue that affects individuals. The government has no right to interfere in people's personal lives and dictate their relationships.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals are who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for their natural identity. The government should respect their autonomy and not impose its authority in matters that have no bearing on national security or societal morals.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people assume that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, but this notion is misguided. Gay relationships are distinct and diverse, and they shouldn't be judged solely based on comparisons to heterosexual relationships. It's essential to recognize that gay couples face various civil rights issues, such as unequal access to healthcare and property rights, which are often tied to the concept of marriage.\n\nFor instance, gay partners are often excluded from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and making important decisions on their behalf, simply because they're not considered family. This is unreasonable, especially considering that many gay couples are in long-term, committed relationships. Studies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples, suggesting that their relationships are not inherently different.\n\nThe core issue is not about church involvement, but rather about recognizing the right to a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government. If civil unions are permitted, why not marriage? It's like comparing segregation to inequality – they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nSome people worry about the impact of gay couples on communities and the potential effects on children, but these concerns are often unfounded. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are not disproportionately affected, and they face many of the same challenges as children from heterosexual families. The main issue is not the orientation of their parents, but rather the way society treats them.\n\nIn fact, children from gay families often face bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can lead to serious problems. It's essential to recognize that parenting skills and values are not determined by a couple's sexual orientation. Ultimately, it's about treating people with respect and equality, regardless of their relationships.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in promoting gay marriage rights, and the proposed amendment banning it is misguided. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, like his views on abortion and stem cell research, may be influenced by his personal beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the entire nation.\n\nThe government should not impose its moral views on the population, especially when they contradict the values of other citizens. It's hypocritical to enforce laws based on certain religious groups' beliefs without considering the broader cultural and moral implications. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights this issue.\n\nSome people's opposition to gay marriage stems from misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as trauma or personality defects. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, and it's essential to rely on scientific research rather than popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Many people assume that because a substance is illegal, it must be entirely devoid of benefits. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While I think making a substance available to the general public is a different story, I believe it should be considered for medicinal purposes. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are proven to be beneficial. The fact that marijuana is illegal should not hinder its potential benefits. If we can accept the advantages of these controlled substances, then we should do the same for marijuana. \n\nThe comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely relevant since marijuana can be abused, but so can alcohol. A more effective approach might be to legalize marijuana gradually, removing the existing stigma around it. This could encourage people to use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. \n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems from its illicit status. However, it is not as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the image of marijuana as a harmless substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially when it comes to medical applications.",
            "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by genetics, and it's not a result of their upbringing or environment. Thus, it's unlikely that the church's rules on marriage or priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these cases.\n\nIf the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue, and they should be held accountable. However, if they were genuinely unaware, then it's not the church's policies that are to blame.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other specific comments to add beyond these observations.",
            "(laughs) \nInitially, I was somewhat accepting of the Iraq war's premise, but I think the September 11th attacks had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, and the Bush administration used that as a pretext to invade Iraq, which I believe was not the primary reason for the invasion. The administration incorrectly linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This has left a lasting impression on me, as it is a clear example of the Bush administration's willingness to deceive the American people.\n\nIt's my opinion that the Bush administration has been remarkably transparent in its dishonesty towards the American public, and has yet to accept responsibility for these actions. Not even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now admits that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. I believe this behavior is a severe breach of duty and constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, I think the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the US Constitution and attempted to marginalize it since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe younger Bush administration's intentions to go to war seem to have been premeditated, with some even suggesting that he sought revenge for his father's administration. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his book, alleged that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and was also driven by a desire to expand the US energy supply. This is a highly underhanded approach to governance.\n\nWhile I believe the Iraq war has gone on for far too long, an immediate withdrawal would likely lead to chaos and further bloodshed, given the risk of civil war. The UN and US are now exploring an alternative solution, involving a coalition of surrounding nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, I have doubts about this approach, as it may ultimately lead to issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, particularly given the ineffectiveness of the current interim government and the power struggles within the Parliament.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is dysfunctional, with the Prime Minister lacking control over the political process, and extremist elements vying for power. The presence of radical groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds significant seats in the Parliament, adds to the chaos and friction in the Iraqi political process.\n\nI struggle to articulate my concerns in polite company, but it's clear that the Iraq war has been a catastrophic failure and a grave mistake.",
            "The speaker expresses their thoughts on the War in Iraq, starting with a general sense of confusion and lack of knowledge about the conflict. They mention that the war was not officially declared by Congress and that it appears to be motivated by a desire to exact revenge against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the war's primary goal is to establish a democracy in Iraq, which they believe is unrealistic and would require a significant amount of time and resources. They also express concerns that the war is causing harm to the Iraqi people, displacing children and disrupting their education and daily lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker is conflicted about their opinions on the war. On one hand, they feel a sense of responsibility to support the soldiers fighting in Iraq, particularly those from families they know. On the other hand, they worry that the US presence in Iraq is perpetuating a cycle of violence and hatred towards the US, and that it is ultimately counterproductive.\n\nThe speaker draws a parallel with the Vietnam War, which they believe was also an undeclared war that is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They express concerns that the US is repeating the same mistakes in Iraq, with the war becoming a long and costly endeavor that is damaging the country and its people.\n\nUltimately, the speaker is unsure about what to think about the war, acknowledging that it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. They suggest that the conflict will likely continue for many years to come, with no clear end in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to make it legal or illegal. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the United States. Allowing the government to decide what's permissible or not within churches would be a direct disregard for this fundamental principle. This would be especially concerning if the government were to enforce its own preferences over those of other faiths. \n\nThe fact that some denominations, such as Catholics and Christians, have different views on this issue highlights the importance of leaving it up to individual churches to decide. The government should not impose its authority over sensitive matters of faith, which is a core aspect of the Constitution. \n\nIn fact, attempting to pass an amendment to restrict this freedom would be contradictory to the Constitution's existing provisions and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't believe that the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue, especially when there's no clear reason for an amendment other than personal beliefs.\n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment on the economy or society is unclear, but it's possible that it could even have a positive effect. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not with the government or its officials, who may be promoting their own personal views rather than the greater good.",
            "The Iraq war raises several questions about the honesty of the government in its decision-making process.  It appears that the administration may not have been entirely transparent with the American public about the true reasons for the invasion. The link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated, and the government exploited the emotional response to the attacks to justify the war. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, opposed it, especially a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Iraq war bears similarities to the Vietnam War, which the government should have learned from. Many American lives were lost, and the removal of the Iraqi government created a power vacuum that the administration was not prepared to handle. The US aimed to establish a democratic government in Iraq, just as it had attempted to do in Vietnam by removing the communist regime. However, the US government should have anticipated the difficulties and complexities involved in this process.\n\nIn hindsight, the administration was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the occupation has been prolonged. The war has resulted in significant losses among American troops, and the training of Iraqi forces to maintain order has been a long and challenging process. The US government may have misled the public into believing that the invasion would be a relatively short and successful endeavor, which is not the case.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complex issue, and the decision to involve the country in a conflict is rarely straightforward. The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",
            "To be honest, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of who they are, and it's not something they can control. Scientific research has shown that it's likely linked to biology rather than societal factors. Considering this, it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something they can't change.\n\nI think it's essential to keep politics and government out of personal matters, particularly when it comes to something as intimate as marriage. It's a private decision that should be made at a personal or household level, not at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They participate in everyday activities, such as walking their dogs, and it's clear that they deserve the same rights as everyone else.\n\nI find it ridiculous when politicians try to impose their views on what marriage means. It's a chemical and biological aspect of human existence, and research suggests that people may be predisposed to being homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention, but gay couples face scrutiny and public debate. It's essential to treat marriage as a personal, private decision, rather than a matter of public interest or government policy.",

If you share sensitive or disturbing content, like threats or violent statements, it can be taken seriously and may lead to consequences.\n\nWhen something is posted online, it can spread quickly, and people may react based on what they see. In the case of a school, if someone reports a concerning post, administrators must act on it to ensure student safety. However, it can be challenging to determine what's a genuine threat and what's just a joke.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a recent situation at our school, where a student's online post was misinterpreted as a threat. After someone overheard a conversation and reported it, the school investigated and discovered the student's Facebook profile, which contained content that was initially meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone in the context of the situation.\n\nIt's essential to remember that once you post something online, there's no guarantee of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen or taken seriously, it's best not to post it in the first place. You can't control how others interpret your content or dictate what they should take seriously.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media or monitor their online activity, if a concerning post is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. However, I believe it's best not to have a personal connection with students online, as this can create a power imbalance and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I wouldn't create a fake social media account to connect with my residents, as this would blur the lines between our roles. Instead, I prefer to maintain a professional distance to avoid having to deal with sensitive or disturbing content that may arise from such a connection.",
            "I believe the war has been prolonged excessively, and its original intention to promote democracy has been lost sight of. While the initial goal of establishing a fair government in a country without one was commendable, it seems that personal vendettas, such as George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to go to war. \n\nIt's possible that the primary objective was achieved within the first few months, and the ongoing conflict has become a means to assert our nation's power rather than a genuine attempt to bring democracy to the region. The war has dragged on for far too long, and I think it's time for our military to disengage and allow the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. \n\nThe prolonged war has put a significant strain on our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's our duty to prioritize the needs of our own citizens and allocate our resources more effectively. The continued spending on a war that has lost its purpose is not only a drain on our economy but also a reminder of the devastating consequences of war, which should not be a long-term fixture in our national budget.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point by asking a question. The situation was potentially prevented because someone searched online and discovered that there was a risk. On platforms like Myspace, people post information that is accessible to anyone, as they are often public. The only way to access someone's profile is by becoming their friend, which implies that the person has given permission to see their information. Therefore, when someone posts on the internet, they should be aware that many people will see what they share. In this case, it's possible that someone's online activity was fortunate in preventing a serious situation.\n\nHowever, this raises some concerns. If one person is tasked with monitoring everyone's online activity, it could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals. It would be unfair to assume that only certain people are at risk and need to be monitored. The situation becomes even more complex when considering whether the person who found the online activity was specifically looking for potential threats or if it was just a coincidence.\n\nPersonally, I have concerns about online safety, as I know there are people who can access my information even without my consent. I had a disturbing experience watching a TV show where someone easily obtained a person's screen name and personal details online. This highlights the risks of sharing personal information online, even with controls in place. It's hard to balance the ease of communication with the need for safety and security.\n\nI've taken steps to limit what I share online, but I also don't want to restrict my online interactions too much. The issue is complex because I only accept people I know as friends online, but I'm not sure who else might be viewing my information.\n\nWhat struck me was a story my roommate shared about her high school experience, where students were banned from using Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what their students could or couldn't do online, and I don't know if that was a matter of privacy. That's the only other thought that comes to mind on this topic.",
            "There's an issue that I'd like to discuss, the Iraq War. It's a bit hypocritical of me to bring it up now, as I was initially against it, but I feel it's not as pressing anymore. The general consensus worldwide is that the invasion was a bad idea, except within the administration, where officials refuse to acknowledge their mistake. This is evident from recent polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, which show that approximately 75-80% of the world's population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq believe the war was a bad idea and that the US should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster since before the invasion, and withdrawal will likely be challenging as well. The main problem lies in the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries, making it difficult for the US administration to understand and adapt to the region's needs. The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "There's no doubt that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. When considering the issue, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not limited to women, but is also prevalent in various fields of work. Women often face unique challenges due to the so-called \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications and qualifications, they struggle to advance in their careers because of societal expectations and historical biases. This phenomenon is particularly evident when women are overlooked for promotions in favor of their male counterparts, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.\n\nHowever, the issue isn't exclusive to women. Men can also face discrimination, especially in industries like fashion, where societal norms dictate that men should not be interested in this field. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are often stereotyped and judged by society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and difficulty in pursuing their goals.\n\nMoreover, people from different regions or backgrounds may also face discrimination, not just based on their gender but also their geographical origins or socioeconomic status. For instance, individuals with non-standard grammar or speech patterns may be underestimated by their peers, even if they possess exceptional intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of the issue, where various factors can contribute to discrimination, including but not limited to, gender, location, and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address this issue, it's crucial to promote understanding and awareness of the diverse qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped and marginalized. Education and gradual exposure to different perspectives can help break down societal barriers and create a more inclusive environment. While change may be slow, it's essential to continue working towards a more equitable society, where individuals are judged based on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, background, or geographical location.\n\nBy fostering a culture of acceptance and promoting the value of different experiences and perspectives, we can work towards a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. This requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and stereotypes. While there may not be an immediate solution, gradual progress is possible, and it's essential to continue working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
            "In my understanding, marijuana was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a traffic ticket-worthy offense. This change reduces the severity of the consequences, such as avoiding arrest, booking, and court appearances. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term implications, like those associated with a drug charge, still exist. Although decriminalization can be beneficial, it's essential to consider the costs involved in arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals, which can be substantial. For financially struggling municipalities, the decision to decriminalize marijuana may be challenging, even if it could free up resources for other essential services.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded and liberal attitude, decriminalization is more acceptable. The financial benefits of decriminalization can be significant, allowing for investments in public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Nevertheless, there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of marijuana, such as its widespread availability and the potential for impaired driving. While marijuana may not have the same debilitating effects on motor skills as alcohol, it can still have a significant impact on people's lifestyles.\n\nInterestingly, people react differently to substances, and some are more prone to overindulgence, while others can exercise moderation. It's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, as individual reactions vary greatly. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, and a balanced approach to substance use is essential.",
            "I would say yes to some extent, however, there are certain concerns. A lot of traditional practices in the Catholic Church have been maintained for a long time, which is beneficial for grounding the institution. Nonetheless, it's also crucial for the Church to be adaptable to change. Unfortunately, this adaptability is not always evident.\n\nMany Catholics are expected to attend church regularly and adhere to strict rules, which can sometimes be perceived as judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. This intolerance can be seen in the fact that the Catholic Church doesn't accept individuals from other faiths or those who don't conform to its standards. For instance, my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to the latter's faith.\n\nThis disparity between the Church's teachings and its practices is puzzling. While Catholics are encouraged to love and accept others, the Church's actions often contradict this message, as seen in its treatment of people from other religions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of traditional practices in modern times.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it would be beneficial, but I'm not convinced it would prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilic behavior is a complex issue, and individuals who engage in it are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than focusing solely on the marital status of priests.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, and it's challenging to make a judgment without potentially offending someone. The issue of separating church and state, as well as defining marriage, is particularly delicate. I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed in a specific way by the government, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some. Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider it a civil union, which is essentially a union between two individuals. This way, the government wouldn't need to delve into the specifics of the marriage, such as whether it was performed by the church or not.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among states, it would be beneficial to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage is unwarranted, as it's not a significant enough issue to alter the Constitution. The Constitution should only be amended for fundamental, widely-held concerns, not for a cause that doesn't have broad enough support.\n\nIn essence, banning gay marriage doesn't warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's not a matter that should be taken up by the Constitution.",
            "I come from a Christian background, and as a result, I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have close gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle choices. However, I believe that homosexuality should be legalized and not a national issue decided by the president. I think it's better for each state to decide its own stance on the matter, rather than having a single national law.\n\nI understand that some states are more liberal and others more conservative, and it's natural for democratic states to support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or rejects gay marriage, it's your decision to accept or not accept that stance. I believe that individuals should have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. Therefore, I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the president should have the power to dictate how every state should govern, especially when it comes to issues like this. George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
            "When it comes to online platforms like Myspace, it's essential to remember that they are public spaces. If you post something on a public platform, you should be aware that it's accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. In this case, the school's actions were justified as they aimed to ensure student safety. Even if the students didn't post under the school's name, officials could still access their Myspace profiles from their homes. The school's primary responsibility is to protect its students, and if monitoring online activity helps prevent a school shooting or other safety issues, it's a necessary measure. \n\nSchool officials might use social media to track students who engage in behavior that's against school rules, such as underage drinking or smoking. While this could be seen as an invasion of privacy, it's a means to maintain a safer school environment. As long as their actions contribute to the well-being and safety of students, it's not an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn today's digital age, it's easy to assume that once something is posted online, it's permanent and can be accessed by anyone. This is why it's crucial to be cautious when expressing oneself online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. School officials and law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment for students, and monitoring social media is one way to achieve this goal. \n\nIn the case of the school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions were aimed at preventing potential harm, such as a school shooting like the one at Columbine. Their efforts were focused on creating a safer environment for students, which is a top priority. In this context, it's not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to protect students. \n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem invasive for school officials to monitor student social media activity, their primary goal is to ensure student safety and well-being. As long as their actions contribute to a safer environment, it's a justified measure. Students should be aware that anything posted online can have consequences, and school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for all students.",
            "Initially, I was strongly in favor of the war, especially due to the emotional impact of 9/11 on me personally. However, I now strongly disagree with the decision. I believe that our emotional response overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences, and we went into the war without a well-thought-out plan. As a result, our actions ultimately backfired. \n\nI think that as long as the groups in the region continue to fight among themselves, they will not pose a threat to us. Therefore, I don't think our presence in the area contributes to resolving their issues. Unfortunately, 9/11 has led me to become desensitized to the events in that region, and I struggle to care about what happens there.\n\nI sometimes question whether the people in the region can work together as a unified entity, as they consistently engage in internal conflicts. I believe that our approach to war differs significantly from theirs, and their methods can be brutal and focused on eliminating external threats rather than improving their own country. I think their primary goal was to have us leave, not to create a better future for themselves.\n\nI believe that our initial decision to go to war was largely driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations, I think a more thoughtful approach could have been taken. We could have developed a clearer plan for establishing order and rebuilding the region.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we went to war largely on an emotional impulse, which led to chaos and unintended consequences. It's clear that we are not equipped to change the fundamental nature of the people in that region. Despite some progress, I don't believe that our presence has been beneficial, and I think we will only continue to hinder our own interests by remaining there indefinitely.\n\nUltimately, I think it's time for us to admit that our intervention has not been effective and that the region's internal conflicts are unlikely to be resolved with our involvement. Therefore, I believe it's in our best interest to withdraw and focus on our own problems."
