            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to adapt its views to some extent in order to prevent a decline in its following. The Church's strong stance on certain issues, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, can be perceived as outdated by many people. If the Church were to adopt a more modern and accepting approach to these matters, it might be able to retain its followers. However, some individuals are already distancing themselves from the Church due to its views on these topics.\n\nIndividuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may not feel comfortable being part of a community that rejects these practices. Similarly, those who advocate for more flexible rules within the Church, such as allowing female priests or married priests, might also feel out of place. The Church's stance on these issues has led to a rift between its traditional views and the changing values of the general public.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have made a difference. The Catholic Church's emphasis on devotion to God does not necessarily preclude the idea of priests having a family life or other personal relationships. Like others, priests have personal aspects outside of their profession, and there is no reason why they cannot balance their devotion to God with their personal lives.",
            "In my opinion, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is not something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. It's unfair to deny the right to marry to two people of the same sex simply because of their sexual orientation. I don't think the government should interfere in this matter, as it's not a legal issue or a concern for national security. Rather, it's a matter of personal identity and individual rights. People are born with their orientation, and it's not something they can change. Therefore, I don't think it's right for the government to dictate who can or cannot get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the government should respect people's choices and identities, especially when it comes to their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be stigmatized or punished for being who they are. I believe the government should stay out of this issue, as it's not within their jurisdiction to make decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nIn short, I think gay marriage should be recognized and respected, and the government should not interfere with people's choices and identities. It's not a matter of choice but rather a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be judged or punished for it.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there are no valid reasons to deny it.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is entirely untrue. In fact, same-sex relationships have distinct characteristics that set them apart from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to consider them the same. Ultimately, they are like two sides of the same coin – each with their unique aspects.\n\nWhat's more, there are numerous civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits, which are currently denied to gay couples. For instance, a partner of a gay individual may not be allowed to visit them in the hospital or make medical decisions on their behalf, simply because they are not considered family. This is not only unfair but also illogical, especially when the couple has committed to spending their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of success and share the same factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. Therefore, it's clear that a same-sex relationship is essentially the same as any other.\n\nOne of the main issues people get hung up on is the differentiation between a civil union and a marriage certificate. However, if a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. The idea that some people can have a marriage certificate while others cannot is akin to segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children raised by gay parents. However, the same concerns can be applied to any family unit, regardless of their sexual orientation. In fact, research has shown that children of gay parents are not negatively affected by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nIn reality, the main issue is not the sexual orientation of parents but how society treats their children. Unfortunately, this often results in bullying, exclusion, and other social ills. As a society, we should strive to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all families.\n\nThe federal government should take an active role in making gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment should be abolished, as it is based on personal moral beliefs rather than the well-being of all citizens. It's essential to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose its own moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMoreover, some people's objections to gay marriage are based on outdated and debunked theories about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or personality defects. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and we should rely on credible research and institutions rather than popular opinion.\n\nUltimately, by accepting and recognizing the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more just and equitable society.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It's worth noting that simply because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. Although I don't think it should be readily available to the public, I do believe it could be used for medicinal purposes. This is because the fact that a substance is outlawed doesn't necessarily mean it's without benefits.\n\nThere are many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are used in pharmacies because they have medical benefits, despite being illegal. If we dismiss the advantages of marijuana solely because of its taboo status, I don't think that's a rational approach. Instead, I believe it's essential to acknowledge its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not accurate to compare marijuana to alcohol, as abusing marijuana can lead to negative consequences, similar to alcohol abuse. However, just as responsible consumption of alcohol is possible, I think it's plausible to integrate marijuana into society gradually, rather than making it completely legal at once. This gradual approach could help prevent abuse.\n\nThe stigma surrounding marijuana stems from its prohibited status, but this image is unjustified. Compared to highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine, marijuana is relatively harmless. If we can change this negative perception, people may be more likely to use it responsibly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict in its traditional ways. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed the atmosphere and dress code have evolved. When I was younger, I'd attend a private school and see my friends at church on weekends, and it was a more formal occasion. However, the church has introduced shorter masses, such as a 30-minute teenage mass, and people are now allowed to dress more casually, especially during the summer months. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere is noticeable, even in morning masses where people used to dress up.\n\nOne of the most striking changes is the casual wear, with people wearing jeans and khakis, which is a significant departure from the formal attire of the past. Although this may not be ideal for everyone, it's a reflection of the church's effort to become more approachable and inclusive.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or the church's policies. Research suggests that pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with this inclination. While it's essential to address and prevent abuse, I don't believe the church's stance on marriage or ordination would have made a difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nHowever, if the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue altogether, and the church's actions would be unacceptable. In general, I don't think the church's rules or policies are the primary cause of pedophilia; rather, it's a deeper issue that requires a more comprehensive approach to address and prevent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone changes to become more modern and inclusive, I don't think these changes would have prevented the recent scandals involving pedophilia. Ultimately, the church's response to these incidents will be crucial in rebuilding trust with their community.",
            "I initially had some reservations about the premise, but given the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, I think the invasion of Iraq was used as a pretext. The Bush administration inaccurately linked the war with Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. This misinformation still bothers me and, in my opinion, the Iraq war remains a contentious issue.\n\nWhat disturbs me even more is the Bush administration's apparent willingness to deceive the American people and their refusal to acknowledge these fabrications. Colin Powell, for instance, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. I find this behavior to be a serious breach of trust and, in my view, constitutes a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nI believe the Bush administration has disregarded the US Constitution since September 11th and has been trying to undermine it. It seems they entered office with the intention of going to war, and their motivations may have been driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy resources.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on for too long, withdrawing troops now may lead to further chaos, potentially resulting in civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution of enlisting regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the country may not be the best option either, as it could lead to long-term issues with Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government.\n\nThe current Parliament seems ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control over the political process. Radical elements continue to vie for power, causing friction within the government. In my opinion, the situation is complex and difficult to articulate without using strong language.",
            "I'm hesitant to discuss my views on the Iraq War.  I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to share my thoughts.  It seems that the war has become somewhat pointless, especially since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think our initial involvement was likely driven by a desire for revenge following the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not well-informed about the details of the war, but I do know that we're staying in Iraq to help establish democracy and gain access to their oil resources. However, this approach is causing widespread resentment and unrest. If we stay, we'll likely face a long-term commitment to establish democracy, which might be a futile endeavor. On the other hand, if we leave, Iraqis might feel betrayed and struggle to rebuild their country without our support.\n\nTo be frank, this topic is particularly challenging for me, as I'm not well-versed in the complexities of the Iraq War. However, I have some thoughts on the matter. While I initially thought the war should continue, I've come to realize that it's more about demonstrating American power and influence rather than a genuine attempt to achieve a lasting solution. The war's legacy, much like the Vietnam War, could be seen as an unnecessary and costly endeavor.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether the war should end or continue, as I'm aware of families who have lost loved ones in the conflict and I empathize with their struggles. However, staying in Iraq might be counterproductive, as it could lead to further cultural clashes and fuel anti-American sentiment. The potential for the war to escalate and create more problems seems high.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the Iraq War will likely be a long-term issue, with no clear resolution in sight. It's a complex and multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for a state to legitimize it, as it seems to be a matter for churches to decide. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, clearly implies that this should be left to individual churches rather than the government. By attempting to enforce laws or restrictions, the government would be contradicting the constitution's principles and undermining the concept of religious tolerance in the US. Furthermore, making an amendment on this issue would be counterproductive and restrictive, as it would be one of the few instances where the government would be limiting the people's freedoms rather than the other way around.\n\nI believe that the federal government and all local governments should refrain from getting involved in this matter, as it boils down to personal beliefs and preferences rather than a pressing societal issue. The push for an amendment seems to be driven by the president's personal Catholic views, indicating a bias towards a specific religion over others. Churches should be free to decide this issue without government interference, and there is no compelling reason to justify an amendment other than personal opinions. In fact, an amendment might have unforeseen benefits for the economy and society, potentially even boosting it in some way.\n\nIn summary, I have expressed my main points and strongly believe that the government should not interfere with the decision-making process of churches on this matter.",
            "The Iraq war raises several concerns about the honesty of the US government in their reasons for invading Iraq. Many believe that the administration manipulated public opinion by linking the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This emotional manipulation played on the public's outrage following the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to the invasion in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I agree that the Iraq war is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where similar mistakes were made. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but failed to prepare for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. This lack of preparedness has led to a long and difficult occupation, with a significant number of American casualties.\n\nIn retrospect, the US government should have learned from past experiences, such as the Vietnam War, where they attempted to impose democracy by removing a government and fighting insurgents. This approach is often challenging, especially when fighting a war against the local population rather than a traditional army. The US government should have considered all possible outcomes and prepared accordingly, but it appears that they were not adequately prepared for the situation in Iraq.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in the loss of many American lives, and the Iraqi people are still struggling to establish a stable government. The idea that the US government could impose democracy in Iraq quickly and easily is unrealistic, as it took years for democracy to take hold in the US. The government's portrayal of the conflict as a short and successful endeavor was misleading, and the reality is that it is a complex and difficult process.\n\nDeciding whether to continue the war is a difficult decision, as it is hard to abandon the people who have been affected by the conflict. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a difficult decision to justify. The real reasons for invading Iraq, such as access to oil and control over resources, also raise questions about the government's motives.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq war is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it is essential to critically evaluate the government's actions and decisions. The war has resulted in significant human and financial costs, and it is crucial to learn from past mistakes and consider all possible outcomes before embarking on such a significant undertaking. Ultimately, it is hoped that the conflict will end soon, and peace will be established in Iraq, but this may not be a likely outcome.",
            "Let's start by discussing my stance on gay marriage. I've always been a supporter of it, and I believe that it's a personal preference rather than something that can be dictated by societal norms or expectations. Recent studies suggest that there could be a biological component to a person's sexual orientation, rather than it being solely a product of their upbringing or environment. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't have a say in matters of marriage, as it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families on a private level. I've seen firsthand how gay couples in my neighborhood live their lives and function as any other family would, yet they're still denied the right to get married due to societal and legal restrictions. I find it absurd that some politicians, like President Bush, are attempting to redefine the meaning of marriage to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a chemical basis for a person's sexual orientation, which is not determined by their upbringing or life experiences. For instance, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father may not be more likely to be gay. This suggests that there's a biological component to sexual orientation that cannot be changed.\n\nThe issue of marriage should be a private matter, similar to how a straight couple can get married in a small, intimate ceremony without drawing attention to themselves. However, when two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle, as seen in the media coverage of high-profile gay weddings. I believe that marriage should be a personal, private decision that's not subject to public scrutiny or government approval.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge, and you have no control over who sees it. As an RA, I've experienced this firsthand. Once something is out there, it can color people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. Even if you think you're just joking, someone might take it seriously, and it could be misinterpreted. This is why the internet is a public forum – everyone can see it, including your friends on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook.\n\nFor instance, if someone overhears a concerning comment at school and reports it, the school officials will investigate, even if they have to look through the student's social media profiles to gather more information. This is not an invasion of privacy because the information was already publicly available online. However, the school should not be actively monitoring students' private conversations or social media without a valid reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with their students on social media or try to gather information about them in that way. This can blur the lines between their roles and create an uncomfortable situation. It's better to maintain a professional boundary.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want something to be public, don't post it online. You can't control how others will interpret your words, and you can't dictate what they take seriously or not. If concerns about a student's online behavior are brought to the school's attention, they have a responsibility to act, but they should do so in a way that respects students' privacy and maintains a professional relationship.",
            "The war has been ongoing for too long and has lost sight of its original purpose, which was to restore democracy to another country. Initially, the intention was to bring democracy to a nation without a fair political system, but it seems that personal motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, might have played a role. The true justification for the war has been compromised, and it appears that we're fighting solely to prove our military strength. \n\nI believe that the initial invasion made a significant statement, but the prolonged conflict has been unnecessary. If the goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for war. However, over time, the reasoning behind the war has become distorted and misconceived, with the primary objective now seeming to be an excuse to continue fighting. \n\nIt's time to bring the war to an end and let the local government take responsibility for its own affairs. The financial burden of the war, which has already drained billions of dollars from our economy, should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. These are problems that desperately require funding, and it's unacceptable that we're spending our resources on a war that has lost its original purpose. The lives of our citizens are being lost, and it's time for us to reevaluate our priorities and allocate our funds more effectively.",
            "The speaker is seeking clarification on a situation where a potentially life-saving action was taken after someone online discovered information about an individual. They argue that if you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to many people, even if it requires being friends with the person to view their profile on a site like Myspace. The speaker acknowledges that this raises concerns about privacy, but also believes that this was a positive outcome in this case.\n\nHowever, they also raise concerns about the potential for unfair treatment if authorities were to monitor students' online profiles without a clear reason. This could lead to discrimination against certain individuals. The speaker questions the appropriateness of having someone's job be to review students' online profiles.\n\nThe speaker also shares their personal experience with online safety, mentioning a TV show that demonstrated how easily personal information can be obtained from social media profiles. They express concerns about sharing information online, but also value the ability to communicate with friends through social media. They mention the difficulty of balancing online safety with the need to share information.\n\nThe speaker also brings up an instance where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which they found puzzling. They question the school's authority to dictate what students can and cannot do online, especially in relation to freedom of expression and privacy.",
            "It's difficult for me to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially since I was initially against it. However, the general consensus globally has shifted, and it's hard to deny that the majority of people now view the war as a bad idea. In fact, according to various polls, including those in the US, Iraq, and worldwide, a significant majority of the population – approximately 75-80% – think that the invasion was a mistake. Even a considerable number of US troops stationed in Iraq believe that the war was a poor decision and that the country should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation has been chaotic from the beginning, and it's challenging to find a solution that won't lead to further complications. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem insurmountable, and attempts to impose democracy on areas where it may not be suitable have been misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, the cost of invading Iraq was too high, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking such drastic action.\n\nI struggle to see a valid reason for the US to stay in Iraq beyond the initial invasion. Despite the administration's potential plans for a gradual withdrawal or addressing potential problems associated with leaving, I haven't found a compelling argument for extending our presence. If we were to ask the Iraqi people, a significant majority would likely say that we should leave within a year or even sooner. This raises questions about our motives and the true impact of our actions. If we were to follow the Iraqi people's wishes and leave, we could at least avoid being responsible for any further chaos and maintain a somewhat positive image in the region.",
            "Gender inequality remains a significant issue in the United States, and it's not solely limited to women. The level of difficulty in achieving equality varies depending on the field of work, with women often facing a \"glass ceiling\" in male-dominated industries. Women may possess the necessary qualifications for a job but are overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations and historical biases. Similarly, men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, face scrutiny and are often judged for not conforming to traditional masculine norms. \n\nIn the fashion industry, men may encounter skepticism because their interests and styles diverge from traditional male expectations. This can lead to a lack of understanding and respect from others. However, as women take on higher positions and become more accepted in the business world, and as men assume non-traditional roles, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nTo effectively address gender inequality, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. A gradual and subtle approach is necessary, as forcing change can lead to resistance. Progress has been made, and continued efforts are underway to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nInterestingly, individuals from different regions and backgrounds may also face discrimination, with people from rural areas or with non-standard grammar facing skepticism despite their intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of social biases and the need for ongoing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance across various dimensions, including gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making it a full-fledged crime, some places have decriminalized marijuana, which means it's no longer an offense that leads to arrest and imprisonment. Instead, it's treated more like a minor traffic infraction, resulting in a citation rather than a lengthy court process. However, even with decriminalization, individuals still worry about the potential consequences, such as difficulties during job interviews or other professional settings, which can be just as severe as having a full-fledged drug charge.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of decriminalization is that arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals can be extremely costly. This can be a significant burden for municipalities struggling financially. In fact, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana due to philosophical differences, even if it would free up resources for other essential services like public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nIn areas like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization can be beneficial, as it can lead to increased revenue for local governments. This additional funding can be used to support various community programs. However, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available, as it could lead to issues like public consumption and driving under the influence.\n\nWhile marijuana may not have the same immediate impairing effects as alcohol on motor skills, it can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. The effects of substances can vary greatly from person to person, and individual personalities play a significant role in how they react to substances. Some people can handle them with moderation, while others may not. This makes it challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana. Nonetheless, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with caution and understanding.",
            "I think I'd agree, but with reservations. On one hand, the traditional practices of the Catholic Church have been consistent over a long time, and it's beneficial to have roots in history. However, it's equally essential to be open to change. Many Catholics believe in attending church regularly, but this can sometimes lead to rigidity and exclusivity. I've observed that the Catholic Church can be quite strict and unforgiving towards those who don't adhere to its doctrine precisely or belong to other faiths. This is evident in instances where individuals from other denominations or with different backgrounds, like my parents who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, face difficulties being accepted or having their unions recognized.\n\nIt seems contradictory for the Catholic Church to preach love and acceptance of others while being intolerant towards those who don't conform. The church's teachings emphasize the importance of loving others, yet its practices often contradict this message. This disconnect is partly due to outdated traditions that the church adheres to despite their incongruence with the values it espouses.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's worth considering, but I'm unsure if it would necessarily lead to a reduction in instances of predatory behavior. Pedophilia is a complex issue, and I believe it's unlikely that allowing priests to be married would eliminate the problem. Those who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIn essence, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to prevent child abuse, as the underlying issues are more profound. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than seeking superficial solutions.",
            "I'm still undecided on this topic, and it's challenging to take a stance because it involves a fine line between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. Defining marriage can be a delicate matter that may offend certain groups, so I'm hesitant to make a decision. In my opinion, civil unions are a better alternative, as they focus on the union between two individuals rather than the idea of marriage as a sacrament. If we consider marriage a civil union, the government should not discriminate based on the couple's religious affiliation or background.\n\nIf all states can reach a consensus, it would be ideal to make it a federal law. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage, as it's a relatively minor issue that doesn't warrant such a drastic change. The constitution should not be amended lightly, especially for a cause that may not be widely supported.\n\nIn essence, I don't think banning gay marriage is significant enough to alter the constitution, and it's not a matter that should be elevated to that level.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household made me somewhat ambivalent about homosexuality, partly due to my close relationships with gay friends. While I may not fully agree with the lifestyle choice, I believe it should be legalized and allowed to be decided on a state-by-state basis rather than a national level. \n\nSince the US has a mix of Democratic and Republican states, each state's laws and attitudes on gay marriage will likely reflect their dominant party's stance. Therefore, if someone chooses to reside in a Democratic state that supports gay marriage, it's logical to respect their decision rather than trying to disagree with it. My stance is that homosexuals should have equal rights to heterosexuals, and it's up to individual states to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe former President Bush overstepped his bounds by trying to impose a nationwide ban on gay marriage. As he no longer holds office, his decision wouldn't apply to all states, and future presidents could potentially reverse it. I think decisions like these should be left to individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices rather than a single national leader imposing his will.",
            "The speaker argues that a post on a public platform like Myspace can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. They believe that if something is posted on the internet, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, as it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The speaker thinks that if officials use the internet to monitor student activity and prevent potential issues, such as substance abuse or violence, it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the speaker also believes that if officials are searching for students who have broken rules or engaged in misconduct, it's an invasion of privacy. They acknowledge that it's easier to express oneself when writing, and that the internet can make it difficult to keep personal thoughts and actions private. The speaker thinks that even if they're careful, something they've written or said online could come back to haunt them in the future.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that school officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and that this includes being proactive in preventing potential threats. They use the example of lockdown drills and emergency preparedness as a way to illustrate this point. In the context of the school shooting at Columbine, the speaker believes that officials were justified in monitoring student activity online to prevent a similar incident.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that if school officials use online monitoring to make the school a safer place, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, if they're simply trying to catch students who have broken rules, it's an overstep.",
            "At first, I strongly supported the war in response to the events of 9/11, which had a significant personal impact on me. However, I soon began to question our approach and the consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional aftermath of the tragedy led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term effects of our involvement in the conflict.\n\nUpon reflection, I think we entered the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to its backfiring on us. Our decision to intervene in the region without a well-thought-out strategy was misguided, and it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation. \n\nNow, I'm firmly against the war, and I don't think it achieved its intended goals. In my opinion, the ongoing conflict between various factions in the region means that they're not capable of posing a threat to us. Our presence there doesn't seem to be making a significant difference, and I've come to feel detached from the situation.\n\nI've come to view the people in the region as being more focused on internal strife than on building their country. I believe their approach to war is fundamentally different from ours, and it's driven by a desire to expel foreign forces rather than improve their situation. In light of this, I think it's time for us to leave and not get entangled in their conflicts.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11, rather than a thoughtful consideration of the consequences. The decision to go to war in Iraq was also influenced by President Bush's response to public sentiment. While I understand the emotional context, I believe we could have approached the situation more thoughtfully and planned our actions more carefully.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think we were the right people to try to change the dynamics in the region. Their problems run deeper, and I think they will always be prone to internal conflict. Our prolonged presence in the region is not making a significant difference, and I believe we're ultimately harming ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify continuing our involvement. I think it's time for us to withdraw our forces, as the situation is unlikely to improve as long as we're there. Our continued presence will only lead to further instability in the region, and it's not a sustainable solution."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to adapt its views to some extent in order to prevent a decline in its following. The Church's strong stance on certain issues, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, can be perceived as outdated by many people. If the Church were to adopt a more modern and accepting approach to these matters, it might be able to retain its followers. However, some individuals are already distancing themselves from the Church due to its views on these topics.\n\nIndividuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may not feel comfortable being part of a community that rejects these practices. Similarly, those who advocate for more flexible rules within the Church, such as allowing female priests or married priests, might also feel out of place. The Church's stance on these issues has led to a rift between its traditional views and the changing values of the general public.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have made a difference. The Catholic Church's emphasis on devotion to God does not necessarily preclude the idea of priests having a family life or other personal relationships. Like others, priests have personal aspects outside of their profession, and there is no reason why they cannot balance their devotion to God with their personal lives.",
            "In my opinion, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is not something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. It's unfair to deny the right to marry to two people of the same sex simply because of their sexual orientation. I don't think the government should interfere in this matter, as it's not a legal issue or a concern for national security. Rather, it's a matter of personal identity and individual rights. People are born with their orientation, and it's not something they can change. Therefore, I don't think it's right for the government to dictate who can or cannot get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the government should respect people's choices and identities, especially when it comes to their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be stigmatized or punished for being who they are. I believe the government should stay out of this issue, as it's not within their jurisdiction to make decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nIn short, I think gay marriage should be recognized and respected, and the government should not interfere with people's choices and identities. It's not a matter of choice but rather a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be judged or punished for it.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there are no valid reasons to deny it.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is entirely untrue. In fact, same-sex relationships have distinct characteristics that set them apart from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to consider them the same. Ultimately, they are like two sides of the same coin – each with their unique aspects.\n\nWhat's more, there are numerous civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits, which are currently denied to gay couples. For instance, a partner of a gay individual may not be allowed to visit them in the hospital or make medical decisions on their behalf, simply because they are not considered family. This is not only unfair but also illogical, especially when the couple has committed to spending their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of success and share the same factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. Therefore, it's clear that a same-sex relationship is essentially the same as any other.\n\nOne of the main issues people get hung up on is the differentiation between a civil union and a marriage certificate. However, if a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. The idea that some people can have a marriage certificate while others cannot is akin to segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children raised by gay parents. However, the same concerns can be applied to any family unit, regardless of their sexual orientation. In fact, research has shown that children of gay parents are not negatively affected by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nIn reality, the main issue is not the sexual orientation of parents but how society treats their children. Unfortunately, this often results in bullying, exclusion, and other social ills. As a society, we should strive to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all families.\n\nThe federal government should take an active role in making gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment should be abolished, as it is based on personal moral beliefs rather than the well-being of all citizens. It's essential to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose its own moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMoreover, some people's objections to gay marriage are based on outdated and debunked theories about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or personality defects. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and we should rely on credible research and institutions rather than popular opinion.\n\nUltimately, by accepting and recognizing the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more just and equitable society.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It's worth noting that simply because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. Although I don't think it should be readily available to the public, I do believe it could be used for medicinal purposes. This is because the fact that a substance is outlawed doesn't necessarily mean it's without benefits.\n\nThere are many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are used in pharmacies because they have medical benefits, despite being illegal. If we dismiss the advantages of marijuana solely because of its taboo status, I don't think that's a rational approach. Instead, I believe it's essential to acknowledge its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not accurate to compare marijuana to alcohol, as abusing marijuana can lead to negative consequences, similar to alcohol abuse. However, just as responsible consumption of alcohol is possible, I think it's plausible to integrate marijuana into society gradually, rather than making it completely legal at once. This gradual approach could help prevent abuse.\n\nThe stigma surrounding marijuana stems from its prohibited status, but this image is unjustified. Compared to highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine, marijuana is relatively harmless. If we can change this negative perception, people may be more likely to use it responsibly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict in its traditional ways. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed the atmosphere and dress code have evolved. When I was younger, I'd attend a private school and see my friends at church on weekends, and it was a more formal occasion. However, the church has introduced shorter masses, such as a 30-minute teenage mass, and people are now allowed to dress more casually, especially during the summer months. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere is noticeable, even in morning masses where people used to dress up.\n\nOne of the most striking changes is the casual wear, with people wearing jeans and khakis, which is a significant departure from the formal attire of the past. Although this may not be ideal for everyone, it's a reflection of the church's effort to become more approachable and inclusive.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or the church's policies. Research suggests that pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with this inclination. While it's essential to address and prevent abuse, I don't believe the church's stance on marriage or ordination would have made a difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nHowever, if the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue altogether, and the church's actions would be unacceptable. In general, I don't think the church's rules or policies are the primary cause of pedophilia; rather, it's a deeper issue that requires a more comprehensive approach to address and prevent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone changes to become more modern and inclusive, I don't think these changes would have prevented the recent scandals involving pedophilia. Ultimately, the church's response to these incidents will be crucial in rebuilding trust with their community.",
            "I initially had some reservations about the premise, but given the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, I think the invasion of Iraq was used as a pretext. The Bush administration inaccurately linked the war with Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. This misinformation still bothers me and, in my opinion, the Iraq war remains a contentious issue.\n\nWhat disturbs me even more is the Bush administration's apparent willingness to deceive the American people and their refusal to acknowledge these fabrications. Colin Powell, for instance, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. I find this behavior to be a serious breach of trust and, in my view, constitutes a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nI believe the Bush administration has disregarded the US Constitution since September 11th and has been trying to undermine it. It seems they entered office with the intention of going to war, and their motivations may have been driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy resources.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on for too long, withdrawing troops now may lead to further chaos, potentially resulting in civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution of enlisting regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the country may not be the best option either, as it could lead to long-term issues with Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government.\n\nThe current Parliament seems ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control over the political process. Radical elements continue to vie for power, causing friction within the government. In my opinion, the situation is complex and difficult to articulate without using strong language.",
            "I'm hesitant to discuss my views on the Iraq War.  I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to share my thoughts.  It seems that the war has become somewhat pointless, especially since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think our initial involvement was likely driven by a desire for revenge following the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not well-informed about the details of the war, but I do know that we're staying in Iraq to help establish democracy and gain access to their oil resources. However, this approach is causing widespread resentment and unrest. If we stay, we'll likely face a long-term commitment to establish democracy, which might be a futile endeavor. On the other hand, if we leave, Iraqis might feel betrayed and struggle to rebuild their country without our support.\n\nTo be frank, this topic is particularly challenging for me, as I'm not well-versed in the complexities of the Iraq War. However, I have some thoughts on the matter. While I initially thought the war should continue, I've come to realize that it's more about demonstrating American power and influence rather than a genuine attempt to achieve a lasting solution. The war's legacy, much like the Vietnam War, could be seen as an unnecessary and costly endeavor.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether the war should end or continue, as I'm aware of families who have lost loved ones in the conflict and I empathize with their struggles. However, staying in Iraq might be counterproductive, as it could lead to further cultural clashes and fuel anti-American sentiment. The potential for the war to escalate and create more problems seems high.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the Iraq War will likely be a long-term issue, with no clear resolution in sight. It's a complex and multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for a state to legitimize it, as it seems to be a matter for churches to decide. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, clearly implies that this should be left to individual churches rather than the government. By attempting to enforce laws or restrictions, the government would be contradicting the constitution's principles and undermining the concept of religious tolerance in the US. Furthermore, making an amendment on this issue would be counterproductive and restrictive, as it would be one of the few instances where the government would be limiting the people's freedoms rather than the other way around.\n\nI believe that the federal government and all local governments should refrain from getting involved in this matter, as it boils down to personal beliefs and preferences rather than a pressing societal issue. The push for an amendment seems to be driven by the president's personal Catholic views, indicating a bias towards a specific religion over others. Churches should be free to decide this issue without government interference, and there is no compelling reason to justify an amendment other than personal opinions. In fact, an amendment might have unforeseen benefits for the economy and society, potentially even boosting it in some way.\n\nIn summary, I have expressed my main points and strongly believe that the government should not interfere with the decision-making process of churches on this matter.",
            "The Iraq war raises several concerns about the honesty of the US government in their reasons for invading Iraq. Many believe that the administration manipulated public opinion by linking the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This emotional manipulation played on the public's outrage following the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to the invasion in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I agree that the Iraq war is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where similar mistakes were made. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but failed to prepare for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. This lack of preparedness has led to a long and difficult occupation, with a significant number of American casualties.\n\nIn retrospect, the US government should have learned from past experiences, such as the Vietnam War, where they attempted to impose democracy by removing a government and fighting insurgents. This approach is often challenging, especially when fighting a war against the local population rather than a traditional army. The US government should have considered all possible outcomes and prepared accordingly, but it appears that they were not adequately prepared for the situation in Iraq.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in the loss of many American lives, and the Iraqi people are still struggling to establish a stable government. The idea that the US government could impose democracy in Iraq quickly and easily is unrealistic, as it took years for democracy to take hold in the US. The government's portrayal of the conflict as a short and successful endeavor was misleading, and the reality is that it is a complex and difficult process.\n\nDeciding whether to continue the war is a difficult decision, as it is hard to abandon the people who have been affected by the conflict. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a difficult decision to justify. The real reasons for invading Iraq, such as access to oil and control over resources, also raise questions about the government's motives.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq war is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it is essential to critically evaluate the government's actions and decisions. The war has resulted in significant human and financial costs, and it is crucial to learn from past mistakes and consider all possible outcomes before embarking on such a significant undertaking. Ultimately, it is hoped that the conflict will end soon, and peace will be established in Iraq, but this may not be a likely outcome.",
            "Let's start by discussing my stance on gay marriage. I've always been a supporter of it, and I believe that it's a personal preference rather than something that can be dictated by societal norms or expectations. Recent studies suggest that there could be a biological component to a person's sexual orientation, rather than it being solely a product of their upbringing or environment. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't have a say in matters of marriage, as it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families on a private level. I've seen firsthand how gay couples in my neighborhood live their lives and function as any other family would, yet they're still denied the right to get married due to societal and legal restrictions. I find it absurd that some politicians, like President Bush, are attempting to redefine the meaning of marriage to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a chemical basis for a person's sexual orientation, which is not determined by their upbringing or life experiences. For instance, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father may not be more likely to be gay. This suggests that there's a biological component to sexual orientation that cannot be changed.\n\nThe issue of marriage should be a private matter, similar to how a straight couple can get married in a small, intimate ceremony without drawing attention to themselves. However, when two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle, as seen in the media coverage of high-profile gay weddings. I believe that marriage should be a personal, private decision that's not subject to public scrutiny or government approval.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge, and you have no control over who sees it. As an RA, I've experienced this firsthand. Once something is out there, it can color people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. Even if you think you're just joking, someone might take it seriously, and it could be misinterpreted. This is why the internet is a public forum – everyone can see it, including your friends on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook.\n\nFor instance, if someone overhears a concerning comment at school and reports it, the school officials will investigate, even if they have to look through the student's social media profiles to gather more information. This is not an invasion of privacy because the information was already publicly available online. However, the school should not be actively monitoring students' private conversations or social media without a valid reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with their students on social media or try to gather information about them in that way. This can blur the lines between their roles and create an uncomfortable situation. It's better to maintain a professional boundary.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want something to be public, don't post it online. You can't control how others will interpret your words, and you can't dictate what they take seriously or not. If concerns about a student's online behavior are brought to the school's attention, they have a responsibility to act, but they should do so in a way that respects students' privacy and maintains a professional relationship.",
            "The war has been ongoing for too long and has lost sight of its original purpose, which was to restore democracy to another country. Initially, the intention was to bring democracy to a nation without a fair political system, but it seems that personal motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, might have played a role. The true justification for the war has been compromised, and it appears that we're fighting solely to prove our military strength. \n\nI believe that the initial invasion made a significant statement, but the prolonged conflict has been unnecessary. If the goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for war. However, over time, the reasoning behind the war has become distorted and misconceived, with the primary objective now seeming to be an excuse to continue fighting. \n\nIt's time to bring the war to an end and let the local government take responsibility for its own affairs. The financial burden of the war, which has already drained billions of dollars from our economy, should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. These are problems that desperately require funding, and it's unacceptable that we're spending our resources on a war that has lost its original purpose. The lives of our citizens are being lost, and it's time for us to reevaluate our priorities and allocate our funds more effectively.",
            "The speaker is seeking clarification on a situation where a potentially life-saving action was taken after someone online discovered information about an individual. They argue that if you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to many people, even if it requires being friends with the person to view their profile on a site like Myspace. The speaker acknowledges that this raises concerns about privacy, but also believes that this was a positive outcome in this case.\n\nHowever, they also raise concerns about the potential for unfair treatment if authorities were to monitor students' online profiles without a clear reason. This could lead to discrimination against certain individuals. The speaker questions the appropriateness of having someone's job be to review students' online profiles.\n\nThe speaker also shares their personal experience with online safety, mentioning a TV show that demonstrated how easily personal information can be obtained from social media profiles. They express concerns about sharing information online, but also value the ability to communicate with friends through social media. They mention the difficulty of balancing online safety with the need to share information.\n\nThe speaker also brings up an instance where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which they found puzzling. They question the school's authority to dictate what students can and cannot do online, especially in relation to freedom of expression and privacy.",
            "It's difficult for me to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially since I was initially against it. However, the general consensus globally has shifted, and it's hard to deny that the majority of people now view the war as a bad idea. In fact, according to various polls, including those in the US, Iraq, and worldwide, a significant majority of the population – approximately 75-80% – think that the invasion was a mistake. Even a considerable number of US troops stationed in Iraq believe that the war was a poor decision and that the country should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation has been chaotic from the beginning, and it's challenging to find a solution that won't lead to further complications. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem insurmountable, and attempts to impose democracy on areas where it may not be suitable have been misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, the cost of invading Iraq was too high, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking such drastic action.\n\nI struggle to see a valid reason for the US to stay in Iraq beyond the initial invasion. Despite the administration's potential plans for a gradual withdrawal or addressing potential problems associated with leaving, I haven't found a compelling argument for extending our presence. If we were to ask the Iraqi people, a significant majority would likely say that we should leave within a year or even sooner. This raises questions about our motives and the true impact of our actions. If we were to follow the Iraqi people's wishes and leave, we could at least avoid being responsible for any further chaos and maintain a somewhat positive image in the region.",
            "Gender inequality remains a significant issue in the United States, and it's not solely limited to women. The level of difficulty in achieving equality varies depending on the field of work, with women often facing a \"glass ceiling\" in male-dominated industries. Women may possess the necessary qualifications for a job but are overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations and historical biases. Similarly, men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, face scrutiny and are often judged for not conforming to traditional masculine norms. \n\nIn the fashion industry, men may encounter skepticism because their interests and styles diverge from traditional male expectations. This can lead to a lack of understanding and respect from others. However, as women take on higher positions and become more accepted in the business world, and as men assume non-traditional roles, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nTo effectively address gender inequality, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. A gradual and subtle approach is necessary, as forcing change can lead to resistance. Progress has been made, and continued efforts are underway to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nInterestingly, individuals from different regions and backgrounds may also face discrimination, with people from rural areas or with non-standard grammar facing skepticism despite their intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of social biases and the need for ongoing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance across various dimensions, including gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making it a full-fledged crime, some places have decriminalized marijuana, which means it's no longer an offense that leads to arrest and imprisonment. Instead, it's treated more like a minor traffic infraction, resulting in a citation rather than a lengthy court process. However, even with decriminalization, individuals still worry about the potential consequences, such as difficulties during job interviews or other professional settings, which can be just as severe as having a full-fledged drug charge.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of decriminalization is that arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals can be extremely costly. This can be a significant burden for municipalities struggling financially. In fact, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana due to philosophical differences, even if it would free up resources for other essential services like public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nIn areas like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization can be beneficial, as it can lead to increased revenue for local governments. This additional funding can be used to support various community programs. However, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available, as it could lead to issues like public consumption and driving under the influence.\n\nWhile marijuana may not have the same immediate impairing effects as alcohol on motor skills, it can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. The effects of substances can vary greatly from person to person, and individual personalities play a significant role in how they react to substances. Some people can handle them with moderation, while others may not. This makes it challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana. Nonetheless, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with caution and understanding.",
            "I think I'd agree, but with reservations. On one hand, the traditional practices of the Catholic Church have been consistent over a long time, and it's beneficial to have roots in history. However, it's equally essential to be open to change. Many Catholics believe in attending church regularly, but this can sometimes lead to rigidity and exclusivity. I've observed that the Catholic Church can be quite strict and unforgiving towards those who don't adhere to its doctrine precisely or belong to other faiths. This is evident in instances where individuals from other denominations or with different backgrounds, like my parents who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, face difficulties being accepted or having their unions recognized.\n\nIt seems contradictory for the Catholic Church to preach love and acceptance of others while being intolerant towards those who don't conform. The church's teachings emphasize the importance of loving others, yet its practices often contradict this message. This disconnect is partly due to outdated traditions that the church adheres to despite their incongruence with the values it espouses.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's worth considering, but I'm unsure if it would necessarily lead to a reduction in instances of predatory behavior. Pedophilia is a complex issue, and I believe it's unlikely that allowing priests to be married would eliminate the problem. Those who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIn essence, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to prevent child abuse, as the underlying issues are more profound. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than seeking superficial solutions.",
            "I'm still undecided on this topic, and it's challenging to take a stance because it involves a fine line between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. Defining marriage can be a delicate matter that may offend certain groups, so I'm hesitant to make a decision. In my opinion, civil unions are a better alternative, as they focus on the union between two individuals rather than the idea of marriage as a sacrament. If we consider marriage a civil union, the government should not discriminate based on the couple's religious affiliation or background.\n\nIf all states can reach a consensus, it would be ideal to make it a federal law. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage, as it's a relatively minor issue that doesn't warrant such a drastic change. The constitution should not be amended lightly, especially for a cause that may not be widely supported.\n\nIn essence, I don't think banning gay marriage is significant enough to alter the constitution, and it's not a matter that should be elevated to that level.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household made me somewhat ambivalent about homosexuality, partly due to my close relationships with gay friends. While I may not fully agree with the lifestyle choice, I believe it should be legalized and allowed to be decided on a state-by-state basis rather than a national level. \n\nSince the US has a mix of Democratic and Republican states, each state's laws and attitudes on gay marriage will likely reflect their dominant party's stance. Therefore, if someone chooses to reside in a Democratic state that supports gay marriage, it's logical to respect their decision rather than trying to disagree with it. My stance is that homosexuals should have equal rights to heterosexuals, and it's up to individual states to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe former President Bush overstepped his bounds by trying to impose a nationwide ban on gay marriage. As he no longer holds office, his decision wouldn't apply to all states, and future presidents could potentially reverse it. I think decisions like these should be left to individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices rather than a single national leader imposing his will.",
            "The speaker argues that a post on a public platform like Myspace can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. They believe that if something is posted on the internet, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, as it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The speaker thinks that if officials use the internet to monitor student activity and prevent potential issues, such as substance abuse or violence, it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the speaker also believes that if officials are searching for students who have broken rules or engaged in misconduct, it's an invasion of privacy. They acknowledge that it's easier to express oneself when writing, and that the internet can make it difficult to keep personal thoughts and actions private. The speaker thinks that even if they're careful, something they've written or said online could come back to haunt them in the future.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that school officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and that this includes being proactive in preventing potential threats. They use the example of lockdown drills and emergency preparedness as a way to illustrate this point. In the context of the school shooting at Columbine, the speaker believes that officials were justified in monitoring student activity online to prevent a similar incident.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that if school officials use online monitoring to make the school a safer place, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, if they're simply trying to catch students who have broken rules, it's an overstep.",
            "At first, I strongly supported the war in response to the events of 9/11, which had a significant personal impact on me. However, I soon began to question our approach and the consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional aftermath of the tragedy led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term effects of our involvement in the conflict.\n\nUpon reflection, I think we entered the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to its backfiring on us. Our decision to intervene in the region without a well-thought-out strategy was misguided, and it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation. \n\nNow, I'm firmly against the war, and I don't think it achieved its intended goals. In my opinion, the ongoing conflict between various factions in the region means that they're not capable of posing a threat to us. Our presence there doesn't seem to be making a significant difference, and I've come to feel detached from the situation.\n\nI've come to view the people in the region as being more focused on internal strife than on building their country. I believe their approach to war is fundamentally different from ours, and it's driven by a desire to expel foreign forces rather than improve their situation. In light of this, I think it's time for us to leave and not get entangled in their conflicts.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11, rather than a thoughtful consideration of the consequences. The decision to go to war in Iraq was also influenced by President Bush's response to public sentiment. While I understand the emotional context, I believe we could have approached the situation more thoughtfully and planned our actions more carefully.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think we were the right people to try to change the dynamics in the region. Their problems run deeper, and I think they will always be prone to internal conflict. Our prolonged presence in the region is not making a significant difference, and I believe we're ultimately harming ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify continuing our involvement. I think it's time for us to withdraw our forces, as the situation is unlikely to improve as long as we're there. Our continued presence will only lead to further instability in the region, and it's not a sustainable solution."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church may need to adapt its views to some extent in order to prevent a decline in its following. The Church's strong stance on certain issues, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, can be perceived as outdated by many people. If the Church were to adopt a more modern and accepting approach to these matters, it might be able to retain its followers. However, some individuals are already distancing themselves from the Church due to its views on these topics.\n\nIndividuals who support abortion rights or gay marriage may not feel comfortable being part of a community that rejects these practices. Similarly, those who advocate for more flexible rules within the Church, such as allowing female priests or married priests, might also feel out of place. The Church's stance on these issues has led to a rift between its traditional views and the changing values of the general public.\n\nWhile it is uncertain whether allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have made a difference. The Catholic Church's emphasis on devotion to God does not necessarily preclude the idea of priests having a family life or other personal relationships. Like others, priests have personal aspects outside of their profession, and there is no reason why they cannot balance their devotion to God with their personal lives.",
            "In my opinion, I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is not something they can consciously choose, so they shouldn't be held responsible for it. It's unfair to deny the right to marry to two people of the same sex simply because of their sexual orientation. I don't think the government should interfere in this matter, as it's not a legal issue or a concern for national security. Rather, it's a matter of personal identity and individual rights. People are born with their orientation, and it's not something they can change. Therefore, I don't think it's right for the government to dictate who can or cannot get married based on their sexual orientation.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the government should respect people's choices and identities, especially when it comes to their sexual orientation. They shouldn't be stigmatized or punished for being who they are. I believe the government should stay out of this issue, as it's not within their jurisdiction to make decisions about people's personal lives.\n\nIn short, I think gay marriage should be recognized and respected, and the government should not interfere with people's choices and identities. It's not a matter of choice but rather a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be judged or punished for it.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there are no valid reasons to deny it.  Many people claim that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is entirely untrue. In fact, same-sex relationships have distinct characteristics that set them apart from heterosexual ones, making it impossible to consider them the same. Ultimately, they are like two sides of the same coin – each with their unique aspects.\n\nWhat's more, there are numerous civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare benefits, which are currently denied to gay couples. For instance, a partner of a gay individual may not be allowed to visit them in the hospital or make medical decisions on their behalf, simply because they are not considered family. This is not only unfair but also illogical, especially when the couple has committed to spending their lives together.\n\nScientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar rates of success and share the same factors that contribute to relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. Therefore, it's clear that a same-sex relationship is essentially the same as any other.\n\nOne of the main issues people get hung up on is the differentiation between a civil union and a marriage certificate. However, if a civil union is allowed, why not a marriage? It's a matter of equality and fairness. The idea that some people can have a marriage certificate while others cannot is akin to segregation – separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption issues, community acceptance, and the impact on children raised by gay parents. However, the same concerns can be applied to any family unit, regardless of their sexual orientation. In fact, research has shown that children of gay parents are not negatively affected by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nIn reality, the main issue is not the sexual orientation of parents but how society treats their children. Unfortunately, this often results in bullying, exclusion, and other social ills. As a society, we should strive to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for all families.\n\nThe federal government should take an active role in making gay marriage legal in every state. The proposed amendment should be abolished, as it is based on personal moral beliefs rather than the well-being of all citizens. It's essential to recognize that morality is subjective and that the government should not impose its own moral standards on the entire country.\n\nMoreover, some people's objections to gay marriage are based on outdated and debunked theories about the causes of homosexuality, such as childhood trauma or personality defects. These claims are not supported by scientific evidence, and we should rely on credible research and institutions rather than popular opinion.\n\nUltimately, by accepting and recognizing the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more just and equitable society.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It's worth noting that simply because a drug is prohibited doesn't mean it's devoid of beneficial properties. Although I don't think it should be readily available to the public, I do believe it could be used for medicinal purposes. This is because the fact that a substance is outlawed doesn't necessarily mean it's without benefits.\n\nThere are many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are used in pharmacies because they have medical benefits, despite being illegal. If we dismiss the advantages of marijuana solely because of its taboo status, I don't think that's a rational approach. Instead, I believe it's essential to acknowledge its potential benefits.\n\nIt's not accurate to compare marijuana to alcohol, as abusing marijuana can lead to negative consequences, similar to alcohol abuse. However, just as responsible consumption of alcohol is possible, I think it's plausible to integrate marijuana into society gradually, rather than making it completely legal at once. This gradual approach could help prevent abuse.\n\nThe stigma surrounding marijuana stems from its prohibited status, but this image is unjustified. Compared to highly addictive substances like heroin and cocaine, marijuana is relatively harmless. If we can change this negative perception, people may be more likely to use it responsibly for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict in its traditional ways. As I grew up attending church every Sunday, I noticed the atmosphere and dress code have evolved. When I was younger, I'd attend a private school and see my friends at church on weekends, and it was a more formal occasion. However, the church has introduced shorter masses, such as a 30-minute teenage mass, and people are now allowed to dress more casually, especially during the summer months. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere is noticeable, even in morning masses where people used to dress up.\n\nOne of the most striking changes is the casual wear, with people wearing jeans and khakis, which is a significant departure from the formal attire of the past. Although this may not be ideal for everyone, it's a reflection of the church's effort to become more approachable and inclusive.\n\nRegarding the recent accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. Pedophilia is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or the church's policies. Research suggests that pedophilia is often linked to genetics, and individuals are born with this inclination. While it's essential to address and prevent abuse, I don't believe the church's stance on marriage or ordination would have made a difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nHowever, if the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue altogether, and the church's actions would be unacceptable. In general, I don't think the church's rules or policies are the primary cause of pedophilia; rather, it's a deeper issue that requires a more comprehensive approach to address and prevent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone changes to become more modern and inclusive, I don't think these changes would have prevented the recent scandals involving pedophilia. Ultimately, the church's response to these incidents will be crucial in rebuilding trust with their community.",
            "I initially had some reservations about the premise, but given the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, I think the invasion of Iraq was used as a pretext. The Bush administration inaccurately linked the war with Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which were later found to be false. This misinformation still bothers me and, in my opinion, the Iraq war remains a contentious issue.\n\nWhat disturbs me even more is the Bush administration's apparent willingness to deceive the American people and their refusal to acknowledge these fabrications. Colin Powell, for instance, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented at the UN. I find this behavior to be a serious breach of trust and, in my view, constitutes a potentially impeachable offense.\n\nI believe the Bush administration has disregarded the US Constitution since September 11th and has been trying to undermine it. It seems they entered office with the intention of going to war, and their motivations may have been driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein and a desire to expand the country's energy resources.\n\nWhile I think the war has gone on for too long, withdrawing troops now may lead to further chaos, potentially resulting in civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution of enlisting regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia to stabilize the country may not be the best option either, as it could lead to long-term issues with Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government.\n\nThe current Parliament seems ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control over the political process. Radical elements continue to vie for power, causing friction within the government. In my opinion, the situation is complex and difficult to articulate without using strong language.",
            "I'm hesitant to discuss my views on the Iraq War.  I'm not entirely sure where to start, but I'll try to share my thoughts.  It seems that the war has become somewhat pointless, especially since it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I think our initial involvement was likely driven by a desire for revenge following the 9/11 attacks, which were blamed on Iraq.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not well-informed about the details of the war, but I do know that we're staying in Iraq to help establish democracy and gain access to their oil resources. However, this approach is causing widespread resentment and unrest. If we stay, we'll likely face a long-term commitment to establish democracy, which might be a futile endeavor. On the other hand, if we leave, Iraqis might feel betrayed and struggle to rebuild their country without our support.\n\nTo be frank, this topic is particularly challenging for me, as I'm not well-versed in the complexities of the Iraq War. However, I have some thoughts on the matter. While I initially thought the war should continue, I've come to realize that it's more about demonstrating American power and influence rather than a genuine attempt to achieve a lasting solution. The war's legacy, much like the Vietnam War, could be seen as an unnecessary and costly endeavor.\n\nIt's hard for me to say whether the war should end or continue, as I'm aware of families who have lost loved ones in the conflict and I empathize with their struggles. However, staying in Iraq might be counterproductive, as it could lead to further cultural clashes and fuel anti-American sentiment. The potential for the war to escalate and create more problems seems high.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe the Iraq War will likely be a long-term issue, with no clear resolution in sight. It's a complex and multifaceted problem that requires careful consideration and a nuanced approach.",
            "I strongly disagree with making it mandatory for a state to legitimize it, as it seems to be a matter for churches to decide. The separation of church and state, as stated in the constitution, clearly implies that this should be left to individual churches rather than the government. By attempting to enforce laws or restrictions, the government would be contradicting the constitution's principles and undermining the concept of religious tolerance in the US. Furthermore, making an amendment on this issue would be counterproductive and restrictive, as it would be one of the few instances where the government would be limiting the people's freedoms rather than the other way around.\n\nI believe that the federal government and all local governments should refrain from getting involved in this matter, as it boils down to personal beliefs and preferences rather than a pressing societal issue. The push for an amendment seems to be driven by the president's personal Catholic views, indicating a bias towards a specific religion over others. Churches should be free to decide this issue without government interference, and there is no compelling reason to justify an amendment other than personal opinions. In fact, an amendment might have unforeseen benefits for the economy and society, potentially even boosting it in some way.\n\nIn summary, I have expressed my main points and strongly believe that the government should not interfere with the decision-making process of churches on this matter.",
            "The Iraq war raises several concerns about the honesty of the US government in their reasons for invading Iraq. Many believe that the administration manipulated public opinion by linking the invasion to the 9/11 attacks, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This emotional manipulation played on the public's outrage following the 2001 terrorist attacks, leading to the invasion in 2003. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes, and I agree that the Iraq war is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, where similar mistakes were made. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but failed to prepare for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. This lack of preparedness has led to a long and difficult occupation, with a significant number of American casualties.\n\nIn retrospect, the US government should have learned from past experiences, such as the Vietnam War, where they attempted to impose democracy by removing a government and fighting insurgents. This approach is often challenging, especially when fighting a war against the local population rather than a traditional army. The US government should have considered all possible outcomes and prepared accordingly, but it appears that they were not adequately prepared for the situation in Iraq.\n\nThe ongoing conflict has resulted in the loss of many American lives, and the Iraqi people are still struggling to establish a stable government. The idea that the US government could impose democracy in Iraq quickly and easily is unrealistic, as it took years for democracy to take hold in the US. The government's portrayal of the conflict as a short and successful endeavor was misleading, and the reality is that it is a complex and difficult process.\n\nDeciding whether to continue the war is a difficult decision, as it is hard to abandon the people who have been affected by the conflict. However, the astronomical number of American casualties and the uncertainty of the outcome make it a difficult decision to justify. The real reasons for invading Iraq, such as access to oil and control over resources, also raise questions about the government's motives.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq war is a complex and multifaceted issue, and it is essential to critically evaluate the government's actions and decisions. The war has resulted in significant human and financial costs, and it is crucial to learn from past mistakes and consider all possible outcomes before embarking on such a significant undertaking. Ultimately, it is hoped that the conflict will end soon, and peace will be established in Iraq, but this may not be a likely outcome.",
            "Let's start by discussing my stance on gay marriage. I've always been a supporter of it, and I believe that it's a personal preference rather than something that can be dictated by societal norms or expectations. Recent studies suggest that there could be a biological component to a person's sexual orientation, rather than it being solely a product of their upbringing or environment. I think it's inhumane to deny people rights based on something that's beyond their control.\n\nIn my opinion, the government shouldn't have a say in matters of marriage, as it's a deeply personal issue that affects individuals and their families on a private level. I've seen firsthand how gay couples in my neighborhood live their lives and function as any other family would, yet they're still denied the right to get married due to societal and legal restrictions. I find it absurd that some politicians, like President Bush, are attempting to redefine the meaning of marriage to suit their own agenda.\n\nResearch suggests that there may be a chemical basis for a person's sexual orientation, which is not determined by their upbringing or life experiences. For instance, someone who grows up with four sisters and no father may not be more likely to be gay. This suggests that there's a biological component to sexual orientation that cannot be changed.\n\nThe issue of marriage should be a private matter, similar to how a straight couple can get married in a small, intimate ceremony without drawing attention to themselves. However, when two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public spectacle, as seen in the media coverage of high-profile gay weddings. I believe that marriage should be a personal, private decision that's not subject to public scrutiny or government approval.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public knowledge, and you have no control over who sees it. As an RA, I've experienced this firsthand. Once something is out there, it can color people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or shootings. Even if you think you're just joking, someone might take it seriously, and it could be misinterpreted. This is why the internet is a public forum – everyone can see it, including your friends on social media platforms like Myspace or Facebook.\n\nFor instance, if someone overhears a concerning comment at school and reports it, the school officials will investigate, even if they have to look through the student's social media profiles to gather more information. This is not an invasion of privacy because the information was already publicly available online. However, the school should not be actively monitoring students' private conversations or social media without a valid reason.\n\nIt's also worth noting that school officials shouldn't be friends with their students on social media or try to gather information about them in that way. This can blur the lines between their roles and create an uncomfortable situation. It's better to maintain a professional boundary.\n\nUltimately, if you don't want something to be public, don't post it online. You can't control how others will interpret your words, and you can't dictate what they take seriously or not. If concerns about a student's online behavior are brought to the school's attention, they have a responsibility to act, but they should do so in a way that respects students' privacy and maintains a professional relationship.",
            "The war has been ongoing for too long and has lost sight of its original purpose, which was to restore democracy to another country. Initially, the intention was to bring democracy to a nation without a fair political system, but it seems that personal motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, might have played a role. The true justification for the war has been compromised, and it appears that we're fighting solely to prove our military strength. \n\nI believe that the initial invasion made a significant statement, but the prolonged conflict has been unnecessary. If the goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a justifiable reason for war. However, over time, the reasoning behind the war has become distorted and misconceived, with the primary objective now seeming to be an excuse to continue fighting. \n\nIt's time to bring the war to an end and let the local government take responsibility for its own affairs. The financial burden of the war, which has already drained billions of dollars from our economy, should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. These are problems that desperately require funding, and it's unacceptable that we're spending our resources on a war that has lost its original purpose. The lives of our citizens are being lost, and it's time for us to reevaluate our priorities and allocate our funds more effectively.",
            "The speaker is seeking clarification on a situation where a potentially life-saving action was taken after someone online discovered information about an individual. They argue that if you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to many people, even if it requires being friends with the person to view their profile on a site like Myspace. The speaker acknowledges that this raises concerns about privacy, but also believes that this was a positive outcome in this case.\n\nHowever, they also raise concerns about the potential for unfair treatment if authorities were to monitor students' online profiles without a clear reason. This could lead to discrimination against certain individuals. The speaker questions the appropriateness of having someone's job be to review students' online profiles.\n\nThe speaker also shares their personal experience with online safety, mentioning a TV show that demonstrated how easily personal information can be obtained from social media profiles. They express concerns about sharing information online, but also value the ability to communicate with friends through social media. They mention the difficulty of balancing online safety with the need to share information.\n\nThe speaker also brings up an instance where a school banned students from having Myspace accounts, which they found puzzling. They question the school's authority to dictate what students can and cannot do online, especially in relation to freedom of expression and privacy.",
            "It's difficult for me to discuss the Iraq War without feeling hypocritical, especially since I was initially against it. However, the general consensus globally has shifted, and it's hard to deny that the majority of people now view the war as a bad idea. In fact, according to various polls, including those in the US, Iraq, and worldwide, a significant majority of the population – approximately 75-80% – think that the invasion was a mistake. Even a considerable number of US troops stationed in Iraq believe that the war was a poor decision and that the country should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation has been chaotic from the beginning, and it's challenging to find a solution that won't lead to further complications. The cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries seem insurmountable, and attempts to impose democracy on areas where it may not be suitable have been misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, the cost of invading Iraq was too high, and it's essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking such drastic action.\n\nI struggle to see a valid reason for the US to stay in Iraq beyond the initial invasion. Despite the administration's potential plans for a gradual withdrawal or addressing potential problems associated with leaving, I haven't found a compelling argument for extending our presence. If we were to ask the Iraqi people, a significant majority would likely say that we should leave within a year or even sooner. This raises questions about our motives and the true impact of our actions. If we were to follow the Iraqi people's wishes and leave, we could at least avoid being responsible for any further chaos and maintain a somewhat positive image in the region.",
            "Gender inequality remains a significant issue in the United States, and it's not solely limited to women. The level of difficulty in achieving equality varies depending on the field of work, with women often facing a \"glass ceiling\" in male-dominated industries. Women may possess the necessary qualifications for a job but are overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations and historical biases. Similarly, men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, face scrutiny and are often judged for not conforming to traditional masculine norms. \n\nIn the fashion industry, men may encounter skepticism because their interests and styles diverge from traditional male expectations. This can lead to a lack of understanding and respect from others. However, as women take on higher positions and become more accepted in the business world, and as men assume non-traditional roles, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nTo effectively address gender inequality, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. A gradual and subtle approach is necessary, as forcing change can lead to resistance. Progress has been made, and continued efforts are underway to create a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\nInterestingly, individuals from different regions and backgrounds may also face discrimination, with people from rural areas or with non-standard grammar facing skepticism despite their intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of social biases and the need for ongoing efforts to promote understanding and acceptance across various dimensions, including gender, geography, and socioeconomic status.",
            "My understanding is that instead of making it a full-fledged crime, some places have decriminalized marijuana, which means it's no longer an offense that leads to arrest and imprisonment. Instead, it's treated more like a minor traffic infraction, resulting in a citation rather than a lengthy court process. However, even with decriminalization, individuals still worry about the potential consequences, such as difficulties during job interviews or other professional settings, which can be just as severe as having a full-fledged drug charge.\n\nOne of the main arguments in favor of decriminalization is that arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals can be extremely costly. This can be a significant burden for municipalities struggling financially. In fact, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana due to philosophical differences, even if it would free up resources for other essential services like public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless.\n\nIn areas like Denver, where there's a more open-minded attitude, decriminalization can be beneficial, as it can lead to increased revenue for local governments. This additional funding can be used to support various community programs. However, there are still concerns about making marijuana widely available, as it could lead to issues like public consumption and driving under the influence.\n\nWhile marijuana may not have the same immediate impairing effects as alcohol on motor skills, it can have a more significant impact on people's lifestyles. The effects of substances can vary greatly from person to person, and individual personalities play a significant role in how they react to substances. Some people can handle them with moderation, while others may not. This makes it challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana. Nonetheless, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with caution and understanding.",
            "I think I'd agree, but with reservations. On one hand, the traditional practices of the Catholic Church have been consistent over a long time, and it's beneficial to have roots in history. However, it's equally essential to be open to change. Many Catholics believe in attending church regularly, but this can sometimes lead to rigidity and exclusivity. I've observed that the Catholic Church can be quite strict and unforgiving towards those who don't adhere to its doctrine precisely or belong to other faiths. This is evident in instances where individuals from other denominations or with different backgrounds, like my parents who were Episcopalian and Catholic respectively, face difficulties being accepted or having their unions recognized.\n\nIt seems contradictory for the Catholic Church to preach love and acceptance of others while being intolerant towards those who don't conform. The church's teachings emphasize the importance of loving others, yet its practices often contradict this message. This disconnect is partly due to outdated traditions that the church adheres to despite their incongruence with the values it espouses.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I think it's worth considering, but I'm unsure if it would necessarily lead to a reduction in instances of predatory behavior. Pedophilia is a complex issue, and I believe it's unlikely that allowing priests to be married would eliminate the problem. Those who engage in such behavior are likely to do so regardless of their marital status.\n\nIn essence, I don't think allowing priests to marry would be a solution to prevent child abuse, as the underlying issues are more profound. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than seeking superficial solutions.",
            "I'm still undecided on this topic, and it's challenging to take a stance because it involves a fine line between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. Defining marriage can be a delicate matter that may offend certain groups, so I'm hesitant to make a decision. In my opinion, civil unions are a better alternative, as they focus on the union between two individuals rather than the idea of marriage as a sacrament. If we consider marriage a civil union, the government should not discriminate based on the couple's religious affiliation or background.\n\nIf all states can reach a consensus, it would be ideal to make it a federal law. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage, as it's a relatively minor issue that doesn't warrant such a drastic change. The constitution should not be amended lightly, especially for a cause that may not be widely supported.\n\nIn essence, I don't think banning gay marriage is significant enough to alter the constitution, and it's not a matter that should be elevated to that level.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household made me somewhat ambivalent about homosexuality, partly due to my close relationships with gay friends. While I may not fully agree with the lifestyle choice, I believe it should be legalized and allowed to be decided on a state-by-state basis rather than a national level. \n\nSince the US has a mix of Democratic and Republican states, each state's laws and attitudes on gay marriage will likely reflect their dominant party's stance. Therefore, if someone chooses to reside in a Democratic state that supports gay marriage, it's logical to respect their decision rather than trying to disagree with it. My stance is that homosexuals should have equal rights to heterosexuals, and it's up to individual states to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe former President Bush overstepped his bounds by trying to impose a nationwide ban on gay marriage. As he no longer holds office, his decision wouldn't apply to all states, and future presidents could potentially reverse it. I think decisions like these should be left to individual states, allowing them to live with the consequences of their choices rather than a single national leader imposing his will.",
            "The speaker argues that a post on a public platform like Myspace can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. They believe that if something is posted on the internet, it's reasonable for school officials to see it, as it's their responsibility to ensure the safety of students. The speaker thinks that if officials use the internet to monitor student activity and prevent potential issues, such as substance abuse or violence, it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nHowever, the speaker also believes that if officials are searching for students who have broken rules or engaged in misconduct, it's an invasion of privacy. They acknowledge that it's easier to express oneself when writing, and that the internet can make it difficult to keep personal thoughts and actions private. The speaker thinks that even if they're careful, something they've written or said online could come back to haunt them in the future.\n\nThe speaker also mentions that school officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and that this includes being proactive in preventing potential threats. They use the example of lockdown drills and emergency preparedness as a way to illustrate this point. In the context of the school shooting at Columbine, the speaker believes that officials were justified in monitoring student activity online to prevent a similar incident.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that if school officials use online monitoring to make the school a safer place, it's not an invasion of privacy. However, if they're simply trying to catch students who have broken rules, it's an overstep.",
            "At first, I strongly supported the war in response to the events of 9/11, which had a significant personal impact on me. However, I soon began to question our approach and the consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional aftermath of the tragedy led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term effects of our involvement in the conflict.\n\nUpon reflection, I think we entered the war without a clear plan, which ultimately led to its backfiring on us. Our decision to intervene in the region without a well-thought-out strategy was misguided, and it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation. \n\nNow, I'm firmly against the war, and I don't think it achieved its intended goals. In my opinion, the ongoing conflict between various factions in the region means that they're not capable of posing a threat to us. Our presence there doesn't seem to be making a significant difference, and I've come to feel detached from the situation.\n\nI've come to view the people in the region as being more focused on internal strife than on building their country. I believe their approach to war is fundamentally different from ours, and it's driven by a desire to expel foreign forces rather than improve their situation. In light of this, I think it's time for us to leave and not get entangled in their conflicts.\n\nLooking back, I think we were driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11, rather than a thoughtful consideration of the consequences. The decision to go to war in Iraq was also influenced by President Bush's response to public sentiment. While I understand the emotional context, I believe we could have approached the situation more thoughtfully and planned our actions more carefully.\n\nIn retrospect, I don't think we were the right people to try to change the dynamics in the region. Their problems run deeper, and I think they will always be prone to internal conflict. Our prolonged presence in the region is not making a significant difference, and I believe we're ultimately harming ourselves by staying there.\n\nWe've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify continuing our involvement. I think it's time for us to withdraw our forces, as the situation is unlikely to improve as long as we're there. Our continued presence will only lead to further instability in the region, and it's not a sustainable solution."
