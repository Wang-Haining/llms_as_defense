            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several ways, the Catholic Church may need to evolve in order to maintain its influence. The Church's strict views on certain issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, may be a major reason behind its declining following. These views are rooted in traditional teachings, but they often conflict with modern perspectives and values. \n\nAs a result, some people are starting to drift away from the Church, finding its stance on these issues to be outdated and out of touch. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable following a Church that condemns these practices, and people who believe in these rights may not want to be part of a community that teaches that they are wrong.\n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and priests' marital status is another point of contention. While the Church views priests as being married to God, this concept is not necessarily relatable to the general population, where work and family life often go hand-in-hand. It's difficult to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have altered the Church's stance on certain issues, but it's possible that it could have made the Church more relatable and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church may need to adapt its stance on these issues to avoid further alienating its followers and to stay relevant in modern society. By embracing a more inclusive and accepting attitude, the Church may be able to reclaim its influence and appeal to people who feel that its current views are no longer aligned with their values.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any objections to same-sex marriage. People who identify as gay aren't making a conscious decision about their sexual orientation; it's just who they are. Therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual identity. It's unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married when a man and a woman can. Upon reflection, I believe it's morally wrong to make such distinctions.\n\nIt's clear that a person's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born gay, just as others are born straight. This inherent aspect of a person's identity shouldn't be used to justify denying them their rights. In this context, I strongly disagree with holding gay individuals accountable for their sexual orientation.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the federal government shouldn't have a say in this matter. It's not a matter of national security or moral principles, but rather a personal issue that affects individuals. The government has no right to interfere in people's personal lives and dictate their relationships.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals are who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for their natural identity. The government should respect their autonomy and not impose its authority in matters that have no bearing on national security or societal morals.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people assume that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, but this notion is misguided. Gay relationships are distinct and diverse, and they shouldn't be judged solely based on comparisons to heterosexual relationships. It's essential to recognize that gay couples face various civil rights issues, such as unequal access to healthcare and property rights, which are often tied to the concept of marriage.\n\nFor instance, gay partners are often excluded from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and making important decisions on their behalf, simply because they're not considered family. This is unreasonable, especially considering that many gay couples are in long-term, committed relationships. Studies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples, suggesting that their relationships are not inherently different.\n\nThe core issue is not about church involvement, but rather about recognizing the right to a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government. If civil unions are permitted, why not marriage? It's like comparing segregation to inequality – they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nSome people worry about the impact of gay couples on communities and the potential effects on children, but these concerns are often unfounded. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are not disproportionately affected, and they face many of the same challenges as children from heterosexual families. The main issue is not the orientation of their parents, but rather the way society treats them.\n\nIn fact, children from gay families often face bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can lead to serious problems. It's essential to recognize that parenting skills and values are not determined by a couple's sexual orientation. Ultimately, it's about treating people with respect and equality, regardless of their relationships.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in promoting gay marriage rights, and the proposed amendment banning it is misguided. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, like his views on abortion and stem cell research, may be influenced by his personal beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the entire nation.\n\nThe government should not impose its moral views on the population, especially when they contradict the values of other citizens. It's hypocritical to enforce laws based on certain religious groups' beliefs without considering the broader cultural and moral implications. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights this issue.\n\nSome people's opposition to gay marriage stems from misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as trauma or personality defects. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, and it's essential to rely on scientific research rather than popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Many people assume that because a substance is illegal, it must be entirely devoid of benefits. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While I think making a substance available to the general public is a different story, I believe it should be considered for medicinal purposes. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are proven to be beneficial. The fact that marijuana is illegal should not hinder its potential benefits. If we can accept the advantages of these controlled substances, then we should do the same for marijuana. \n\nThe comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely relevant since marijuana can be abused, but so can alcohol. A more effective approach might be to legalize marijuana gradually, removing the existing stigma around it. This could encourage people to use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. \n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems from its illicit status. However, it is not as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the image of marijuana as a harmless substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially when it comes to medical applications.",
            "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by genetics, and it's not a result of their upbringing or environment. Thus, it's unlikely that the church's rules on marriage or priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these cases.\n\nIf the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue, and they should be held accountable. However, if they were genuinely unaware, then it's not the church's policies that are to blame.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other specific comments to add beyond these observations.",
            "(laughs) \nInitially, I was somewhat accepting of the Iraq war's premise, but I think the September 11th attacks had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, and the Bush administration used that as a pretext to invade Iraq, which I believe was not the primary reason for the invasion. The administration incorrectly linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This has left a lasting impression on me, as it is a clear example of the Bush administration's willingness to deceive the American people.\n\nIt's my opinion that the Bush administration has been remarkably transparent in its dishonesty towards the American public, and has yet to accept responsibility for these actions. Not even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now admits that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. I believe this behavior is a severe breach of duty and constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, I think the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the US Constitution and attempted to marginalize it since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe younger Bush administration's intentions to go to war seem to have been premeditated, with some even suggesting that he sought revenge for his father's administration. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his book, alleged that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and was also driven by a desire to expand the US energy supply. This is a highly underhanded approach to governance.\n\nWhile I believe the Iraq war has gone on for far too long, an immediate withdrawal would likely lead to chaos and further bloodshed, given the risk of civil war. The UN and US are now exploring an alternative solution, involving a coalition of surrounding nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, I have doubts about this approach, as it may ultimately lead to issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, particularly given the ineffectiveness of the current interim government and the power struggles within the Parliament.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is dysfunctional, with the Prime Minister lacking control over the political process, and extremist elements vying for power. The presence of radical groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds significant seats in the Parliament, adds to the chaos and friction in the Iraqi political process.\n\nI struggle to articulate my concerns in polite company, but it's clear that the Iraq war has been a catastrophic failure and a grave mistake.",
            "The speaker expresses their thoughts on the War in Iraq, starting with a general sense of confusion and lack of knowledge about the conflict. They mention that the war was not officially declared by Congress and that it appears to be motivated by a desire to exact revenge against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the war's primary goal is to establish a democracy in Iraq, which they believe is unrealistic and would require a significant amount of time and resources. They also express concerns that the war is causing harm to the Iraqi people, displacing children and disrupting their education and daily lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker is conflicted about their opinions on the war. On one hand, they feel a sense of responsibility to support the soldiers fighting in Iraq, particularly those from families they know. On the other hand, they worry that the US presence in Iraq is perpetuating a cycle of violence and hatred towards the US, and that it is ultimately counterproductive.\n\nThe speaker draws a parallel with the Vietnam War, which they believe was also an undeclared war that is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They express concerns that the US is repeating the same mistakes in Iraq, with the war becoming a long and costly endeavor that is damaging the country and its people.\n\nUltimately, the speaker is unsure about what to think about the war, acknowledging that it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. They suggest that the conflict will likely continue for many years to come, with no clear end in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to make it legal or illegal. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the United States. Allowing the government to decide what's permissible or not within churches would be a direct disregard for this fundamental principle. This would be especially concerning if the government were to enforce its own preferences over those of other faiths. \n\nThe fact that some denominations, such as Catholics and Christians, have different views on this issue highlights the importance of leaving it up to individual churches to decide. The government should not impose its authority over sensitive matters of faith, which is a core aspect of the Constitution. \n\nIn fact, attempting to pass an amendment to restrict this freedom would be contradictory to the Constitution's existing provisions and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't believe that the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue, especially when there's no clear reason for an amendment other than personal beliefs.\n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment on the economy or society is unclear, but it's possible that it could even have a positive effect. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not with the government or its officials, who may be promoting their own personal views rather than the greater good.",
            "The Iraq war raises several questions about the honesty of the government in its decision-making process.  It appears that the administration may not have been entirely transparent with the American public about the true reasons for the invasion. The link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated, and the government exploited the emotional response to the attacks to justify the war. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, opposed it, especially a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Iraq war bears similarities to the Vietnam War, which the government should have learned from. Many American lives were lost, and the removal of the Iraqi government created a power vacuum that the administration was not prepared to handle. The US aimed to establish a democratic government in Iraq, just as it had attempted to do in Vietnam by removing the communist regime. However, the US government should have anticipated the difficulties and complexities involved in this process.\n\nIn hindsight, the administration was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the occupation has been prolonged. The war has resulted in significant losses among American troops, and the training of Iraqi forces to maintain order has been a long and challenging process. The US government may have misled the public into believing that the invasion would be a relatively short and successful endeavor, which is not the case.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complex issue, and the decision to involve the country in a conflict is rarely straightforward. The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",
            "To be honest, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of who they are, and it's not something they can control. Scientific research has shown that it's likely linked to biology rather than societal factors. Considering this, it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something they can't change.\n\nI think it's essential to keep politics and government out of personal matters, particularly when it comes to something as intimate as marriage. It's a private decision that should be made at a personal or household level, not at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They participate in everyday activities, such as walking their dogs, and it's clear that they deserve the same rights as everyone else.\n\nI find it ridiculous when politicians try to impose their views on what marriage means. It's a chemical and biological aspect of human existence, and research suggests that people may be predisposed to being homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention, but gay couples face scrutiny and public debate. It's essential to treat marriage as a personal, private decision, rather than a matter of public interest or government policy.",

If you share sensitive or disturbing content, like threats or violent statements, it can be taken seriously and may lead to consequences.\n\nWhen something is posted online, it can spread quickly, and people may react based on what they see. In the case of a school, if someone reports a concerning post, administrators must act on it to ensure student safety. However, it can be challenging to determine what's a genuine threat and what's just a joke.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a recent situation at our school, where a student's online post was misinterpreted as a threat. After someone overheard a conversation and reported it, the school investigated and discovered the student's Facebook profile, which contained content that was initially meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone in the context of the situation.\n\nIt's essential to remember that once you post something online, there's no guarantee of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen or taken seriously, it's best not to post it in the first place. You can't control how others interpret your content or dictate what they should take seriously.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media or monitor their online activity, if a concerning post is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. However, I believe it's best not to have a personal connection with students online, as this can create a power imbalance and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I wouldn't create a fake social media account to connect with my residents, as this would blur the lines between our roles. Instead, I prefer to maintain a professional distance to avoid having to deal with sensitive or disturbing content that may arise from such a connection.",
            "I believe the war has been prolonged excessively, and its original intention to promote democracy has been lost sight of. While the initial goal of establishing a fair government in a country without one was commendable, it seems that personal vendettas, such as George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to go to war. \n\nIt's possible that the primary objective was achieved within the first few months, and the ongoing conflict has become a means to assert our nation's power rather than a genuine attempt to bring democracy to the region. The war has dragged on for far too long, and I think it's time for our military to disengage and allow the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. \n\nThe prolonged war has put a significant strain on our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's our duty to prioritize the needs of our own citizens and allocate our resources more effectively. The continued spending on a war that has lost its purpose is not only a drain on our economy but also a reminder of the devastating consequences of war, which should not be a long-term fixture in our national budget.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point by asking a question. The situation was potentially prevented because someone searched online and discovered that there was a risk. On platforms like Myspace, people post information that is accessible to anyone, as they are often public. The only way to access someone's profile is by becoming their friend, which implies that the person has given permission to see their information. Therefore, when someone posts on the internet, they should be aware that many people will see what they share. In this case, it's possible that someone's online activity was fortunate in preventing a serious situation.\n\nHowever, this raises some concerns. If one person is tasked with monitoring everyone's online activity, it could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals. It would be unfair to assume that only certain people are at risk and need to be monitored. The situation becomes even more complex when considering whether the person who found the online activity was specifically looking for potential threats or if it was just a coincidence.\n\nPersonally, I have concerns about online safety, as I know there are people who can access my information even without my consent. I had a disturbing experience watching a TV show where someone easily obtained a person's screen name and personal details online. This highlights the risks of sharing personal information online, even with controls in place. It's hard to balance the ease of communication with the need for safety and security.\n\nI've taken steps to limit what I share online, but I also don't want to restrict my online interactions too much. The issue is complex because I only accept people I know as friends online, but I'm not sure who else might be viewing my information.\n\nWhat struck me was a story my roommate shared about her high school experience, where students were banned from using Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what their students could or couldn't do online, and I don't know if that was a matter of privacy. That's the only other thought that comes to mind on this topic.",
            "There's an issue that I'd like to discuss, the Iraq War. It's a bit hypocritical of me to bring it up now, as I was initially against it, but I feel it's not as pressing anymore. The general consensus worldwide is that the invasion was a bad idea, except within the administration, where officials refuse to acknowledge their mistake. This is evident from recent polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, which show that approximately 75-80% of the world's population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq believe the war was a bad idea and that the US should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster since before the invasion, and withdrawal will likely be challenging as well. The main problem lies in the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries, making it difficult for the US administration to understand and adapt to the region's needs. The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "There's no doubt that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. When considering the issue, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not limited to women, but is also prevalent in various fields of work. Women often face unique challenges due to the so-called \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications and qualifications, they struggle to advance in their careers because of societal expectations and historical biases. This phenomenon is particularly evident when women are overlooked for promotions in favor of their male counterparts, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.\n\nHowever, the issue isn't exclusive to women. Men can also face discrimination, especially in industries like fashion, where societal norms dictate that men should not be interested in this field. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are often stereotyped and judged by society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and difficulty in pursuing their goals.\n\nMoreover, people from different regions or backgrounds may also face discrimination, not just based on their gender but also their geographical origins or socioeconomic status. For instance, individuals with non-standard grammar or speech patterns may be underestimated by their peers, even if they possess exceptional intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of the issue, where various factors can contribute to discrimination, including but not limited to, gender, location, and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address this issue, it's crucial to promote understanding and awareness of the diverse qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped and marginalized. Education and gradual exposure to different perspectives can help break down societal barriers and create a more inclusive environment. While change may be slow, it's essential to continue working towards a more equitable society, where individuals are judged based on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, background, or geographical location.\n\nBy fostering a culture of acceptance and promoting the value of different experiences and perspectives, we can work towards a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. This requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and stereotypes. While there may not be an immediate solution, gradual progress is possible, and it's essential to continue working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
            "In my understanding, marijuana was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a traffic ticket-worthy offense. This change reduces the severity of the consequences, such as avoiding arrest, booking, and court appearances. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term implications, like those associated with a drug charge, still exist. Although decriminalization can be beneficial, it's essential to consider the costs involved in arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals, which can be substantial. For financially struggling municipalities, the decision to decriminalize marijuana may be challenging, even if it could free up resources for other essential services.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded and liberal attitude, decriminalization is more acceptable. The financial benefits of decriminalization can be significant, allowing for investments in public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Nevertheless, there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of marijuana, such as its widespread availability and the potential for impaired driving. While marijuana may not have the same debilitating effects on motor skills as alcohol, it can still have a significant impact on people's lifestyles.\n\nInterestingly, people react differently to substances, and some are more prone to overindulgence, while others can exercise moderation. It's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, as individual reactions vary greatly. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, and a balanced approach to substance use is essential.",
            "I would say yes to some extent, however, there are certain concerns. A lot of traditional practices in the Catholic Church have been maintained for a long time, which is beneficial for grounding the institution. Nonetheless, it's also crucial for the Church to be adaptable to change. Unfortunately, this adaptability is not always evident.\n\nMany Catholics are expected to attend church regularly and adhere to strict rules, which can sometimes be perceived as judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. This intolerance can be seen in the fact that the Catholic Church doesn't accept individuals from other faiths or those who don't conform to its standards. For instance, my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to the latter's faith.\n\nThis disparity between the Church's teachings and its practices is puzzling. While Catholics are encouraged to love and accept others, the Church's actions often contradict this message, as seen in its treatment of people from other religions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of traditional practices in modern times.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it would be beneficial, but I'm not convinced it would prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilic behavior is a complex issue, and individuals who engage in it are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than focusing solely on the marital status of priests.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, and it's challenging to make a judgment without potentially offending someone. The issue of separating church and state, as well as defining marriage, is particularly delicate. I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed in a specific way by the government, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some. Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider it a civil union, which is essentially a union between two individuals. This way, the government wouldn't need to delve into the specifics of the marriage, such as whether it was performed by the church or not.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among states, it would be beneficial to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage is unwarranted, as it's not a significant enough issue to alter the Constitution. The Constitution should only be amended for fundamental, widely-held concerns, not for a cause that doesn't have broad enough support.\n\nIn essence, banning gay marriage doesn't warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's not a matter that should be taken up by the Constitution.",
            "I come from a Christian background, and as a result, I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have close gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle choices. However, I believe that homosexuality should be legalized and not a national issue decided by the president. I think it's better for each state to decide its own stance on the matter, rather than having a single national law.\n\nI understand that some states are more liberal and others more conservative, and it's natural for democratic states to support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or rejects gay marriage, it's your decision to accept or not accept that stance. I believe that individuals should have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. Therefore, I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the president should have the power to dictate how every state should govern, especially when it comes to issues like this. George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
            "When it comes to online platforms like Myspace, it's essential to remember that they are public spaces. If you post something on a public platform, you should be aware that it's accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. In this case, the school's actions were justified as they aimed to ensure student safety. Even if the students didn't post under the school's name, officials could still access their Myspace profiles from their homes. The school's primary responsibility is to protect its students, and if monitoring online activity helps prevent a school shooting or other safety issues, it's a necessary measure. \n\nSchool officials might use social media to track students who engage in behavior that's against school rules, such as underage drinking or smoking. While this could be seen as an invasion of privacy, it's a means to maintain a safer school environment. As long as their actions contribute to the well-being and safety of students, it's not an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn today's digital age, it's easy to assume that once something is posted online, it's permanent and can be accessed by anyone. This is why it's crucial to be cautious when expressing oneself online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. School officials and law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment for students, and monitoring social media is one way to achieve this goal. \n\nIn the case of the school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions were aimed at preventing potential harm, such as a school shooting like the one at Columbine. Their efforts were focused on creating a safer environment for students, which is a top priority. In this context, it's not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to protect students. \n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem invasive for school officials to monitor student social media activity, their primary goal is to ensure student safety and well-being. As long as their actions contribute to a safer environment, it's a justified measure. Students should be aware that anything posted online can have consequences, and school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for all students.",
            "Initially, I was strongly in favor of the war, especially due to the emotional impact of 9/11 on me personally. However, I now strongly disagree with the decision. I believe that our emotional response overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences, and we went into the war without a well-thought-out plan. As a result, our actions ultimately backfired. \n\nI think that as long as the groups in the region continue to fight among themselves, they will not pose a threat to us. Therefore, I don't think our presence in the area contributes to resolving their issues. Unfortunately, 9/11 has led me to become desensitized to the events in that region, and I struggle to care about what happens there.\n\nI sometimes question whether the people in the region can work together as a unified entity, as they consistently engage in internal conflicts. I believe that our approach to war differs significantly from theirs, and their methods can be brutal and focused on eliminating external threats rather than improving their own country. I think their primary goal was to have us leave, not to create a better future for themselves.\n\nI believe that our initial decision to go to war was largely driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations, I think a more thoughtful approach could have been taken. We could have developed a clearer plan for establishing order and rebuilding the region.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we went to war largely on an emotional impulse, which led to chaos and unintended consequences. It's clear that we are not equipped to change the fundamental nature of the people in that region. Despite some progress, I don't believe that our presence has been beneficial, and I think we will only continue to hinder our own interests by remaining there indefinitely.\n\nUltimately, I think it's time for us to admit that our intervention has not been effective and that the region's internal conflicts are unlikely to be resolved with our involvement. Therefore, I believe it's in our best interest to withdraw and focus on our own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several ways, the Catholic Church may need to evolve in order to maintain its influence. The Church's strict views on certain issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, may be a major reason behind its declining following. These views are rooted in traditional teachings, but they often conflict with modern perspectives and values. \n\nAs a result, some people are starting to drift away from the Church, finding its stance on these issues to be outdated and out of touch. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable following a Church that condemns these practices, and people who believe in these rights may not want to be part of a community that teaches that they are wrong.\n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and priests' marital status is another point of contention. While the Church views priests as being married to God, this concept is not necessarily relatable to the general population, where work and family life often go hand-in-hand. It's difficult to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have altered the Church's stance on certain issues, but it's possible that it could have made the Church more relatable and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church may need to adapt its stance on these issues to avoid further alienating its followers and to stay relevant in modern society. By embracing a more inclusive and accepting attitude, the Church may be able to reclaim its influence and appeal to people who feel that its current views are no longer aligned with their values.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any objections to same-sex marriage. People who identify as gay aren't making a conscious decision about their sexual orientation; it's just who they are. Therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual identity. It's unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married when a man and a woman can. Upon reflection, I believe it's morally wrong to make such distinctions.\n\nIt's clear that a person's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born gay, just as others are born straight. This inherent aspect of a person's identity shouldn't be used to justify denying them their rights. In this context, I strongly disagree with holding gay individuals accountable for their sexual orientation.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the federal government shouldn't have a say in this matter. It's not a matter of national security or moral principles, but rather a personal issue that affects individuals. The government has no right to interfere in people's personal lives and dictate their relationships.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals are who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for their natural identity. The government should respect their autonomy and not impose its authority in matters that have no bearing on national security or societal morals.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people assume that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, but this notion is misguided. Gay relationships are distinct and diverse, and they shouldn't be judged solely based on comparisons to heterosexual relationships. It's essential to recognize that gay couples face various civil rights issues, such as unequal access to healthcare and property rights, which are often tied to the concept of marriage.\n\nFor instance, gay partners are often excluded from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and making important decisions on their behalf, simply because they're not considered family. This is unreasonable, especially considering that many gay couples are in long-term, committed relationships. Studies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples, suggesting that their relationships are not inherently different.\n\nThe core issue is not about church involvement, but rather about recognizing the right to a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government. If civil unions are permitted, why not marriage? It's like comparing segregation to inequality – they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nSome people worry about the impact of gay couples on communities and the potential effects on children, but these concerns are often unfounded. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are not disproportionately affected, and they face many of the same challenges as children from heterosexual families. The main issue is not the orientation of their parents, but rather the way society treats them.\n\nIn fact, children from gay families often face bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can lead to serious problems. It's essential to recognize that parenting skills and values are not determined by a couple's sexual orientation. Ultimately, it's about treating people with respect and equality, regardless of their relationships.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in promoting gay marriage rights, and the proposed amendment banning it is misguided. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, like his views on abortion and stem cell research, may be influenced by his personal beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the entire nation.\n\nThe government should not impose its moral views on the population, especially when they contradict the values of other citizens. It's hypocritical to enforce laws based on certain religious groups' beliefs without considering the broader cultural and moral implications. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights this issue.\n\nSome people's opposition to gay marriage stems from misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as trauma or personality defects. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, and it's essential to rely on scientific research rather than popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Many people assume that because a substance is illegal, it must be entirely devoid of benefits. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While I think making a substance available to the general public is a different story, I believe it should be considered for medicinal purposes. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are proven to be beneficial. The fact that marijuana is illegal should not hinder its potential benefits. If we can accept the advantages of these controlled substances, then we should do the same for marijuana. \n\nThe comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely relevant since marijuana can be abused, but so can alcohol. A more effective approach might be to legalize marijuana gradually, removing the existing stigma around it. This could encourage people to use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. \n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems from its illicit status. However, it is not as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the image of marijuana as a harmless substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially when it comes to medical applications.",
            "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by genetics, and it's not a result of their upbringing or environment. Thus, it's unlikely that the church's rules on marriage or priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these cases.\n\nIf the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue, and they should be held accountable. However, if they were genuinely unaware, then it's not the church's policies that are to blame.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other specific comments to add beyond these observations.",
            "(laughs) \nInitially, I was somewhat accepting of the Iraq war's premise, but I think the September 11th attacks had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, and the Bush administration used that as a pretext to invade Iraq, which I believe was not the primary reason for the invasion. The administration incorrectly linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This has left a lasting impression on me, as it is a clear example of the Bush administration's willingness to deceive the American people.\n\nIt's my opinion that the Bush administration has been remarkably transparent in its dishonesty towards the American public, and has yet to accept responsibility for these actions. Not even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now admits that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. I believe this behavior is a severe breach of duty and constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, I think the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the US Constitution and attempted to marginalize it since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe younger Bush administration's intentions to go to war seem to have been premeditated, with some even suggesting that he sought revenge for his father's administration. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his book, alleged that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and was also driven by a desire to expand the US energy supply. This is a highly underhanded approach to governance.\n\nWhile I believe the Iraq war has gone on for far too long, an immediate withdrawal would likely lead to chaos and further bloodshed, given the risk of civil war. The UN and US are now exploring an alternative solution, involving a coalition of surrounding nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, I have doubts about this approach, as it may ultimately lead to issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, particularly given the ineffectiveness of the current interim government and the power struggles within the Parliament.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is dysfunctional, with the Prime Minister lacking control over the political process, and extremist elements vying for power. The presence of radical groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds significant seats in the Parliament, adds to the chaos and friction in the Iraqi political process.\n\nI struggle to articulate my concerns in polite company, but it's clear that the Iraq war has been a catastrophic failure and a grave mistake.",
            "The speaker expresses their thoughts on the War in Iraq, starting with a general sense of confusion and lack of knowledge about the conflict. They mention that the war was not officially declared by Congress and that it appears to be motivated by a desire to exact revenge against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the war's primary goal is to establish a democracy in Iraq, which they believe is unrealistic and would require a significant amount of time and resources. They also express concerns that the war is causing harm to the Iraqi people, displacing children and disrupting their education and daily lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker is conflicted about their opinions on the war. On one hand, they feel a sense of responsibility to support the soldiers fighting in Iraq, particularly those from families they know. On the other hand, they worry that the US presence in Iraq is perpetuating a cycle of violence and hatred towards the US, and that it is ultimately counterproductive.\n\nThe speaker draws a parallel with the Vietnam War, which they believe was also an undeclared war that is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They express concerns that the US is repeating the same mistakes in Iraq, with the war becoming a long and costly endeavor that is damaging the country and its people.\n\nUltimately, the speaker is unsure about what to think about the war, acknowledging that it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. They suggest that the conflict will likely continue for many years to come, with no clear end in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to make it legal or illegal. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the United States. Allowing the government to decide what's permissible or not within churches would be a direct disregard for this fundamental principle. This would be especially concerning if the government were to enforce its own preferences over those of other faiths. \n\nThe fact that some denominations, such as Catholics and Christians, have different views on this issue highlights the importance of leaving it up to individual churches to decide. The government should not impose its authority over sensitive matters of faith, which is a core aspect of the Constitution. \n\nIn fact, attempting to pass an amendment to restrict this freedom would be contradictory to the Constitution's existing provisions and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't believe that the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue, especially when there's no clear reason for an amendment other than personal beliefs.\n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment on the economy or society is unclear, but it's possible that it could even have a positive effect. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not with the government or its officials, who may be promoting their own personal views rather than the greater good.",
            "The Iraq war raises several questions about the honesty of the government in its decision-making process.  It appears that the administration may not have been entirely transparent with the American public about the true reasons for the invasion. The link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated, and the government exploited the emotional response to the attacks to justify the war. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, opposed it, especially a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Iraq war bears similarities to the Vietnam War, which the government should have learned from. Many American lives were lost, and the removal of the Iraqi government created a power vacuum that the administration was not prepared to handle. The US aimed to establish a democratic government in Iraq, just as it had attempted to do in Vietnam by removing the communist regime. However, the US government should have anticipated the difficulties and complexities involved in this process.\n\nIn hindsight, the administration was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the occupation has been prolonged. The war has resulted in significant losses among American troops, and the training of Iraqi forces to maintain order has been a long and challenging process. The US government may have misled the public into believing that the invasion would be a relatively short and successful endeavor, which is not the case.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complex issue, and the decision to involve the country in a conflict is rarely straightforward. The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",
            "To be honest, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of who they are, and it's not something they can control. Scientific research has shown that it's likely linked to biology rather than societal factors. Considering this, it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something they can't change.\n\nI think it's essential to keep politics and government out of personal matters, particularly when it comes to something as intimate as marriage. It's a private decision that should be made at a personal or household level, not at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They participate in everyday activities, such as walking their dogs, and it's clear that they deserve the same rights as everyone else.\n\nI find it ridiculous when politicians try to impose their views on what marriage means. It's a chemical and biological aspect of human existence, and research suggests that people may be predisposed to being homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention, but gay couples face scrutiny and public debate. It's essential to treat marriage as a personal, private decision, rather than a matter of public interest or government policy.",

If you share sensitive or disturbing content, like threats or violent statements, it can be taken seriously and may lead to consequences.\n\nWhen something is posted online, it can spread quickly, and people may react based on what they see. In the case of a school, if someone reports a concerning post, administrators must act on it to ensure student safety. However, it can be challenging to determine what's a genuine threat and what's just a joke.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a recent situation at our school, where a student's online post was misinterpreted as a threat. After someone overheard a conversation and reported it, the school investigated and discovered the student's Facebook profile, which contained content that was initially meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone in the context of the situation.\n\nIt's essential to remember that once you post something online, there's no guarantee of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen or taken seriously, it's best not to post it in the first place. You can't control how others interpret your content or dictate what they should take seriously.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media or monitor their online activity, if a concerning post is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. However, I believe it's best not to have a personal connection with students online, as this can create a power imbalance and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I wouldn't create a fake social media account to connect with my residents, as this would blur the lines between our roles. Instead, I prefer to maintain a professional distance to avoid having to deal with sensitive or disturbing content that may arise from such a connection.",
            "I believe the war has been prolonged excessively, and its original intention to promote democracy has been lost sight of. While the initial goal of establishing a fair government in a country without one was commendable, it seems that personal vendettas, such as George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to go to war. \n\nIt's possible that the primary objective was achieved within the first few months, and the ongoing conflict has become a means to assert our nation's power rather than a genuine attempt to bring democracy to the region. The war has dragged on for far too long, and I think it's time for our military to disengage and allow the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. \n\nThe prolonged war has put a significant strain on our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's our duty to prioritize the needs of our own citizens and allocate our resources more effectively. The continued spending on a war that has lost its purpose is not only a drain on our economy but also a reminder of the devastating consequences of war, which should not be a long-term fixture in our national budget.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point by asking a question. The situation was potentially prevented because someone searched online and discovered that there was a risk. On platforms like Myspace, people post information that is accessible to anyone, as they are often public. The only way to access someone's profile is by becoming their friend, which implies that the person has given permission to see their information. Therefore, when someone posts on the internet, they should be aware that many people will see what they share. In this case, it's possible that someone's online activity was fortunate in preventing a serious situation.\n\nHowever, this raises some concerns. If one person is tasked with monitoring everyone's online activity, it could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals. It would be unfair to assume that only certain people are at risk and need to be monitored. The situation becomes even more complex when considering whether the person who found the online activity was specifically looking for potential threats or if it was just a coincidence.\n\nPersonally, I have concerns about online safety, as I know there are people who can access my information even without my consent. I had a disturbing experience watching a TV show where someone easily obtained a person's screen name and personal details online. This highlights the risks of sharing personal information online, even with controls in place. It's hard to balance the ease of communication with the need for safety and security.\n\nI've taken steps to limit what I share online, but I also don't want to restrict my online interactions too much. The issue is complex because I only accept people I know as friends online, but I'm not sure who else might be viewing my information.\n\nWhat struck me was a story my roommate shared about her high school experience, where students were banned from using Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what their students could or couldn't do online, and I don't know if that was a matter of privacy. That's the only other thought that comes to mind on this topic.",
            "There's an issue that I'd like to discuss, the Iraq War. It's a bit hypocritical of me to bring it up now, as I was initially against it, but I feel it's not as pressing anymore. The general consensus worldwide is that the invasion was a bad idea, except within the administration, where officials refuse to acknowledge their mistake. This is evident from recent polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, which show that approximately 75-80% of the world's population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq believe the war was a bad idea and that the US should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster since before the invasion, and withdrawal will likely be challenging as well. The main problem lies in the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries, making it difficult for the US administration to understand and adapt to the region's needs. The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "There's no doubt that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. When considering the issue, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not limited to women, but is also prevalent in various fields of work. Women often face unique challenges due to the so-called \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications and qualifications, they struggle to advance in their careers because of societal expectations and historical biases. This phenomenon is particularly evident when women are overlooked for promotions in favor of their male counterparts, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.\n\nHowever, the issue isn't exclusive to women. Men can also face discrimination, especially in industries like fashion, where societal norms dictate that men should not be interested in this field. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are often stereotyped and judged by society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and difficulty in pursuing their goals.\n\nMoreover, people from different regions or backgrounds may also face discrimination, not just based on their gender but also their geographical origins or socioeconomic status. For instance, individuals with non-standard grammar or speech patterns may be underestimated by their peers, even if they possess exceptional intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of the issue, where various factors can contribute to discrimination, including but not limited to, gender, location, and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address this issue, it's crucial to promote understanding and awareness of the diverse qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped and marginalized. Education and gradual exposure to different perspectives can help break down societal barriers and create a more inclusive environment. While change may be slow, it's essential to continue working towards a more equitable society, where individuals are judged based on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, background, or geographical location.\n\nBy fostering a culture of acceptance and promoting the value of different experiences and perspectives, we can work towards a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. This requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and stereotypes. While there may not be an immediate solution, gradual progress is possible, and it's essential to continue working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
            "In my understanding, marijuana was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a traffic ticket-worthy offense. This change reduces the severity of the consequences, such as avoiding arrest, booking, and court appearances. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term implications, like those associated with a drug charge, still exist. Although decriminalization can be beneficial, it's essential to consider the costs involved in arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals, which can be substantial. For financially struggling municipalities, the decision to decriminalize marijuana may be challenging, even if it could free up resources for other essential services.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded and liberal attitude, decriminalization is more acceptable. The financial benefits of decriminalization can be significant, allowing for investments in public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Nevertheless, there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of marijuana, such as its widespread availability and the potential for impaired driving. While marijuana may not have the same debilitating effects on motor skills as alcohol, it can still have a significant impact on people's lifestyles.\n\nInterestingly, people react differently to substances, and some are more prone to overindulgence, while others can exercise moderation. It's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, as individual reactions vary greatly. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, and a balanced approach to substance use is essential.",
            "I would say yes to some extent, however, there are certain concerns. A lot of traditional practices in the Catholic Church have been maintained for a long time, which is beneficial for grounding the institution. Nonetheless, it's also crucial for the Church to be adaptable to change. Unfortunately, this adaptability is not always evident.\n\nMany Catholics are expected to attend church regularly and adhere to strict rules, which can sometimes be perceived as judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. This intolerance can be seen in the fact that the Catholic Church doesn't accept individuals from other faiths or those who don't conform to its standards. For instance, my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to the latter's faith.\n\nThis disparity between the Church's teachings and its practices is puzzling. While Catholics are encouraged to love and accept others, the Church's actions often contradict this message, as seen in its treatment of people from other religions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of traditional practices in modern times.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it would be beneficial, but I'm not convinced it would prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilic behavior is a complex issue, and individuals who engage in it are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than focusing solely on the marital status of priests.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, and it's challenging to make a judgment without potentially offending someone. The issue of separating church and state, as well as defining marriage, is particularly delicate. I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed in a specific way by the government, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some. Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider it a civil union, which is essentially a union between two individuals. This way, the government wouldn't need to delve into the specifics of the marriage, such as whether it was performed by the church or not.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among states, it would be beneficial to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage is unwarranted, as it's not a significant enough issue to alter the Constitution. The Constitution should only be amended for fundamental, widely-held concerns, not for a cause that doesn't have broad enough support.\n\nIn essence, banning gay marriage doesn't warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's not a matter that should be taken up by the Constitution.",
            "I come from a Christian background, and as a result, I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have close gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle choices. However, I believe that homosexuality should be legalized and not a national issue decided by the president. I think it's better for each state to decide its own stance on the matter, rather than having a single national law.\n\nI understand that some states are more liberal and others more conservative, and it's natural for democratic states to support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or rejects gay marriage, it's your decision to accept or not accept that stance. I believe that individuals should have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. Therefore, I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the president should have the power to dictate how every state should govern, especially when it comes to issues like this. George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
            "When it comes to online platforms like Myspace, it's essential to remember that they are public spaces. If you post something on a public platform, you should be aware that it's accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. In this case, the school's actions were justified as they aimed to ensure student safety. Even if the students didn't post under the school's name, officials could still access their Myspace profiles from their homes. The school's primary responsibility is to protect its students, and if monitoring online activity helps prevent a school shooting or other safety issues, it's a necessary measure. \n\nSchool officials might use social media to track students who engage in behavior that's against school rules, such as underage drinking or smoking. While this could be seen as an invasion of privacy, it's a means to maintain a safer school environment. As long as their actions contribute to the well-being and safety of students, it's not an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn today's digital age, it's easy to assume that once something is posted online, it's permanent and can be accessed by anyone. This is why it's crucial to be cautious when expressing oneself online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. School officials and law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment for students, and monitoring social media is one way to achieve this goal. \n\nIn the case of the school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions were aimed at preventing potential harm, such as a school shooting like the one at Columbine. Their efforts were focused on creating a safer environment for students, which is a top priority. In this context, it's not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to protect students. \n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem invasive for school officials to monitor student social media activity, their primary goal is to ensure student safety and well-being. As long as their actions contribute to a safer environment, it's a justified measure. Students should be aware that anything posted online can have consequences, and school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for all students.",
            "Initially, I was strongly in favor of the war, especially due to the emotional impact of 9/11 on me personally. However, I now strongly disagree with the decision. I believe that our emotional response overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences, and we went into the war without a well-thought-out plan. As a result, our actions ultimately backfired. \n\nI think that as long as the groups in the region continue to fight among themselves, they will not pose a threat to us. Therefore, I don't think our presence in the area contributes to resolving their issues. Unfortunately, 9/11 has led me to become desensitized to the events in that region, and I struggle to care about what happens there.\n\nI sometimes question whether the people in the region can work together as a unified entity, as they consistently engage in internal conflicts. I believe that our approach to war differs significantly from theirs, and their methods can be brutal and focused on eliminating external threats rather than improving their own country. I think their primary goal was to have us leave, not to create a better future for themselves.\n\nI believe that our initial decision to go to war was largely driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations, I think a more thoughtful approach could have been taken. We could have developed a clearer plan for establishing order and rebuilding the region.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we went to war largely on an emotional impulse, which led to chaos and unintended consequences. It's clear that we are not equipped to change the fundamental nature of the people in that region. Despite some progress, I don't believe that our presence has been beneficial, and I think we will only continue to hinder our own interests by remaining there indefinitely.\n\nUltimately, I think it's time for us to admit that our intervention has not been effective and that the region's internal conflicts are unlikely to be resolved with our involvement. Therefore, I believe it's in our best interest to withdraw and focus on our own problems."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several ways, the Catholic Church may need to evolve in order to maintain its influence. The Church's strict views on certain issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, may be a major reason behind its declining following. These views are rooted in traditional teachings, but they often conflict with modern perspectives and values. \n\nAs a result, some people are starting to drift away from the Church, finding its stance on these issues to be outdated and out of touch. For instance, individuals who support abortion or same-sex marriage may feel uncomfortable following a Church that condemns these practices, and people who believe in these rights may not want to be part of a community that teaches that they are wrong.\n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and priests' marital status is another point of contention. While the Church views priests as being married to God, this concept is not necessarily relatable to the general population, where work and family life often go hand-in-hand. It's difficult to say whether allowing priests to marry or have female clergy would have altered the Church's stance on certain issues, but it's possible that it could have made the Church more relatable and appealing to a wider audience.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church may need to adapt its stance on these issues to avoid further alienating its followers and to stay relevant in modern society. By embracing a more inclusive and accepting attitude, the Church may be able to reclaim its influence and appeal to people who feel that its current views are no longer aligned with their values.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any objections to same-sex marriage. People who identify as gay aren't making a conscious decision about their sexual orientation; it's just who they are. Therefore, they shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual identity. It's unfair to deny two people of the same sex the right to get married when a man and a woman can. Upon reflection, I believe it's morally wrong to make such distinctions.\n\nIt's clear that a person's sexual orientation isn't a choice they make. Some people are born gay, just as others are born straight. This inherent aspect of a person's identity shouldn't be used to justify denying them their rights. In this context, I strongly disagree with holding gay individuals accountable for their sexual orientation.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the federal government shouldn't have a say in this matter. It's not a matter of national security or moral principles, but rather a personal issue that affects individuals. The government has no right to interfere in people's personal lives and dictate their relationships.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals are who they are, and they shouldn't be penalized for their natural identity. The government should respect their autonomy and not impose its authority in matters that have no bearing on national security or societal morals.",
            "I firmly believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there's no valid reason to deny it. Many people assume that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, but this notion is misguided. Gay relationships are distinct and diverse, and they shouldn't be judged solely based on comparisons to heterosexual relationships. It's essential to recognize that gay couples face various civil rights issues, such as unequal access to healthcare and property rights, which are often tied to the concept of marriage.\n\nFor instance, gay partners are often excluded from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and making important decisions on their behalf, simply because they're not considered family. This is unreasonable, especially considering that many gay couples are in long-term, committed relationships. Studies have shown that gay couples have similar rates of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples, suggesting that their relationships are not inherently different.\n\nThe core issue is not about church involvement, but rather about recognizing the right to a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government. If civil unions are permitted, why not marriage? It's like comparing segregation to inequality – they may seem different, but they're essentially the same.\n\nSome people worry about the impact of gay couples on communities and the potential effects on children, but these concerns are often unfounded. Research suggests that children raised by gay parents are not disproportionately affected, and they face many of the same challenges as children from heterosexual families. The main issue is not the orientation of their parents, but rather the way society treats them.\n\nIn fact, children from gay families often face bullying and marginalization in public schools, which can lead to serious problems. It's essential to recognize that parenting skills and values are not determined by a couple's sexual orientation. Ultimately, it's about treating people with respect and equality, regardless of their relationships.\n\nThe federal government should take a more active role in promoting gay marriage rights, and the proposed amendment banning it is misguided. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, like his views on abortion and stem cell research, may be influenced by his personal beliefs, but these should not be imposed on the entire nation.\n\nThe government should not impose its moral views on the population, especially when they contradict the values of other citizens. It's hypocritical to enforce laws based on certain religious groups' beliefs without considering the broader cultural and moral implications. The controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights this issue.\n\nSome people's opposition to gay marriage stems from misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality, such as trauma or personality defects. However, reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association have debunked these claims, and it's essential to rely on scientific research rather than popular opinions or cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Many people assume that because a substance is illegal, it must be entirely devoid of benefits. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. While I think making a substance available to the general public is a different story, I believe it should be considered for medicinal purposes. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances that are used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are proven to be beneficial. The fact that marijuana is illegal should not hinder its potential benefits. If we can accept the advantages of these controlled substances, then we should do the same for marijuana. \n\nThe comparison between marijuana and alcohol is not entirely relevant since marijuana can be abused, but so can alcohol. A more effective approach might be to legalize marijuana gradually, removing the existing stigma around it. This could encourage people to use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. \n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems from its illicit status. However, it is not as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the image of marijuana as a harmless substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially when it comes to medical applications.",
            "I think the church has already undergone significant changes to adapt to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. As I look back on my own experiences, I remember attending church every Sunday as a child and dressing up in matching outfits with my friends, who I would see at the private school I attended. However, the church has introduced a more casual atmosphere, with a 30-minute teenager mass and people dressing down, especially during summer, when some even wear beach clothes. This shift to a more relaxed environment is evident even in morning masses, where people now wear jeans and khakis instead of formal attire.\n\nAs for other noticeable changes, I believe the most significant one is the church's modernization. Although I'm not familiar with the church's internal politics, my observations suggest that this is the main change I've noticed. \n\nRegarding the allegations of pedophilia among Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. It's essential to note that some married individuals can still develop pedophilic tendencies, and the desire to engage in such behavior is rooted in their inherent nature, rather than their marital status. I think it's crucial to acknowledge that people's sexual orientation is largely determined by genetics, and it's not a result of their upbringing or environment. Thus, it's unlikely that the church's rules on marriage or priesthood would have made a significant difference in preventing these cases.\n\nIf the church was aware of the abuse and chose to cover it up, that's a separate issue, and they should be held accountable. However, if they were genuinely unaware, then it's not the church's policies that are to blame.\n\nAs for my thoughts on the Catholic Church, I don't have any other specific comments to add beyond these observations.",
            "(laughs) \nInitially, I was somewhat accepting of the Iraq war's premise, but I think the September 11th attacks had a profound impact on the nation's psyche, and the Bush administration used that as a pretext to invade Iraq, which I believe was not the primary reason for the invasion. The administration incorrectly linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, and falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This has left a lasting impression on me, as it is a clear example of the Bush administration's willingness to deceive the American people.\n\nIt's my opinion that the Bush administration has been remarkably transparent in its dishonesty towards the American public, and has yet to accept responsibility for these actions. Not even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now admits that he was not convinced by the evidence at the time. I believe this behavior is a severe breach of duty and constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, I think the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the US Constitution and attempted to marginalize it since the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe younger Bush administration's intentions to go to war seem to have been premeditated, with some even suggesting that he sought revenge for his father's administration. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his book, alleged that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, and was also driven by a desire to expand the US energy supply. This is a highly underhanded approach to governance.\n\nWhile I believe the Iraq war has gone on for far too long, an immediate withdrawal would likely lead to chaos and further bloodshed, given the risk of civil war. The UN and US are now exploring an alternative solution, involving a coalition of surrounding nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, I have doubts about this approach, as it may ultimately lead to issues regarding Iraq's sovereignty, particularly given the ineffectiveness of the current interim government and the power struggles within the Parliament.\n\nThe news reports suggest that the Parliament is dysfunctional, with the Prime Minister lacking control over the political process, and extremist elements vying for power. The presence of radical groups, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds significant seats in the Parliament, adds to the chaos and friction in the Iraqi political process.\n\nI struggle to articulate my concerns in polite company, but it's clear that the Iraq war has been a catastrophic failure and a grave mistake.",
            "The speaker expresses their thoughts on the War in Iraq, starting with a general sense of confusion and lack of knowledge about the conflict. They mention that the war was not officially declared by Congress and that it appears to be motivated by a desire to exact revenge against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the war's primary goal is to establish a democracy in Iraq, which they believe is unrealistic and would require a significant amount of time and resources. They also express concerns that the war is causing harm to the Iraqi people, displacing children and disrupting their education and daily lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker is conflicted about their opinions on the war. On one hand, they feel a sense of responsibility to support the soldiers fighting in Iraq, particularly those from families they know. On the other hand, they worry that the US presence in Iraq is perpetuating a cycle of violence and hatred towards the US, and that it is ultimately counterproductive.\n\nThe speaker draws a parallel with the Vietnam War, which they believe was also an undeclared war that is now widely regarded as a meaningless conflict. They express concerns that the US is repeating the same mistakes in Iraq, with the war becoming a long and costly endeavor that is damaging the country and its people.\n\nUltimately, the speaker is unsure about what to think about the war, acknowledging that it is a complex issue with no easy solutions. They suggest that the conflict will likely continue for many years to come, with no clear end in sight.",
            "I strongly believe that it's not the government's place to make it legal or illegal. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which allows for religious freedom and tolerance in the United States. Allowing the government to decide what's permissible or not within churches would be a direct disregard for this fundamental principle. This would be especially concerning if the government were to enforce its own preferences over those of other faiths. \n\nThe fact that some denominations, such as Catholics and Christians, have different views on this issue highlights the importance of leaving it up to individual churches to decide. The government should not impose its authority over sensitive matters of faith, which is a core aspect of the Constitution. \n\nIn fact, attempting to pass an amendment to restrict this freedom would be contradictory to the Constitution's existing provisions and would likely be the only amendment used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't believe that the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue, especially when there's no clear reason for an amendment other than personal beliefs.\n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment on the economy or society is unclear, but it's possible that it could even have a positive effect. Ultimately, the decision should rest with the churches, not with the government or its officials, who may be promoting their own personal views rather than the greater good.",
            "The Iraq war raises several questions about the honesty of the government in its decision-making process.  It appears that the administration may not have been entirely transparent with the American public about the true reasons for the invasion. The link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated, and the government exploited the emotional response to the attacks to justify the war. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, opposed it, especially a preemptive strike.\n\nThe Iraq war bears similarities to the Vietnam War, which the government should have learned from. Many American lives were lost, and the removal of the Iraqi government created a power vacuum that the administration was not prepared to handle. The US aimed to establish a democratic government in Iraq, just as it had attempted to do in Vietnam by removing the communist regime. However, the US government should have anticipated the difficulties and complexities involved in this process.\n\nIn hindsight, the administration was not adequately prepared for the aftermath of the invasion, and the occupation has been prolonged. The war has resulted in significant losses among American troops, and the training of Iraqi forces to maintain order has been a long and challenging process. The US government may have misled the public into believing that the invasion would be a relatively short and successful endeavor, which is not the case.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a complex issue, and the decision to involve the country in a conflict is rarely straightforward. The speaker was initially inclined to support George Bush in the 2004 presidential election to allow him to complete his term, but the prolonged occupation and high casualties have raised concerns. The war has also raised questions about the motivations behind the invasion, with some suggesting that oil interests were a primary factor.\n\nThe lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the administration's claims, and the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not targeted, has further eroded trust in the government's decision-making process. The speaker hopes for a swift resolution to the conflict and a peaceful resolution, but it seems unlikely.",
            "To be honest, I've always been in favor of gay marriage. I believe that a person's sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of who they are, and it's not something they can control. Scientific research has shown that it's likely linked to biology rather than societal factors. Considering this, it's inhumane to deny people their rights based on something they can't change.\n\nI think it's essential to keep politics and government out of personal matters, particularly when it comes to something as intimate as marriage. It's a private decision that should be made at a personal or household level, not at the state or national level. In my neighborhood, I've seen openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They participate in everyday activities, such as walking their dogs, and it's clear that they deserve the same rights as everyone else.\n\nI find it ridiculous when politicians try to impose their views on what marriage means. It's a chemical and biological aspect of human existence, and research suggests that people may be predisposed to being homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or family dynamics.\n\nIn my opinion, marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention, but gay couples face scrutiny and public debate. It's essential to treat marriage as a personal, private decision, rather than a matter of public interest or government policy.",

If you share sensitive or disturbing content, like threats or violent statements, it can be taken seriously and may lead to consequences.\n\nWhen something is posted online, it can spread quickly, and people may react based on what they see. In the case of a school, if someone reports a concerning post, administrators must act on it to ensure student safety. However, it can be challenging to determine what's a genuine threat and what's just a joke.\n\nThis was demonstrated in a recent situation at our school, where a student's online post was misinterpreted as a threat. After someone overheard a conversation and reported it, the school investigated and discovered the student's Facebook profile, which contained content that was initially meant as a joke but took on a more serious tone in the context of the situation.\n\nIt's essential to remember that once you post something online, there's no guarantee of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen or taken seriously, it's best not to post it in the first place. You can't control how others interpret your content or dictate what they should take seriously.\n\nWhile I don't think school officials should be friends with students on social media or monitor their online activity, if a concerning post is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. However, I believe it's best not to have a personal connection with students online, as this can create a power imbalance and make it difficult to maintain professional boundaries.\n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I wouldn't create a fake social media account to connect with my residents, as this would blur the lines between our roles. Instead, I prefer to maintain a professional distance to avoid having to deal with sensitive or disturbing content that may arise from such a connection.",
            "I believe the war has been prolonged excessively, and its original intention to promote democracy has been lost sight of. While the initial goal of establishing a fair government in a country without one was commendable, it seems that personal vendettas, such as George Bush's previous conflicts with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to go to war. \n\nIt's possible that the primary objective was achieved within the first few months, and the ongoing conflict has become a means to assert our nation's power rather than a genuine attempt to bring democracy to the region. The war has dragged on for far too long, and I think it's time for our military to disengage and allow the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. \n\nThe prolonged war has put a significant strain on our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's our duty to prioritize the needs of our own citizens and allocate our resources more effectively. The continued spending on a war that has lost its purpose is not only a drain on our economy but also a reminder of the devastating consequences of war, which should not be a long-term fixture in our national budget.",
            "I'd like to clarify a point by asking a question. The situation was potentially prevented because someone searched online and discovered that there was a risk. On platforms like Myspace, people post information that is accessible to anyone, as they are often public. The only way to access someone's profile is by becoming their friend, which implies that the person has given permission to see their information. Therefore, when someone posts on the internet, they should be aware that many people will see what they share. In this case, it's possible that someone's online activity was fortunate in preventing a serious situation.\n\nHowever, this raises some concerns. If one person is tasked with monitoring everyone's online activity, it could lead to unfair treatment of certain individuals. It would be unfair to assume that only certain people are at risk and need to be monitored. The situation becomes even more complex when considering whether the person who found the online activity was specifically looking for potential threats or if it was just a coincidence.\n\nPersonally, I have concerns about online safety, as I know there are people who can access my information even without my consent. I had a disturbing experience watching a TV show where someone easily obtained a person's screen name and personal details online. This highlights the risks of sharing personal information online, even with controls in place. It's hard to balance the ease of communication with the need for safety and security.\n\nI've taken steps to limit what I share online, but I also don't want to restrict my online interactions too much. The issue is complex because I only accept people I know as friends online, but I'm not sure who else might be viewing my information.\n\nWhat struck me was a story my roommate shared about her high school experience, where students were banned from using Myspace. I'm not sure how the school officials had the authority to dictate what their students could or couldn't do online, and I don't know if that was a matter of privacy. That's the only other thought that comes to mind on this topic.",
            "There's an issue that I'd like to discuss, the Iraq War. It's a bit hypocritical of me to bring it up now, as I was initially against it, but I feel it's not as pressing anymore. The general consensus worldwide is that the invasion was a bad idea, except within the administration, where officials refuse to acknowledge their mistake. This is evident from recent polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, which show that approximately 75-80% of the world's population, 80% of Iraqis, and 70% of US troops stationed in Iraq believe the war was a bad idea and that the US should withdraw within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been a disaster since before the invasion, and withdrawal will likely be challenging as well. The main problem lies in the cultural differences between the US and Middle Eastern countries, making it difficult for the US administration to understand and adapt to the region's needs. The idea of imposing democracy in areas where it's not wanted is a significant issue, and Saddam Hussein's regime was just one aspect of the complex situation. The US should have weighed the pros and cons before invading Iraq, considering the disastrous consequences that followed.\n\nI don't see a compelling reason to continue the occupation, and I'm skeptical of the administration's arguments for staying. If the US were to withdraw gradually over a year or more, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I fail to see why we shouldn't leave immediately. The Iraqis themselves are telling us to leave, with 80% wanting us to depart within a year and a quarter wanting us to leave now. It's likely that the people we're trying to help know better than we do, and if we ask them, they say leave, then it's not our fault if the situation deteriorates. By listening to the Iraqis, we can at least maintain a moral high ground, even if we're not the \"good guys\" in the Middle East.",
            "There's no doubt that gender discrimination still exists in the United States. When considering the issue, it's essential to acknowledge that it's not limited to women, but is also prevalent in various fields of work. Women often face unique challenges due to the so-called \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications and qualifications, they struggle to advance in their careers because of societal expectations and historical biases. This phenomenon is particularly evident when women are overlooked for promotions in favor of their male counterparts, even when they possess the necessary skills and experience.\n\nHowever, the issue isn't exclusive to women. Men can also face discrimination, especially in industries like fashion, where societal norms dictate that men should not be interested in this field. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home dads are often stereotyped and judged by society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to feelings of isolation and difficulty in pursuing their goals.\n\nMoreover, people from different regions or backgrounds may also face discrimination, not just based on their gender but also their geographical origins or socioeconomic status. For instance, individuals with non-standard grammar or speech patterns may be underestimated by their peers, even if they possess exceptional intelligence and capabilities. This highlights the complexity of the issue, where various factors can contribute to discrimination, including but not limited to, gender, location, and socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address this issue, it's crucial to promote understanding and awareness of the diverse qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped and marginalized. Education and gradual exposure to different perspectives can help break down societal barriers and create a more inclusive environment. While change may be slow, it's essential to continue working towards a more equitable society, where individuals are judged based on their capabilities and potential, rather than their gender, background, or geographical location.\n\nBy fostering a culture of acceptance and promoting the value of different experiences and perspectives, we can work towards a future where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or identity. This requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and stereotypes. While there may not be an immediate solution, gradual progress is possible, and it's essential to continue working towards a more inclusive and equitable society.",
            "In my understanding, marijuana was not fully legalized, but rather decriminalized, which means it's no longer considered a criminal offense, but rather a traffic ticket-worthy offense. This change reduces the severity of the consequences, such as avoiding arrest, booking, and court appearances. However, even with decriminalization, the long-term implications, like those associated with a drug charge, still exist. Although decriminalization can be beneficial, it's essential to consider the costs involved in arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals, which can be substantial. For financially struggling municipalities, the decision to decriminalize marijuana may be challenging, even if it could free up resources for other essential services.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there's a more open-minded and liberal attitude, decriminalization is more acceptable. The financial benefits of decriminalization can be significant, allowing for investments in public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Nevertheless, there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of marijuana, such as its widespread availability and the potential for impaired driving. While marijuana may not have the same debilitating effects on motor skills as alcohol, it can still have a significant impact on people's lifestyles.\n\nInterestingly, people react differently to substances, and some are more prone to overindulgence, while others can exercise moderation. It's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, as individual reactions vary greatly. However, it's clear that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, and a balanced approach to substance use is essential.",
            "I would say yes to some extent, however, there are certain concerns. A lot of traditional practices in the Catholic Church have been maintained for a long time, which is beneficial for grounding the institution. Nonetheless, it's also crucial for the Church to be adaptable to change. Unfortunately, this adaptability is not always evident.\n\nMany Catholics are expected to attend church regularly and adhere to strict rules, which can sometimes be perceived as judgmental towards those who don't follow the doctrine to the letter. This intolerance can be seen in the fact that the Catholic Church doesn't accept individuals from other faiths or those who don't conform to its standards. For instance, my parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to the latter's faith.\n\nThis disparity between the Church's teachings and its practices is puzzling. While Catholics are encouraged to love and accept others, the Church's actions often contradict this message, as seen in its treatment of people from other religions. This raises questions about the effectiveness of traditional practices in modern times.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it would be beneficial, but I'm not convinced it would prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilic behavior is a complex issue, and individuals who engage in it are likely to do so regardless of their marital status. It's essential to address the root causes of such behavior rather than focusing solely on the marital status of priests.",
            "I'm still undecided on this matter, and it's challenging to make a judgment without potentially offending someone. The issue of separating church and state, as well as defining marriage, is particularly delicate. I'm not convinced that marriage should be viewed in a specific way by the government, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some. Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider it a civil union, which is essentially a union between two individuals. This way, the government wouldn't need to delve into the specifics of the marriage, such as whether it was performed by the church or not.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among states, it would be beneficial to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to prohibit gay marriage is unwarranted, as it's not a significant enough issue to alter the Constitution. The Constitution should only be amended for fundamental, widely-held concerns, not for a cause that doesn't have broad enough support.\n\nIn essence, banning gay marriage doesn't warrant a constitutional amendment, and it's not a matter that should be taken up by the Constitution.",
            "I come from a Christian background, and as a result, I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have close gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle choices. However, I believe that homosexuality should be legalized and not a national issue decided by the president. I think it's better for each state to decide its own stance on the matter, rather than having a single national law.\n\nI understand that some states are more liberal and others more conservative, and it's natural for democratic states to support gay marriage. If you choose to live in a state that allows or rejects gay marriage, it's your decision to accept or not accept that stance. I believe that individuals should have the same rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation. Therefore, I think it should be up to each state to decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the president should have the power to dictate how every state should govern, especially when it comes to issues like this. George W. Bush's stance on gay marriage is not something I agree with, and I think it's up to individual states to decide their own laws and policies. As it stands, the ban on gay marriage is likely to change with a shift in the presidency, so it's better to let each state decide its own path.\n\nUltimately, I think some issues should be left to the discretion of each state, rather than being decided by a single authority figure. States will have to live with the consequences of their decisions, so it's better to give them the freedom to make their own choices.",
            "When it comes to online platforms like Myspace, it's essential to remember that they are public spaces. If you post something on a public platform, you should be aware that it's accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. In this case, the school's actions were justified as they aimed to ensure student safety. Even if the students didn't post under the school's name, officials could still access their Myspace profiles from their homes. The school's primary responsibility is to protect its students, and if monitoring online activity helps prevent a school shooting or other safety issues, it's a necessary measure. \n\nSchool officials might use social media to track students who engage in behavior that's against school rules, such as underage drinking or smoking. While this could be seen as an invasion of privacy, it's a means to maintain a safer school environment. As long as their actions contribute to the well-being and safety of students, it's not an invasion of privacy. \n\nIn today's digital age, it's easy to assume that once something is posted online, it's permanent and can be accessed by anyone. This is why it's crucial to be cautious when expressing oneself online, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. School officials and law enforcement agencies have a responsibility to ensure a safe environment for students, and monitoring social media is one way to achieve this goal. \n\nIn the case of the school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions were aimed at preventing potential harm, such as a school shooting like the one at Columbine. Their efforts were focused on creating a safer environment for students, which is a top priority. In this context, it's not an invasion of privacy, but rather a necessary measure to protect students. \n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem invasive for school officials to monitor student social media activity, their primary goal is to ensure student safety and well-being. As long as their actions contribute to a safer environment, it's a justified measure. Students should be aware that anything posted online can have consequences, and school officials have a responsibility to maintain a safe and secure environment for all students.",
            "Initially, I was strongly in favor of the war, especially due to the emotional impact of 9/11 on me personally. However, I now strongly disagree with the decision. I believe that our emotional response overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences, and we went into the war without a well-thought-out plan. As a result, our actions ultimately backfired. \n\nI think that as long as the groups in the region continue to fight among themselves, they will not pose a threat to us. Therefore, I don't think our presence in the area contributes to resolving their issues. Unfortunately, 9/11 has led me to become desensitized to the events in that region, and I struggle to care about what happens there.\n\nI sometimes question whether the people in the region can work together as a unified entity, as they consistently engage in internal conflicts. I believe that our approach to war differs significantly from theirs, and their methods can be brutal and focused on eliminating external threats rather than improving their own country. I think their primary goal was to have us leave, not to create a better future for themselves.\n\nI believe that our initial decision to go to war was largely driven by a desire for revenge following 9/11. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations, I think a more thoughtful approach could have been taken. We could have developed a clearer plan for establishing order and rebuilding the region.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we went to war largely on an emotional impulse, which led to chaos and unintended consequences. It's clear that we are not equipped to change the fundamental nature of the people in that region. Despite some progress, I don't believe that our presence has been beneficial, and I think we will only continue to hinder our own interests by remaining there indefinitely.\n\nUltimately, I think it's time for us to admit that our intervention has not been effective and that the region's internal conflicts are unlikely to be resolved with our involvement. Therefore, I believe it's in our best interest to withdraw and focus on our own problems."
