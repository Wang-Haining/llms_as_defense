            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to undergo some changes in certain aspects. The decline in followers is partly due to the Church's inflexibility regarding various issues. For instance, its views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are often perceived as outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern approach, it might be able to retain its followers. \n\nAs it stands, some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because its stance on these issues doesn't align with their own values. For individuals who believe in the right to abortion or support gay marriage, being part of a community where these practices are condemned can be uncomfortable. \n\nThe Church's stance against abortion and its disapproval of gay marriage might drive away those who hold different views. It's also worth considering the Church's stance on female priests and married priests. While some may argue that allowing priests to be married or having female priests could have prevented past issues, it's difficult to say for certain. \n\nThe Catholic Church views its priests as being married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, this is unlike any other profession, where individuals have a life outside of work. It seems unreasonable that priests cannot have a similar balance of work and personal life.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any personal objections to gay marriage. In my opinion, a person's sexual orientation is not something they can choose; it's a natural part of who they are. Therefore, I believe that gay individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to deny them the right to marry, just as it would be wrong to deny someone the right to marry because of their skin color or any other innate trait.\n\nI think the idea that someone's sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception. Just as we are born with certain physical and emotional characteristics, some people are naturally attracted to the same sex. It's not something they can change or control.\n\nI don't think it's the government's place to dictate who can and cannot get married, especially when it comes to something as personal as sexual orientation. This issue is not about national security, morality, or any other government concern; it's simply about allowing individuals to make their own choices about who they love and want to spend their lives with.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or punished for their natural orientation. It's essential to respect and accept people for who they are, rather than trying to change or control them.",
            "In my opinion, gay marriage should be legalized without any reservations. The main reason for this is that there is no valid argument against it. Some people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is misguided. The concept of same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. However, both types of relationships share many commonalities and should be treated with the same respect.\n\nOne of the primary concerns surrounding gay marriage is the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners, particularly in situations where one partner requires medical attention. Currently, same-sex partners are not considered family members and are often denied the right to visit their loved ones in hospitals or make important medical decisions. This is unfair, especially considering that many same-sex relationships can be just as fulfilling and enduring as opposite-sex relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as opposite-sex couples. They also face similar challenges and have the same desires for commitment and companionship.\n\nThe main issue at hand is not about religious objections to same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing the rights of same-sex couples in a legal context. Gay couples are not seeking to get married in a church, but rather to obtain a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is \"separate but unequal\" is particularly problematic. Denying same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is discriminatory and unjust. Many people worry about the impact of gay marriage on children and communities, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, research has shown that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as children raised by straight parents. Moreover, the main issue with adoption is not the sexual orientation of the adoptive parents, but rather the way society treats children with same-sex parents.\n\nIn some cases, children of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in schools, highlighting the need for greater understanding and acceptance. However, this does not mean that gay parents are inherently flawed or that their children are at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the federal government should take a proactive role in making gay marriage legal across all states. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is morally and ethically flawed, as it ignores the diversity of American culture and values. Rather than imposing a single, narrow perspective on the nation, our government should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all citizens.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to recognize that people's views on morality and gay rights vary greatly, and it's not fair to impose one group's beliefs on the rest of society. The American Psychological Association has already debunked the myth that being gay is a result of psychological damage or trauma, and it's time for people to listen to credible research and evidence rather than relying on unverified opinions and cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've come to realize that the fact a drug is prohibited doesn't necessarily mean it lacks potential benefits. While I believe it shouldn't be accessible to the general public, I think its therapeutic potential should be acknowledged. Many controlled substances used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are also considered illegal but are still utilized due to their benefits. Therefore, I think we should not dismiss the potential advantages of marijuana solely because of the stigma surrounding it. \n\nIt's worth noting that marijuana's potential for abuse is often compared to that of alcohol, which can also lead to negative consequences when misused. However, I don't think they're comparable in this context. Perhaps what we need is a gradual introduction of marijuana's use, allowing people to become more familiar with it and potentially use it responsibly. This would require a shift in public perception and the removal of the negative image associated with marijuana. By doing so, we can encourage its use for medicinal purposes while minimizing the risk of abuse. Many people have a misguided view of marijuana due to its current illicit status, but it's not as detrimental as other substances like heroin or cocaine. By changing this public perception, we can promote responsible use of marijuana for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the changing times of the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. When I was younger, I would regularly attend church on Sundays, dressing up in matching outfits with my friends from a private school. However, the church has since introduced shorter masses, often lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer when beachwear is common. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere has become more noticeable, even in morning masses where I used to dress up. \n\nRegarding the recent scandals surrounding Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are still men who, despite being married or unmarried, have a predilection for children. It's not necessarily the institution of marriage or celibacy that contributes to this issue, but rather the individual's inherent nature. Some other faiths permit married clergy, yet cases of pedophilia still occur, suggesting that personal choices and genetics play a significant role.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientations and tendencies may be determined by genetics, and cannot be changed by external factors, such as upbringings or institutions. This means that the church's rules about marriage and celibacy might not be the primary cause of these issues. If the church was aware of and tried to conceal these incidents, that's a different matter altogether, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules had a significant impact on the prevalence of pedophilia among its clergy.",
            "The speaker initially found the idea acceptable but felt that the timing of the Iraq invasion was problematic, coming as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks. They believe the Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, despite the claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This deception, particularly Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, has left a lasting negative impression on the speaker. They view the administration's actions as a disregard for the Constitution and an attempt to marginalize it.\n\nThe speaker also suggests that the Bush administration had a predetermined desire for war, with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from a perceived slight against his father and a desire to expand the US energy supply. They feel that the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more bloodshed.\n\nThe proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order in Iraq is seen as problematic, as it may infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty and lead to long-term issues with the interim government's effectiveness. The speaker expresses skepticism about the ability of the current Parliament to function and notes the influence of radical elements in the political process, which could lead to further instability.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, viewing their actions as a betrayal of the public trust and a disregard for the Constitution. They are uncertain about the best course of action, recognizing that any decision will likely have far-reaching consequences.",
            "The conversation revolves around the speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, they express confusion about the war, stating that it wasn't formally declared by Congress, which they believe is a requirement for a war to be considered a legitimate one. They also mention that the war was likely a response to the 9/11 attacks, and that the primary goals are to establish democracy and secure access to oil resources.\n\nHowever, the speaker feels that these objectives are not justified, as the war has caused widespread suffering and upset. They mention that staying in Iraq would lead to a lengthy and difficult process of building democracy, which is unlikely to succeed. If the US were to withdraw, Iraqis might be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, potentially leading to further resentment towards the US.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears, suggesting that the war should continue because it wouldn't be fair to pull out now. They argue that the conflict is not a \"war\" in the classical sense, but rather a demonstration of US military power. They also express sympathy for President Bush, who they believe is being unfairly criticized for the war's outcome.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the complexity of the situation, with the speaker acknowledging the importance of considering the human cost of the conflict, particularly for families with loved ones serving in Iraq. However, they also worry that US involvement is exacerbating the situation and creating further divisions within Iraqi society. They fear that attempting to impose American values and democracy on Iraq could ultimately lead to more harm and create an even stronger sense of anti-American sentiment.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the conflict will likely drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly disagree with the idea of making it a law or allowing the state to declare it as legal, as I believe it's a matter that should be left to the discretion of churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which is crucial for maintaining religious tolerance in the United States. Attempting to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing for its illegality are unfairly imposing their own church's beliefs on others, as many Christians and Catholics oppose it. Instead, the government should respect the autonomy of churches to decide what is and isn't acceptable. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for diverse religious practices and beliefs.\n\nMaking an amendment to address this issue would be misguided and contradictory to the constitution's existing principles. Moreover, it would be one of the rare instances where the government would be restricting the people rather than itself. I believe it's not the government's place to intervene in this matter, especially when their motivations seem to be driven by personal biases rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nThe president's push for this amendment appears to be rooted in his personal Catholic beliefs, which would unfairly favor one religion over others. There's no substantial reason to support an amendment that would restrict the freedom of churches, as it wouldn't have a significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society by allowing religious tolerance to flourish.\n\nOverall, I believe the decision should be left to the churches, and the government should refrain from imposing its will on this issue.",
            "The Iraq War was a complex and contentious issue. From the outset, there were concerns that the US government was not entirely transparent about the reasons for the invasion. It seemed that the government attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to manipulate public emotions, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, were against it, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.\n\nIn some ways, the Iraq War resembled the Vietnam War, where the US government attempted to impose a democratic government on a foreign nation. However, history had shown that such efforts often led to a long and challenging process, with significant loss of life and difficulty in establishing stability. The US government seemed unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, including the power vacuum and ensuing chaos.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was seen as a way to establish democracy, similar to the US government's goals in Vietnam. However, the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of winning the hearts and minds of the local population were grossly underestimated. The presence of insurgents and the need to fight against a civilian population made the conflict much harder to win.\n\nThe speaker believes that the US government should not have entered the war without proper planning for various outcomes. The aftermath of the invasion was not given sufficient consideration, and the country is still struggling with instability and violence nearly a decade later. Many American soldiers have lost their lives in the conflict, and the training of Iraqi security forces has been a slow and arduous process.\n\nThe speaker questions the true motives behind the invasion, suggesting that the US government may have been driven by self-interest, particularly the desire to control Iraq's oil resources. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as well as the government's willingness to tolerate similar threats from other nations (such as North Korea), has led to suspicions of deception and a lack of thoroughness in decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the speaker hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict, but is uncertain if this will come to pass.",
            "For me, the issue of gay marriage is quite clear-cut – I've always been in favor of it. I think it's a matter of personal preference, and research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological basis rather than being determined by societal factors. It would be inhumane to deny individuals rights based on something beyond their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government and politics should not interfere with this personal choice.\n\nIn fact, this issue is not even a matter of state or national politics; it's a personal matter that affects individuals and their families. In my own neighborhood, I've seen several openly gay couples who lead their lives just like any other family, contributing to their community in the same way. However, they are unable to get married due to laws that prevent them from doing so. I find it absurd that politicians, like President Bush, attempt to redefine the concept of marriage according to their own interpretations.\n\nRecent studies suggest that homosexuality may be influenced by a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than by upbringing or environmental factors. For instance, a person might be predisposed to being homosexual regardless of whether they have siblings or a father figure. This highlights the biological aspect of sexual orientation, rather than any sociological influence.\n\nFrom my perspective, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a public or federal issue. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention to themselves, but if a gay couple wants to get married, it becomes a national news story. This disparity is unacceptable, and I believe that marriage should be treated as a personal, private matter, rather than a public concern.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public information that anyone can access, including your school. As a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand how this can lead to issues. Posts about violence or threats can lead people to have a negative opinion of you, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they might share your content with others, including school officials.\n\nIn the case that occurred at my school, a student overheard someone mentioning something concerning and reported it to the authorities. When they investigated, they found concerning content on the student's social media profiles that could have been taken as a joke in a different context. This highlights the importance of being mindful of what you share online, as there's no expectation of privacy once it's out there.\n\nIf you don't want people to see something, don't post it online. You can't control what others think or how they react to your content. While I don't think it's right for school officials to be friends with students on social media and monitoring their online activity, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.\n\nIn fact, I think it's a good idea for teachers and RAs to maintain a professional boundary with their students by not creating fake social media accounts or friending them on those platforms. If you're in a position of authority, it's best to avoid being connected to your students' personal lives, as it can create unnecessary complications and responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, the internet is a public forum, and what you post can have real-world consequences. Be careful about what you share online, and be aware of the potential impact it can have on your relationships and reputation.",
            "The conflict has dragged on for an unnecessarily long period. While the initial objective of establishing democracy in another nation was commendable, it appears that this goal has been lost sight of over time. The war seems to have become a means to assert global dominance rather than a genuine attempt to bring about positive change. The motivations behind the war, particularly considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, are also questionable.\n\nIn my opinion, if the primary intention was to introduce democracy to a country with an unfair system, then that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal agendas played a significant role, it would be unfair. It's clear that the war's purpose has been distorted over time, and the conflict has become a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nI believe that the initial stages of the war served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged duration has been excessive. We've been pouring billions of dollars into the conflict, diverting funds away from pressing domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's crucial that we reassess our priorities and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nThe war has already lasted for an extended period, and it's time for the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. We should withdraw our support and redirect the funds to address our own internal problems. The financial burden of this conflict is substantial, and it's essential that we utilize our resources more effectively, focusing on pressing domestic issues rather than propping up a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "The person would like to clarify that they don't think it's an invasion of privacy if someone finds information online. They argue that when you post content on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone, as seen on platforms like Myspace where profiles are only visible to friends. By adding someone as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to view your profile. Therefore, individuals should be aware that a significant number of people may see the information they post online.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes more complex when considering how to balance individual freedom with the potential consequences. While it's not feasible for one person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent harm, it could be seen as unfair to single out certain individuals for scrutiny. The situation also raises questions about the role of social media monitoring in schools and whether it's appropriate for authorities to restrict students' access to platforms like Myspace.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experience with Facebook and concerns about online safety. They mention a disturbing example of someone using a social media platform to gather information about a person and manipulate them into meeting. This highlights the potential risks of sharing personal details online, making it challenging to strike a balance between maintaining online presence and protecting one's anonymity.\n\nThe speaker also brings up a story about their roommate's high school, where students were banned from using Myspace. They question the authority of school officials to restrict students' online activities, suggesting that this may have been an overreach regarding individual privacy. The speaker concludes by expressing uncertainty about the school's right to dictate what online platforms students can use.",
            "Reflecting on the Iraq War, I'm hesitant to share my views due to the common criticism of jumping on the bandwagon of those who opposed it from the start. However, I did express my opposition initially, and it's not a pressing concern anymore now that the general consensus worldwide has solidified that the war was ill-conceived, except within the administration, which struggles to acknowledge their mistakes.\n\nA global survey of public opinion reveals a stark reality: a significant majority, ranging from 75% to 80%, across the world, the US, and Iraq, believe the war was a poor decision. Even US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, think it was a misguided effort and advocate for a speedy withdrawal within a year. This widespread opposition underscores the war's disastrous consequences from the outset, which have continued to escalate since the US involvement.\n\nThe issue boils down to a profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations, which previous administrations have struggled to bridge. The notion that the US can impose democracy on a region that has its own unique values and preferences is misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a malevolent leader, the decision to invade Iraq wasn't taken lightly, and the costs have been devastating.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq remains dire, it's challenging to justify continued US presence. While the administration might propose potential benefits of staying, I haven't been convinced by their arguments. If anything, a gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer wouldn't be unreasonable. In fact, the majority of Iraqis, approximately 80%, believe the US should leave within a year, and a significant segment, at least 25%, advocate for an immediate withdrawal.\n\nConsidering that the very people the US is trying to help are urging them to leave, it's worth taking their opinions seriously. If the US were to ask for their input and they requested withdrawal, it would absolve the US of responsibility if things were to deteriorate further. If the US were to decide to assist Iraq after that, it would at least be seen as a more benevolent action than the current situation. Although, it's unlikely the US will ever be viewed as a benevolent force in the Middle East, this course of action would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While it's true that the United States has made progress in addressing gender discrimination, I still believe it's a significant issue that affects various aspects of society. The problem isn't limited to women, as men also face challenges, particularly in industries where traditional gender roles are prevalent. For instance, in the corporate world, women often struggle to advance to senior positions due to the \"glass ceiling,\" despite their qualifications, because of societal expectations and outdated stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often face criticism and judgment from others, who view it as unusual for men to be primary caregivers. This can be particularly challenging for stay-at-home dads who may have always envisioned themselves in this role. The fashion industry is another area where men are often stereotyped and may not be taken seriously if they're interested in fashion.\n\nHowever, it's heartening to see that there are positive changes taking place. As more women break into leadership positions and become CEOs, they're helping to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes. Moreover, stay-at-home dads are becoming increasingly accepted as primary caregivers, and men in the fashion industry are being taken more seriously. But changing societal attitudes takes time, and it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals in non-traditional roles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other forms of discrimination, such as socioeconomic background and geographical location, can also affect individuals, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area with limited educational opportunities may face prejudice from others in the corporate world, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Ultimately, addressing these complex issues requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the various factors at play and promotes understanding, acceptance, and equality.",
            "It seems that decriminalizing marijuana has reduced its classification from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction similar to a traffic ticket, eliminating the need for arrest and detention. However, this change does not entirely eliminate the potential consequences of being caught, such as affecting job prospects and future opportunities. Although proponents argue that decriminalization can help reduce costs associated with prosecution, law enforcement, and the judicial system, some municipalities may be hesitant to adopt this approach due to philosophical or financial concerns.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there is a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization has led to a significant increase in revenue that can be allocated towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and support for the homeless. On the other hand, some people worry that full legalization could lead to a similar situation as cigarette sales, with marijuana being freely available and potentially contributing to impaired driving and societal disapproval.\n\nIt's worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. However, individuals react differently to substances, and some may be more prone to overindulgence than others. While it's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, it's clear that it can have significant impacts on people's lives, particularly when used excessively. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana use depends on various factors, including the individual's personality and behavior.",
            "I would say that the Catholic Church has a mix of traditional practices and a need to adapt to change. While it's beneficial to draw from its rich history, it's also essential to be flexible and open to new ideas. However, the Church's stance on certain issues seems contradictory. On one hand, it emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching. On the other hand, it often appears to be intolerant of those who don't adhere to its doctrine or come from different faiths.\n\nFor instance, my own family experienced this intolerance firsthand when my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's non-Catholic background. This behavior is hypocritical, as it contradicts the Church's message of acceptance and love.\n\nAdditionally, some Catholic teachings seem to be outdated and don't align with the values they promote. Despite this, the Church continues to stick to these practices. I personally believe that allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, but I'm not convinced that it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilia is a complex issue that likely stems from more than just marital status, and those who would engage in such behavior are unlikely to be deterred by marriage.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that child abuse can happen regardless of whether a priest is married or not. The root of the issue is not the priest's marital status but rather the underlying behavior and circumstances. Therefore, allowing priests to marry is unlikely to be a solution to this problem.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and I don't think I can take a stance on whether one side is right or wrong. This topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage, which can be a sensitive subject. \n\nIt's difficult to approach this without potentially offending someone, and the concept of marriage is quite complex. I'm not convinced that the government should be involved in defining what constitutes a marriage, especially considering it's often considered a sacrament. If two people are married, they should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs, and shouldn't be subject to different tax benefits or government recognition based on their baptism. \n\nIn theory, marriage should be viewed as a civil union between two consenting adults, rather than something that's defined by the government or a specific church. The concept of gay marriage, in this context, is essentially the same as a civil union between two people. \n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it would be logical to push for federal recognition of this. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage. This issue doesn't have the significance or the broad support needed to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a matter of constitutional importance, and the constitution should not be altered to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to some ambivalence towards homosexuality. However, having close friendships with gay individuals has made me more understanding, even if I don't fully agree with their lifestyle choices. While I don't think it should be a national issue, I believe each state should have the autonomy to decide on the legalization of gay marriage, rather than the federal government imposing a single decision. This approach reflects the diverse nature of the United States, where both Democratic and Republican states have varying views on the matter. If someone chooses to live in a state that has legalized gay marriage, they should respect the local decision, as it is a choice they made. In my opinion, homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, and the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. Furthermore, as President Bush's ban on gay marriage is a national decision, it's unreasonable for him to impose his views on every state, considering he doesn't live in every state and will be out of office soon. Ultimately, decisions like this should be left to the states, as they will be directly affected by the outcome, not the president.",
            "I don't think Myspace should be considered a private space, given that it's a public platform. When you post something online, you have to expect that others, including school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. In the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe it's perfectly reasonable for school officials to monitor online activity if it makes the school a safer place.\n\nWhile I understand concerns about privacy, if monitoring online activity leads to the prevention of a school shooting or makes the school a better and safer environment, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, schools often take measures to ensure student safety, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness, which can be related to preventing incidents like school shootings.\n\nIt's true that anything posted online can be accessed and potentially used against someone in the future, but this doesn't necessarily make it an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safe school environment. School officials may monitor online activity to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, but this can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent harm and create a safer school environment.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between monitoring online activity and respecting students' privacy. If school officials have evidence that leads to a specific concern, such as a student engaging in prohibited behavior, it's reasonable for them to investigate further. However, randomly searching through students' online activity without cause can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and monitoring online activity can be a means to achieve this goal. However, it's essential to do so in a manner that respects students' rights to privacy and doesn't unfairly target individuals.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure school environment, not to unfairly target students or invade their privacy.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of the war due to my personal connection to 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation, I believe that the emotional response at the time led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term consequences. As a result, we entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately led to negative outcomes. I now strongly oppose the war and do not think it achieved its intended goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in the affected region are currently preoccupied with internal conflicts and are unable to focus on fighting against external threats. Therefore, our presence in the area is unlikely to have a significant impact on the situation. Unfortunately, my experiences with the aftermath of 9/11 have led me to become desensitized to the situation in the region, and I struggle to muster concern for their plight.\n\nI believe that the concept of war differs significantly between us and the people in the region, with their approach being more brutal and less focused on nation-building. I think they are mainly driven by a desire to expel foreign forces, and I am open to the idea of withdrawing our troops.\n\nIn hindsight, I think our decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. President Bush made a decision to declare war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations at the time, I believe we could have approached the situation with more caution and a clearer plan.\n\nI think it's unlikely that we can fundamentally change the people in the region, as their culture and ways of life are deeply ingrained. Our presence has not brought about significant progress, and I believe it's counterproductive to continue our involvement. In fact, I think it's only a matter of time before the situation collapses once we leave, and we risk harming ourselves by prolonging our stay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to undergo some changes in certain aspects. The decline in followers is partly due to the Church's inflexibility regarding various issues. For instance, its views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are often perceived as outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern approach, it might be able to retain its followers. \n\nAs it stands, some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because its stance on these issues doesn't align with their own values. For individuals who believe in the right to abortion or support gay marriage, being part of a community where these practices are condemned can be uncomfortable. \n\nThe Church's stance against abortion and its disapproval of gay marriage might drive away those who hold different views. It's also worth considering the Church's stance on female priests and married priests. While some may argue that allowing priests to be married or having female priests could have prevented past issues, it's difficult to say for certain. \n\nThe Catholic Church views its priests as being married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, this is unlike any other profession, where individuals have a life outside of work. It seems unreasonable that priests cannot have a similar balance of work and personal life.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any personal objections to gay marriage. In my opinion, a person's sexual orientation is not something they can choose; it's a natural part of who they are. Therefore, I believe that gay individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to deny them the right to marry, just as it would be wrong to deny someone the right to marry because of their skin color or any other innate trait.\n\nI think the idea that someone's sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception. Just as we are born with certain physical and emotional characteristics, some people are naturally attracted to the same sex. It's not something they can change or control.\n\nI don't think it's the government's place to dictate who can and cannot get married, especially when it comes to something as personal as sexual orientation. This issue is not about national security, morality, or any other government concern; it's simply about allowing individuals to make their own choices about who they love and want to spend their lives with.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or punished for their natural orientation. It's essential to respect and accept people for who they are, rather than trying to change or control them.",
            "In my opinion, gay marriage should be legalized without any reservations. The main reason for this is that there is no valid argument against it. Some people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is misguided. The concept of same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. However, both types of relationships share many commonalities and should be treated with the same respect.\n\nOne of the primary concerns surrounding gay marriage is the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners, particularly in situations where one partner requires medical attention. Currently, same-sex partners are not considered family members and are often denied the right to visit their loved ones in hospitals or make important medical decisions. This is unfair, especially considering that many same-sex relationships can be just as fulfilling and enduring as opposite-sex relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as opposite-sex couples. They also face similar challenges and have the same desires for commitment and companionship.\n\nThe main issue at hand is not about religious objections to same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing the rights of same-sex couples in a legal context. Gay couples are not seeking to get married in a church, but rather to obtain a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is \"separate but unequal\" is particularly problematic. Denying same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is discriminatory and unjust. Many people worry about the impact of gay marriage on children and communities, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, research has shown that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as children raised by straight parents. Moreover, the main issue with adoption is not the sexual orientation of the adoptive parents, but rather the way society treats children with same-sex parents.\n\nIn some cases, children of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in schools, highlighting the need for greater understanding and acceptance. However, this does not mean that gay parents are inherently flawed or that their children are at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the federal government should take a proactive role in making gay marriage legal across all states. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is morally and ethically flawed, as it ignores the diversity of American culture and values. Rather than imposing a single, narrow perspective on the nation, our government should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all citizens.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to recognize that people's views on morality and gay rights vary greatly, and it's not fair to impose one group's beliefs on the rest of society. The American Psychological Association has already debunked the myth that being gay is a result of psychological damage or trauma, and it's time for people to listen to credible research and evidence rather than relying on unverified opinions and cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've come to realize that the fact a drug is prohibited doesn't necessarily mean it lacks potential benefits. While I believe it shouldn't be accessible to the general public, I think its therapeutic potential should be acknowledged. Many controlled substances used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are also considered illegal but are still utilized due to their benefits. Therefore, I think we should not dismiss the potential advantages of marijuana solely because of the stigma surrounding it. \n\nIt's worth noting that marijuana's potential for abuse is often compared to that of alcohol, which can also lead to negative consequences when misused. However, I don't think they're comparable in this context. Perhaps what we need is a gradual introduction of marijuana's use, allowing people to become more familiar with it and potentially use it responsibly. This would require a shift in public perception and the removal of the negative image associated with marijuana. By doing so, we can encourage its use for medicinal purposes while minimizing the risk of abuse. Many people have a misguided view of marijuana due to its current illicit status, but it's not as detrimental as other substances like heroin or cocaine. By changing this public perception, we can promote responsible use of marijuana for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the changing times of the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. When I was younger, I would regularly attend church on Sundays, dressing up in matching outfits with my friends from a private school. However, the church has since introduced shorter masses, often lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer when beachwear is common. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere has become more noticeable, even in morning masses where I used to dress up. \n\nRegarding the recent scandals surrounding Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are still men who, despite being married or unmarried, have a predilection for children. It's not necessarily the institution of marriage or celibacy that contributes to this issue, but rather the individual's inherent nature. Some other faiths permit married clergy, yet cases of pedophilia still occur, suggesting that personal choices and genetics play a significant role.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientations and tendencies may be determined by genetics, and cannot be changed by external factors, such as upbringings or institutions. This means that the church's rules about marriage and celibacy might not be the primary cause of these issues. If the church was aware of and tried to conceal these incidents, that's a different matter altogether, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules had a significant impact on the prevalence of pedophilia among its clergy.",
            "The speaker initially found the idea acceptable but felt that the timing of the Iraq invasion was problematic, coming as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks. They believe the Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, despite the claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This deception, particularly Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, has left a lasting negative impression on the speaker. They view the administration's actions as a disregard for the Constitution and an attempt to marginalize it.\n\nThe speaker also suggests that the Bush administration had a predetermined desire for war, with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from a perceived slight against his father and a desire to expand the US energy supply. They feel that the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more bloodshed.\n\nThe proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order in Iraq is seen as problematic, as it may infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty and lead to long-term issues with the interim government's effectiveness. The speaker expresses skepticism about the ability of the current Parliament to function and notes the influence of radical elements in the political process, which could lead to further instability.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, viewing their actions as a betrayal of the public trust and a disregard for the Constitution. They are uncertain about the best course of action, recognizing that any decision will likely have far-reaching consequences.",
            "The conversation revolves around the speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, they express confusion about the war, stating that it wasn't formally declared by Congress, which they believe is a requirement for a war to be considered a legitimate one. They also mention that the war was likely a response to the 9/11 attacks, and that the primary goals are to establish democracy and secure access to oil resources.\n\nHowever, the speaker feels that these objectives are not justified, as the war has caused widespread suffering and upset. They mention that staying in Iraq would lead to a lengthy and difficult process of building democracy, which is unlikely to succeed. If the US were to withdraw, Iraqis might be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, potentially leading to further resentment towards the US.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears, suggesting that the war should continue because it wouldn't be fair to pull out now. They argue that the conflict is not a \"war\" in the classical sense, but rather a demonstration of US military power. They also express sympathy for President Bush, who they believe is being unfairly criticized for the war's outcome.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the complexity of the situation, with the speaker acknowledging the importance of considering the human cost of the conflict, particularly for families with loved ones serving in Iraq. However, they also worry that US involvement is exacerbating the situation and creating further divisions within Iraqi society. They fear that attempting to impose American values and democracy on Iraq could ultimately lead to more harm and create an even stronger sense of anti-American sentiment.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the conflict will likely drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly disagree with the idea of making it a law or allowing the state to declare it as legal, as I believe it's a matter that should be left to the discretion of churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which is crucial for maintaining religious tolerance in the United States. Attempting to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing for its illegality are unfairly imposing their own church's beliefs on others, as many Christians and Catholics oppose it. Instead, the government should respect the autonomy of churches to decide what is and isn't acceptable. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for diverse religious practices and beliefs.\n\nMaking an amendment to address this issue would be misguided and contradictory to the constitution's existing principles. Moreover, it would be one of the rare instances where the government would be restricting the people rather than itself. I believe it's not the government's place to intervene in this matter, especially when their motivations seem to be driven by personal biases rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nThe president's push for this amendment appears to be rooted in his personal Catholic beliefs, which would unfairly favor one religion over others. There's no substantial reason to support an amendment that would restrict the freedom of churches, as it wouldn't have a significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society by allowing religious tolerance to flourish.\n\nOverall, I believe the decision should be left to the churches, and the government should refrain from imposing its will on this issue.",
            "The Iraq War was a complex and contentious issue. From the outset, there were concerns that the US government was not entirely transparent about the reasons for the invasion. It seemed that the government attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to manipulate public emotions, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, were against it, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.\n\nIn some ways, the Iraq War resembled the Vietnam War, where the US government attempted to impose a democratic government on a foreign nation. However, history had shown that such efforts often led to a long and challenging process, with significant loss of life and difficulty in establishing stability. The US government seemed unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, including the power vacuum and ensuing chaos.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was seen as a way to establish democracy, similar to the US government's goals in Vietnam. However, the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of winning the hearts and minds of the local population were grossly underestimated. The presence of insurgents and the need to fight against a civilian population made the conflict much harder to win.\n\nThe speaker believes that the US government should not have entered the war without proper planning for various outcomes. The aftermath of the invasion was not given sufficient consideration, and the country is still struggling with instability and violence nearly a decade later. Many American soldiers have lost their lives in the conflict, and the training of Iraqi security forces has been a slow and arduous process.\n\nThe speaker questions the true motives behind the invasion, suggesting that the US government may have been driven by self-interest, particularly the desire to control Iraq's oil resources. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as well as the government's willingness to tolerate similar threats from other nations (such as North Korea), has led to suspicions of deception and a lack of thoroughness in decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the speaker hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict, but is uncertain if this will come to pass.",
            "For me, the issue of gay marriage is quite clear-cut – I've always been in favor of it. I think it's a matter of personal preference, and research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological basis rather than being determined by societal factors. It would be inhumane to deny individuals rights based on something beyond their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government and politics should not interfere with this personal choice.\n\nIn fact, this issue is not even a matter of state or national politics; it's a personal matter that affects individuals and their families. In my own neighborhood, I've seen several openly gay couples who lead their lives just like any other family, contributing to their community in the same way. However, they are unable to get married due to laws that prevent them from doing so. I find it absurd that politicians, like President Bush, attempt to redefine the concept of marriage according to their own interpretations.\n\nRecent studies suggest that homosexuality may be influenced by a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than by upbringing or environmental factors. For instance, a person might be predisposed to being homosexual regardless of whether they have siblings or a father figure. This highlights the biological aspect of sexual orientation, rather than any sociological influence.\n\nFrom my perspective, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a public or federal issue. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention to themselves, but if a gay couple wants to get married, it becomes a national news story. This disparity is unacceptable, and I believe that marriage should be treated as a personal, private matter, rather than a public concern.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public information that anyone can access, including your school. As a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand how this can lead to issues. Posts about violence or threats can lead people to have a negative opinion of you, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they might share your content with others, including school officials.\n\nIn the case that occurred at my school, a student overheard someone mentioning something concerning and reported it to the authorities. When they investigated, they found concerning content on the student's social media profiles that could have been taken as a joke in a different context. This highlights the importance of being mindful of what you share online, as there's no expectation of privacy once it's out there.\n\nIf you don't want people to see something, don't post it online. You can't control what others think or how they react to your content. While I don't think it's right for school officials to be friends with students on social media and monitoring their online activity, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.\n\nIn fact, I think it's a good idea for teachers and RAs to maintain a professional boundary with their students by not creating fake social media accounts or friending them on those platforms. If you're in a position of authority, it's best to avoid being connected to your students' personal lives, as it can create unnecessary complications and responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, the internet is a public forum, and what you post can have real-world consequences. Be careful about what you share online, and be aware of the potential impact it can have on your relationships and reputation.",
            "The conflict has dragged on for an unnecessarily long period. While the initial objective of establishing democracy in another nation was commendable, it appears that this goal has been lost sight of over time. The war seems to have become a means to assert global dominance rather than a genuine attempt to bring about positive change. The motivations behind the war, particularly considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, are also questionable.\n\nIn my opinion, if the primary intention was to introduce democracy to a country with an unfair system, then that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal agendas played a significant role, it would be unfair. It's clear that the war's purpose has been distorted over time, and the conflict has become a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nI believe that the initial stages of the war served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged duration has been excessive. We've been pouring billions of dollars into the conflict, diverting funds away from pressing domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's crucial that we reassess our priorities and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nThe war has already lasted for an extended period, and it's time for the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. We should withdraw our support and redirect the funds to address our own internal problems. The financial burden of this conflict is substantial, and it's essential that we utilize our resources more effectively, focusing on pressing domestic issues rather than propping up a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "The person would like to clarify that they don't think it's an invasion of privacy if someone finds information online. They argue that when you post content on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone, as seen on platforms like Myspace where profiles are only visible to friends. By adding someone as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to view your profile. Therefore, individuals should be aware that a significant number of people may see the information they post online.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes more complex when considering how to balance individual freedom with the potential consequences. While it's not feasible for one person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent harm, it could be seen as unfair to single out certain individuals for scrutiny. The situation also raises questions about the role of social media monitoring in schools and whether it's appropriate for authorities to restrict students' access to platforms like Myspace.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experience with Facebook and concerns about online safety. They mention a disturbing example of someone using a social media platform to gather information about a person and manipulate them into meeting. This highlights the potential risks of sharing personal details online, making it challenging to strike a balance between maintaining online presence and protecting one's anonymity.\n\nThe speaker also brings up a story about their roommate's high school, where students were banned from using Myspace. They question the authority of school officials to restrict students' online activities, suggesting that this may have been an overreach regarding individual privacy. The speaker concludes by expressing uncertainty about the school's right to dictate what online platforms students can use.",
            "Reflecting on the Iraq War, I'm hesitant to share my views due to the common criticism of jumping on the bandwagon of those who opposed it from the start. However, I did express my opposition initially, and it's not a pressing concern anymore now that the general consensus worldwide has solidified that the war was ill-conceived, except within the administration, which struggles to acknowledge their mistakes.\n\nA global survey of public opinion reveals a stark reality: a significant majority, ranging from 75% to 80%, across the world, the US, and Iraq, believe the war was a poor decision. Even US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, think it was a misguided effort and advocate for a speedy withdrawal within a year. This widespread opposition underscores the war's disastrous consequences from the outset, which have continued to escalate since the US involvement.\n\nThe issue boils down to a profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations, which previous administrations have struggled to bridge. The notion that the US can impose democracy on a region that has its own unique values and preferences is misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a malevolent leader, the decision to invade Iraq wasn't taken lightly, and the costs have been devastating.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq remains dire, it's challenging to justify continued US presence. While the administration might propose potential benefits of staying, I haven't been convinced by their arguments. If anything, a gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer wouldn't be unreasonable. In fact, the majority of Iraqis, approximately 80%, believe the US should leave within a year, and a significant segment, at least 25%, advocate for an immediate withdrawal.\n\nConsidering that the very people the US is trying to help are urging them to leave, it's worth taking their opinions seriously. If the US were to ask for their input and they requested withdrawal, it would absolve the US of responsibility if things were to deteriorate further. If the US were to decide to assist Iraq after that, it would at least be seen as a more benevolent action than the current situation. Although, it's unlikely the US will ever be viewed as a benevolent force in the Middle East, this course of action would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While it's true that the United States has made progress in addressing gender discrimination, I still believe it's a significant issue that affects various aspects of society. The problem isn't limited to women, as men also face challenges, particularly in industries where traditional gender roles are prevalent. For instance, in the corporate world, women often struggle to advance to senior positions due to the \"glass ceiling,\" despite their qualifications, because of societal expectations and outdated stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often face criticism and judgment from others, who view it as unusual for men to be primary caregivers. This can be particularly challenging for stay-at-home dads who may have always envisioned themselves in this role. The fashion industry is another area where men are often stereotyped and may not be taken seriously if they're interested in fashion.\n\nHowever, it's heartening to see that there are positive changes taking place. As more women break into leadership positions and become CEOs, they're helping to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes. Moreover, stay-at-home dads are becoming increasingly accepted as primary caregivers, and men in the fashion industry are being taken more seriously. But changing societal attitudes takes time, and it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals in non-traditional roles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other forms of discrimination, such as socioeconomic background and geographical location, can also affect individuals, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area with limited educational opportunities may face prejudice from others in the corporate world, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Ultimately, addressing these complex issues requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the various factors at play and promotes understanding, acceptance, and equality.",
            "It seems that decriminalizing marijuana has reduced its classification from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction similar to a traffic ticket, eliminating the need for arrest and detention. However, this change does not entirely eliminate the potential consequences of being caught, such as affecting job prospects and future opportunities. Although proponents argue that decriminalization can help reduce costs associated with prosecution, law enforcement, and the judicial system, some municipalities may be hesitant to adopt this approach due to philosophical or financial concerns.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there is a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization has led to a significant increase in revenue that can be allocated towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and support for the homeless. On the other hand, some people worry that full legalization could lead to a similar situation as cigarette sales, with marijuana being freely available and potentially contributing to impaired driving and societal disapproval.\n\nIt's worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. However, individuals react differently to substances, and some may be more prone to overindulgence than others. While it's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, it's clear that it can have significant impacts on people's lives, particularly when used excessively. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana use depends on various factors, including the individual's personality and behavior.",
            "I would say that the Catholic Church has a mix of traditional practices and a need to adapt to change. While it's beneficial to draw from its rich history, it's also essential to be flexible and open to new ideas. However, the Church's stance on certain issues seems contradictory. On one hand, it emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching. On the other hand, it often appears to be intolerant of those who don't adhere to its doctrine or come from different faiths.\n\nFor instance, my own family experienced this intolerance firsthand when my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's non-Catholic background. This behavior is hypocritical, as it contradicts the Church's message of acceptance and love.\n\nAdditionally, some Catholic teachings seem to be outdated and don't align with the values they promote. Despite this, the Church continues to stick to these practices. I personally believe that allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, but I'm not convinced that it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilia is a complex issue that likely stems from more than just marital status, and those who would engage in such behavior are unlikely to be deterred by marriage.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that child abuse can happen regardless of whether a priest is married or not. The root of the issue is not the priest's marital status but rather the underlying behavior and circumstances. Therefore, allowing priests to marry is unlikely to be a solution to this problem.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and I don't think I can take a stance on whether one side is right or wrong. This topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage, which can be a sensitive subject. \n\nIt's difficult to approach this without potentially offending someone, and the concept of marriage is quite complex. I'm not convinced that the government should be involved in defining what constitutes a marriage, especially considering it's often considered a sacrament. If two people are married, they should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs, and shouldn't be subject to different tax benefits or government recognition based on their baptism. \n\nIn theory, marriage should be viewed as a civil union between two consenting adults, rather than something that's defined by the government or a specific church. The concept of gay marriage, in this context, is essentially the same as a civil union between two people. \n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it would be logical to push for federal recognition of this. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage. This issue doesn't have the significance or the broad support needed to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a matter of constitutional importance, and the constitution should not be altered to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to some ambivalence towards homosexuality. However, having close friendships with gay individuals has made me more understanding, even if I don't fully agree with their lifestyle choices. While I don't think it should be a national issue, I believe each state should have the autonomy to decide on the legalization of gay marriage, rather than the federal government imposing a single decision. This approach reflects the diverse nature of the United States, where both Democratic and Republican states have varying views on the matter. If someone chooses to live in a state that has legalized gay marriage, they should respect the local decision, as it is a choice they made. In my opinion, homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, and the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. Furthermore, as President Bush's ban on gay marriage is a national decision, it's unreasonable for him to impose his views on every state, considering he doesn't live in every state and will be out of office soon. Ultimately, decisions like this should be left to the states, as they will be directly affected by the outcome, not the president.",
            "I don't think Myspace should be considered a private space, given that it's a public platform. When you post something online, you have to expect that others, including school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. In the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe it's perfectly reasonable for school officials to monitor online activity if it makes the school a safer place.\n\nWhile I understand concerns about privacy, if monitoring online activity leads to the prevention of a school shooting or makes the school a better and safer environment, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, schools often take measures to ensure student safety, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness, which can be related to preventing incidents like school shootings.\n\nIt's true that anything posted online can be accessed and potentially used against someone in the future, but this doesn't necessarily make it an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safe school environment. School officials may monitor online activity to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, but this can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent harm and create a safer school environment.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between monitoring online activity and respecting students' privacy. If school officials have evidence that leads to a specific concern, such as a student engaging in prohibited behavior, it's reasonable for them to investigate further. However, randomly searching through students' online activity without cause can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and monitoring online activity can be a means to achieve this goal. However, it's essential to do so in a manner that respects students' rights to privacy and doesn't unfairly target individuals.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure school environment, not to unfairly target students or invade their privacy.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of the war due to my personal connection to 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation, I believe that the emotional response at the time led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term consequences. As a result, we entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately led to negative outcomes. I now strongly oppose the war and do not think it achieved its intended goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in the affected region are currently preoccupied with internal conflicts and are unable to focus on fighting against external threats. Therefore, our presence in the area is unlikely to have a significant impact on the situation. Unfortunately, my experiences with the aftermath of 9/11 have led me to become desensitized to the situation in the region, and I struggle to muster concern for their plight.\n\nI believe that the concept of war differs significantly between us and the people in the region, with their approach being more brutal and less focused on nation-building. I think they are mainly driven by a desire to expel foreign forces, and I am open to the idea of withdrawing our troops.\n\nIn hindsight, I think our decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. President Bush made a decision to declare war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations at the time, I believe we could have approached the situation with more caution and a clearer plan.\n\nI think it's unlikely that we can fundamentally change the people in the region, as their culture and ways of life are deeply ingrained. Our presence has not brought about significant progress, and I believe it's counterproductive to continue our involvement. In fact, I think it's only a matter of time before the situation collapses once we leave, and we risk harming ourselves by prolonging our stay."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to undergo some changes in certain aspects. The decline in followers is partly due to the Church's inflexibility regarding various issues. For instance, its views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are often perceived as outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern approach, it might be able to retain its followers. \n\nAs it stands, some people are turning away from the Catholic Church because its stance on these issues doesn't align with their own values. For individuals who believe in the right to abortion or support gay marriage, being part of a community where these practices are condemned can be uncomfortable. \n\nThe Church's stance against abortion and its disapproval of gay marriage might drive away those who hold different views. It's also worth considering the Church's stance on female priests and married priests. While some may argue that allowing priests to be married or having female priests could have prevented past issues, it's difficult to say for certain. \n\nThe Catholic Church views its priests as being married to God, dedicating their lives to their faith. However, this is unlike any other profession, where individuals have a life outside of work. It seems unreasonable that priests cannot have a similar balance of work and personal life.",
            "To be honest, I don't have any personal objections to gay marriage. In my opinion, a person's sexual orientation is not something they can choose; it's a natural part of who they are. Therefore, I believe that gay individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems unfair to deny them the right to marry, just as it would be wrong to deny someone the right to marry because of their skin color or any other innate trait.\n\nI think the idea that someone's sexual orientation is a choice is a misconception. Just as we are born with certain physical and emotional characteristics, some people are naturally attracted to the same sex. It's not something they can change or control.\n\nI don't think it's the government's place to dictate who can and cannot get married, especially when it comes to something as personal as sexual orientation. This issue is not about national security, morality, or any other government concern; it's simply about allowing individuals to make their own choices about who they love and want to spend their lives with.\n\nUltimately, gay individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without being judged or punished for their natural orientation. It's essential to respect and accept people for who they are, rather than trying to change or control them.",
            "In my opinion, gay marriage should be legalized without any reservations. The main reason for this is that there is no valid argument against it. Some people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this assumption is misguided. The concept of same-sex relationships and opposite-sex relationships are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. However, both types of relationships share many commonalities and should be treated with the same respect.\n\nOne of the primary concerns surrounding gay marriage is the lack of legal rights for same-sex partners, particularly in situations where one partner requires medical attention. Currently, same-sex partners are not considered family members and are often denied the right to visit their loved ones in hospitals or make important medical decisions. This is unfair, especially considering that many same-sex relationships can be just as fulfilling and enduring as opposite-sex relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as opposite-sex couples. They also face similar challenges and have the same desires for commitment and companionship.\n\nThe main issue at hand is not about religious objections to same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing the rights of same-sex couples in a legal context. Gay couples are not seeking to get married in a church, but rather to obtain a marriage certificate, a legal document issued by the government.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is \"separate but unequal\" is particularly problematic. Denying same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples is discriminatory and unjust. Many people worry about the impact of gay marriage on children and communities, but these concerns are often based on misconceptions and stereotypes.\n\nFor instance, research has shown that children raised by gay parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as children raised by straight parents. Moreover, the main issue with adoption is not the sexual orientation of the adoptive parents, but rather the way society treats children with same-sex parents.\n\nIn some cases, children of gay parents face bullying and prejudice in schools, highlighting the need for greater understanding and acceptance. However, this does not mean that gay parents are inherently flawed or that their children are at risk.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the federal government should take a proactive role in making gay marriage legal across all states. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is morally and ethically flawed, as it ignores the diversity of American culture and values. Rather than imposing a single, narrow perspective on the nation, our government should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for all citizens.\n\nAdditionally, it's essential to recognize that people's views on morality and gay rights vary greatly, and it's not fair to impose one group's beliefs on the rest of society. The American Psychological Association has already debunked the myth that being gay is a result of psychological damage or trauma, and it's time for people to listen to credible research and evidence rather than relying on unverified opinions and cultural norms.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and I've come to realize that the fact a drug is prohibited doesn't necessarily mean it lacks potential benefits. While I believe it shouldn't be accessible to the general public, I think its therapeutic potential should be acknowledged. Many controlled substances used in pharmacies, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets, are also considered illegal but are still utilized due to their benefits. Therefore, I think we should not dismiss the potential advantages of marijuana solely because of the stigma surrounding it. \n\nIt's worth noting that marijuana's potential for abuse is often compared to that of alcohol, which can also lead to negative consequences when misused. However, I don't think they're comparable in this context. Perhaps what we need is a gradual introduction of marijuana's use, allowing people to become more familiar with it and potentially use it responsibly. This would require a shift in public perception and the removal of the negative image associated with marijuana. By doing so, we can encourage its use for medicinal purposes while minimizing the risk of abuse. Many people have a misguided view of marijuana due to its current illicit status, but it's not as detrimental as other substances like heroin or cocaine. By changing this public perception, we can promote responsible use of marijuana for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the changing times of the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. When I was younger, I would regularly attend church on Sundays, dressing up in matching outfits with my friends from a private school. However, the church has since introduced shorter masses, often lasting only 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer when beachwear is common. This shift towards a more relaxed atmosphere has become more noticeable, even in morning masses where I used to dress up. \n\nRegarding the recent scandals surrounding Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these incidents. There are still men who, despite being married or unmarried, have a predilection for children. It's not necessarily the institution of marriage or celibacy that contributes to this issue, but rather the individual's inherent nature. Some other faiths permit married clergy, yet cases of pedophilia still occur, suggesting that personal choices and genetics play a significant role.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientations and tendencies may be determined by genetics, and cannot be changed by external factors, such as upbringings or institutions. This means that the church's rules about marriage and celibacy might not be the primary cause of these issues. If the church was aware of and tried to conceal these incidents, that's a different matter altogether, and they should be held accountable. However, I don't think the church's rules had a significant impact on the prevalence of pedophilia among its clergy.",
            "The speaker initially found the idea acceptable but felt that the timing of the Iraq invasion was problematic, coming as it did shortly after the 9/11 attacks. They believe the Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to invade Iraq, despite the claim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false. This deception, particularly Colin Powell's presentation to the UN, has left a lasting negative impression on the speaker. They view the administration's actions as a disregard for the Constitution and an attempt to marginalize it.\n\nThe speaker also suggests that the Bush administration had a predetermined desire for war, with a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from a perceived slight against his father and a desire to expand the US energy supply. They feel that the war has gone on for too long, but withdrawing now could lead to civil war and more bloodshed.\n\nThe proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations to restore order in Iraq is seen as problematic, as it may infringe upon Iraq's sovereignty and lead to long-term issues with the interim government's effectiveness. The speaker expresses skepticism about the ability of the current Parliament to function and notes the influence of radical elements in the political process, which could lead to further instability.\n\nIn essence, the speaker is critical of the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq war, viewing their actions as a betrayal of the public trust and a disregard for the Constitution. They are uncertain about the best course of action, recognizing that any decision will likely have far-reaching consequences.",
            "The conversation revolves around the speaker's thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, they express confusion about the war, stating that it wasn't formally declared by Congress, which they believe is a requirement for a war to be considered a legitimate one. They also mention that the war was likely a response to the 9/11 attacks, and that the primary goals are to establish democracy and secure access to oil resources.\n\nHowever, the speaker feels that these objectives are not justified, as the war has caused widespread suffering and upset. They mention that staying in Iraq would lead to a lengthy and difficult process of building democracy, which is unlikely to succeed. If the US were to withdraw, Iraqis might be left to pick up the pieces and start anew, potentially leading to further resentment towards the US.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears, suggesting that the war should continue because it wouldn't be fair to pull out now. They argue that the conflict is not a \"war\" in the classical sense, but rather a demonstration of US military power. They also express sympathy for President Bush, who they believe is being unfairly criticized for the war's outcome.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the complexity of the situation, with the speaker acknowledging the importance of considering the human cost of the conflict, particularly for families with loved ones serving in Iraq. However, they also worry that US involvement is exacerbating the situation and creating further divisions within Iraqi society. They fear that attempting to impose American values and democracy on Iraq could ultimately lead to more harm and create an even stronger sense of anti-American sentiment.\n\nUltimately, the speaker concludes that the conflict will likely drag on for years to come, with no clear resolution in sight.",
            "I strongly disagree with the idea of making it a law or allowing the state to declare it as legal, as I believe it's a matter that should be left to the discretion of churches. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which is crucial for maintaining religious tolerance in the United States. Attempting to enforce power over it would be a direct defiance of the constitution.\n\nI think those pushing for its illegality are unfairly imposing their own church's beliefs on others, as many Christians and Catholics oppose it. Instead, the government should respect the autonomy of churches to decide what is and isn't acceptable. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the constitution, allowing for diverse religious practices and beliefs.\n\nMaking an amendment to address this issue would be misguided and contradictory to the constitution's existing principles. Moreover, it would be one of the rare instances where the government would be restricting the people rather than itself. I believe it's not the government's place to intervene in this matter, especially when their motivations seem to be driven by personal biases rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nThe president's push for this amendment appears to be rooted in his personal Catholic beliefs, which would unfairly favor one religion over others. There's no substantial reason to support an amendment that would restrict the freedom of churches, as it wouldn't have a significant impact on the economy or society. In fact, it could potentially have a positive impact on society by allowing religious tolerance to flourish.\n\nOverall, I believe the decision should be left to the churches, and the government should refrain from imposing its will on this issue.",
            "The Iraq War was a complex and contentious issue. From the outset, there were concerns that the US government was not entirely transparent about the reasons for the invasion. It seemed that the government attempted to link the invasion to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to manipulate public emotions, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. The invasion began in 2003, and many people, including the speaker, were against it, especially the idea of a preemptive strike.\n\nIn some ways, the Iraq War resembled the Vietnam War, where the US government attempted to impose a democratic government on a foreign nation. However, history had shown that such efforts often led to a long and challenging process, with significant loss of life and difficulty in establishing stability. The US government seemed unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government, including the power vacuum and ensuing chaos.\n\nThe invasion of Iraq was seen as a way to establish democracy, similar to the US government's goals in Vietnam. However, the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of winning the hearts and minds of the local population were grossly underestimated. The presence of insurgents and the need to fight against a civilian population made the conflict much harder to win.\n\nThe speaker believes that the US government should not have entered the war without proper planning for various outcomes. The aftermath of the invasion was not given sufficient consideration, and the country is still struggling with instability and violence nearly a decade later. Many American soldiers have lost their lives in the conflict, and the training of Iraqi security forces has been a slow and arduous process.\n\nThe speaker questions the true motives behind the invasion, suggesting that the US government may have been driven by self-interest, particularly the desire to control Iraq's oil resources. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as well as the government's willingness to tolerate similar threats from other nations (such as North Korea), has led to suspicions of deception and a lack of thoroughness in decision-making.\n\nUltimately, the speaker hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution to the conflict, but is uncertain if this will come to pass.",
            "For me, the issue of gay marriage is quite clear-cut – I've always been in favor of it. I think it's a matter of personal preference, and research has shown that sexual orientation may have a biological basis rather than being determined by societal factors. It would be inhumane to deny individuals rights based on something beyond their control. As an advocate for gay marriage, I believe that the government and politics should not interfere with this personal choice.\n\nIn fact, this issue is not even a matter of state or national politics; it's a personal matter that affects individuals and their families. In my own neighborhood, I've seen several openly gay couples who lead their lives just like any other family, contributing to their community in the same way. However, they are unable to get married due to laws that prevent them from doing so. I find it absurd that politicians, like President Bush, attempt to redefine the concept of marriage according to their own interpretations.\n\nRecent studies suggest that homosexuality may be influenced by a chemical imbalance in the brain, rather than by upbringing or environmental factors. For instance, a person might be predisposed to being homosexual regardless of whether they have siblings or a father figure. This highlights the biological aspect of sexual orientation, rather than any sociological influence.\n\nFrom my perspective, marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a public or federal issue. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so without drawing attention to themselves, but if a gay couple wants to get married, it becomes a national news story. This disparity is unacceptable, and I believe that marriage should be treated as a personal, private matter, rather than a public concern.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public information that anyone can access, including your school. As a resident assistant, I've seen firsthand how this can lead to issues. Posts about violence or threats can lead people to have a negative opinion of you, and if you're friends with someone on social media, they might share your content with others, including school officials.\n\nIn the case that occurred at my school, a student overheard someone mentioning something concerning and reported it to the authorities. When they investigated, they found concerning content on the student's social media profiles that could have been taken as a joke in a different context. This highlights the importance of being mindful of what you share online, as there's no expectation of privacy once it's out there.\n\nIf you don't want people to see something, don't post it online. You can't control what others think or how they react to your content. While I don't think it's right for school officials to be friends with students on social media and monitoring their online activity, if something concerning is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take it seriously.\n\nIn fact, I think it's a good idea for teachers and RAs to maintain a professional boundary with their students by not creating fake social media accounts or friending them on those platforms. If you're in a position of authority, it's best to avoid being connected to your students' personal lives, as it can create unnecessary complications and responsibilities.\n\nUltimately, the internet is a public forum, and what you post can have real-world consequences. Be careful about what you share online, and be aware of the potential impact it can have on your relationships and reputation.",
            "The conflict has dragged on for an unnecessarily long period. While the initial objective of establishing democracy in another nation was commendable, it appears that this goal has been lost sight of over time. The war seems to have become a means to assert global dominance rather than a genuine attempt to bring about positive change. The motivations behind the war, particularly considering the complicated history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, are also questionable.\n\nIn my opinion, if the primary intention was to introduce democracy to a country with an unfair system, then that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal agendas played a significant role, it would be unfair. It's clear that the war's purpose has been distorted over time, and the conflict has become a self-perpetuating cycle.\n\nI believe that the initial stages of the war served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged duration has been excessive. We've been pouring billions of dollars into the conflict, diverting funds away from pressing domestic issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. It's crucial that we reassess our priorities and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nThe war has already lasted for an extended period, and it's time for the local government to take responsibility for its own affairs. We should withdraw our support and redirect the funds to address our own internal problems. The financial burden of this conflict is substantial, and it's essential that we utilize our resources more effectively, focusing on pressing domestic issues rather than propping up a war that has lost its purpose.",
            "The person would like to clarify that they don't think it's an invasion of privacy if someone finds information online. They argue that when you post content on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone, as seen on platforms like Myspace where profiles are only visible to friends. By adding someone as a friend, you're essentially giving them permission to view your profile. Therefore, individuals should be aware that a significant number of people may see the information they post online.\n\nHowever, the situation becomes more complex when considering how to balance individual freedom with the potential consequences. While it's not feasible for one person to monitor all students' profiles to prevent harm, it could be seen as unfair to single out certain individuals for scrutiny. The situation also raises questions about the role of social media monitoring in schools and whether it's appropriate for authorities to restrict students' access to platforms like Myspace.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experience with Facebook and concerns about online safety. They mention a disturbing example of someone using a social media platform to gather information about a person and manipulate them into meeting. This highlights the potential risks of sharing personal details online, making it challenging to strike a balance between maintaining online presence and protecting one's anonymity.\n\nThe speaker also brings up a story about their roommate's high school, where students were banned from using Myspace. They question the authority of school officials to restrict students' online activities, suggesting that this may have been an overreach regarding individual privacy. The speaker concludes by expressing uncertainty about the school's right to dictate what online platforms students can use.",
            "Reflecting on the Iraq War, I'm hesitant to share my views due to the common criticism of jumping on the bandwagon of those who opposed it from the start. However, I did express my opposition initially, and it's not a pressing concern anymore now that the general consensus worldwide has solidified that the war was ill-conceived, except within the administration, which struggles to acknowledge their mistakes.\n\nA global survey of public opinion reveals a stark reality: a significant majority, ranging from 75% to 80%, across the world, the US, and Iraq, believe the war was a poor decision. Even US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, think it was a misguided effort and advocate for a speedy withdrawal within a year. This widespread opposition underscores the war's disastrous consequences from the outset, which have continued to escalate since the US involvement.\n\nThe issue boils down to a profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations, which previous administrations have struggled to bridge. The notion that the US can impose democracy on a region that has its own unique values and preferences is misguided. While Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a malevolent leader, the decision to invade Iraq wasn't taken lightly, and the costs have been devastating.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq remains dire, it's challenging to justify continued US presence. While the administration might propose potential benefits of staying, I haven't been convinced by their arguments. If anything, a gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer wouldn't be unreasonable. In fact, the majority of Iraqis, approximately 80%, believe the US should leave within a year, and a significant segment, at least 25%, advocate for an immediate withdrawal.\n\nConsidering that the very people the US is trying to help are urging them to leave, it's worth taking their opinions seriously. If the US were to ask for their input and they requested withdrawal, it would absolve the US of responsibility if things were to deteriorate further. If the US were to decide to assist Iraq after that, it would at least be seen as a more benevolent action than the current situation. Although, it's unlikely the US will ever be viewed as a benevolent force in the Middle East, this course of action would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While it's true that the United States has made progress in addressing gender discrimination, I still believe it's a significant issue that affects various aspects of society. The problem isn't limited to women, as men also face challenges, particularly in industries where traditional gender roles are prevalent. For instance, in the corporate world, women often struggle to advance to senior positions due to the \"glass ceiling,\" despite their qualifications, because of societal expectations and outdated stereotypes.\n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often face criticism and judgment from others, who view it as unusual for men to be primary caregivers. This can be particularly challenging for stay-at-home dads who may have always envisioned themselves in this role. The fashion industry is another area where men are often stereotyped and may not be taken seriously if they're interested in fashion.\n\nHowever, it's heartening to see that there are positive changes taking place. As more women break into leadership positions and become CEOs, they're helping to challenge traditional norms and stereotypes. Moreover, stay-at-home dads are becoming increasingly accepted as primary caregivers, and men in the fashion industry are being taken more seriously. But changing societal attitudes takes time, and it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals in non-traditional roles.\n\nIt's also worth noting that other forms of discrimination, such as socioeconomic background and geographical location, can also affect individuals, regardless of their gender. For example, someone from a rural area with limited educational opportunities may face prejudice from others in the corporate world, even if they're highly intelligent and capable. Ultimately, addressing these complex issues requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges the various factors at play and promotes understanding, acceptance, and equality.",
            "It seems that decriminalizing marijuana has reduced its classification from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction similar to a traffic ticket, eliminating the need for arrest and detention. However, this change does not entirely eliminate the potential consequences of being caught, such as affecting job prospects and future opportunities. Although proponents argue that decriminalization can help reduce costs associated with prosecution, law enforcement, and the judicial system, some municipalities may be hesitant to adopt this approach due to philosophical or financial concerns.\n\nIn cities like Denver, where there is a more open-minded attitude towards marijuana, decriminalization has led to a significant increase in revenue that can be allocated towards public education, social programs for the elderly, and support for the homeless. On the other hand, some people worry that full legalization could lead to a similar situation as cigarette sales, with marijuana being freely available and potentially contributing to impaired driving and societal disapproval.\n\nIt's worth noting that both marijuana and alcohol have adverse effects, including impaired motor skills and decision-making abilities. However, individuals react differently to substances, and some may be more prone to overindulgence than others. While it's challenging to generalize the effects of marijuana, it's clear that it can have significant impacts on people's lives, particularly when used excessively. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana use depends on various factors, including the individual's personality and behavior.",
            "I would say that the Catholic Church has a mix of traditional practices and a need to adapt to change. While it's beneficial to draw from its rich history, it's also essential to be flexible and open to new ideas. However, the Church's stance on certain issues seems contradictory. On one hand, it emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, which is a fundamental Catholic teaching. On the other hand, it often appears to be intolerant of those who don't adhere to its doctrine or come from different faiths.\n\nFor instance, my own family experienced this intolerance firsthand when my parents, one Catholic and one Episcopalian, were not allowed to get married in the Catholic Church due to my dad's non-Catholic background. This behavior is hypocritical, as it contradicts the Church's message of acceptance and love.\n\nAdditionally, some Catholic teachings seem to be outdated and don't align with the values they promote. Despite this, the Church continues to stick to these practices. I personally believe that allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, but I'm not convinced that it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. Pedophilia is a complex issue that likely stems from more than just marital status, and those who would engage in such behavior are unlikely to be deterred by marriage.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that child abuse can happen regardless of whether a priest is married or not. The root of the issue is not the priest's marital status but rather the underlying behavior and circumstances. Therefore, allowing priests to marry is unlikely to be a solution to this problem.",
            "I'm still undecided on this issue, and I don't think I can take a stance on whether one side is right or wrong. This topic is particularly challenging because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage, which can be a sensitive subject. \n\nIt's difficult to approach this without potentially offending someone, and the concept of marriage is quite complex. I'm not convinced that the government should be involved in defining what constitutes a marriage, especially considering it's often considered a sacrament. If two people are married, they should be treated equally under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs, and shouldn't be subject to different tax benefits or government recognition based on their baptism. \n\nIn theory, marriage should be viewed as a civil union between two consenting adults, rather than something that's defined by the government or a specific church. The concept of gay marriage, in this context, is essentially the same as a civil union between two people. \n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it would be logical to push for federal recognition of this. However, I strongly disagree with the idea of amending the constitution to ban gay marriage. This issue doesn't have the significance or the broad support needed to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's not a matter of constitutional importance, and the constitution should not be altered to define or ban gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, which has led to some ambivalence towards homosexuality. However, having close friendships with gay individuals has made me more understanding, even if I don't fully agree with their lifestyle choices. While I don't think it should be a national issue, I believe each state should have the autonomy to decide on the legalization of gay marriage, rather than the federal government imposing a single decision. This approach reflects the diverse nature of the United States, where both Democratic and Republican states have varying views on the matter. If someone chooses to live in a state that has legalized gay marriage, they should respect the local decision, as it is a choice they made. In my opinion, homosexuals should have the same rights and opportunities as heterosexuals, and the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. Furthermore, as President Bush's ban on gay marriage is a national decision, it's unreasonable for him to impose his views on every state, considering he doesn't live in every state and will be out of office soon. Ultimately, decisions like this should be left to the states, as they will be directly affected by the outcome, not the president.",
            "I don't think Myspace should be considered a private space, given that it's a public platform. When you post something online, you have to expect that others, including school officials, will be able to see it, whether they're doing it under the school's name or not. In the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe it's perfectly reasonable for school officials to monitor online activity if it makes the school a safer place.\n\nWhile I understand concerns about privacy, if monitoring online activity leads to the prevention of a school shooting or makes the school a better and safer environment, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, schools often take measures to ensure student safety, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness, which can be related to preventing incidents like school shootings.\n\nIt's true that anything posted online can be accessed and potentially used against someone in the future, but this doesn't necessarily make it an invasion of privacy if it's done with the intention of maintaining a safe school environment. School officials may monitor online activity to catch students engaging in prohibited behavior, but this can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent harm and create a safer school environment.\n\nThe key is to strike a balance between monitoring online activity and respecting students' privacy. If school officials have evidence that leads to a specific concern, such as a student engaging in prohibited behavior, it's reasonable for them to investigate further. However, randomly searching through students' online activity without cause can be seen as an invasion of privacy.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students, and monitoring online activity can be a means to achieve this goal. However, it's essential to do so in a manner that respects students' rights to privacy and doesn't unfairly target individuals.\n\nUltimately, the intention behind monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure school environment, not to unfairly target students or invade their privacy.",
            "Initially, I was in favor of the war due to my personal connection to 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation, I believe that the emotional response at the time led to a lack of careful consideration for the long-term consequences. As a result, we entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan, which ultimately led to negative outcomes. I now strongly oppose the war and do not think it achieved its intended goals.\n\nIn my opinion, the people in the affected region are currently preoccupied with internal conflicts and are unable to focus on fighting against external threats. Therefore, our presence in the area is unlikely to have a significant impact on the situation. Unfortunately, my experiences with the aftermath of 9/11 have led me to become desensitized to the situation in the region, and I struggle to muster concern for their plight.\n\nI believe that the concept of war differs significantly between us and the people in the region, with their approach being more brutal and less focused on nation-building. I think they are mainly driven by a desire to expel foreign forces, and I am open to the idea of withdrawing our troops.\n\nIn hindsight, I think our decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. President Bush made a decision to declare war on Iraq, and while I understand his motivations at the time, I believe we could have approached the situation with more caution and a clearer plan.\n\nI think it's unlikely that we can fundamentally change the people in the region, as their culture and ways of life are deeply ingrained. Our presence has not brought about significant progress, and I believe it's counterproductive to continue our involvement. In fact, I think it's only a matter of time before the situation collapses once we leave, and we risk harming ourselves by prolonging our stay."
