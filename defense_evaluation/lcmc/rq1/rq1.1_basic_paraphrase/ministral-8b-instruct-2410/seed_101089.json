            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from certain changes in its views. There has been discussion about the Church losing some of its followers, which I attribute to its stance on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While the Church has strong views on these topics, they can sometimes be considered outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might be able to retain its following. Some people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to disagreements over its stances on these issues. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might not feel comfortable in a community that considers these practices wrong. While I don't see any reason why women couldn't be priests or priests couldn't be married, I'm not certain if these changes would have prevented the Church's current challenges.",
            "In my opinion, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I don't think it's something that's chosen; it's more of an inherent part of who someone is. Therefore, I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can get married but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. I don't think it's a choice, like being straight is not a choice either. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue or a moral concern. It's just how people are born, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There's no compelling reason to prevent it. Many opponents claim that gay couples threaten the traditional heterosexual family, but these relationships are unique and multifaceted, and cannot be equated to heterosexual ones. They are essentially two sides of the same coin, with the same rights and responsibilities. For instance, without legal recognition, a gay partner can't visit or be present when their partner is ill, or make decisions about their partner's healthcare. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe core issue here is that same-sex couples are not seeking religious marriage ceremonies, but simply legal marriage certificates. If civil unions are allowed, why not marriage? It's like having separate but unequal laws; it's not logical to deny one group the same rights and benefits. People also often worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Parenting skills are the same regardless of sexual orientation. Children of gay couples can and do thrive in their communities just like children of straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in all states. I think the current amendment should be reversed. However, President Bush's stance on this issue is strongly influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against gay marriage are rooted in morality, which is subjective and varies among individuals. It's hypocritical for the government to support certain religious beliefs while ignoring others, especially considering recent controversies around religious influence in political decisions.\n\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or trauma, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. Ignoring the findings of reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association and instead relying on personal beliefs and popular opinions can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. To clarify, the legality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for general public access, I believe it can have medicinal uses. Illegal doesn't mean beneficial; it simply isn't beneficial. Additionally, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in hospitals because they provide benefits when used appropriately. I don't see a significant difference between marijuana and these drugs, and I think we should consider its potential benefits. I suggest legalizing it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. People's negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. Once we remove this stigma, people can potentially use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. However, I don't see the need to compare it to heroin or cocaine, as they are entirely different substances.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's less strict now compared to how it used to be. When I was younger, I would go to church every Sunday and always wear cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. Now, they have a teen mass that only lasts 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Even in the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. The church I know has seen the biggest changes in that aspect. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's the main thing I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe some people are inherently attracted to children, regardless of their marital status. The church can't change that. It's more about the individual person's genetics and upbringing. If they knowingly covered up cases, they're at fault, but not all cases were known. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but I believe that the September 11th attacks were still fresh in everyone's minds, which may have led to the decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. This bothers me greatly and the Iraq war really agitates me.\n\nI feel that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced at the time. This, to me, constitutes a dereliction of duty and should be grounds for impeachment. I think the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution and has tried to undermine it since 9/11. The administration entered office with a goal to go to war.\n\nThere have been allegations that George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and there may have been a desire to increase our energy supply, which is a rather underhanded motivation.\n\nI believe the war has gone on too long, but I'm concerned that pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The UN and the US are now considering a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. It could cause long-term problems, as Iraq's sovereignty is already an issue, and the interim government seems ineffective. News reports suggest the Parliament is not functioning well, and the Prime Minister lacks control. The political process is fraught with friction due to radical elements vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds a significant number of seats in the Parliament.",
            "I expressed some thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, I felt it was pointless because it wasn't a declared war, and it seemed like a revenge mission against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not well-informed about the war, but I believe our presence there is to build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's justified to stay, as it's causing unrest and may lead to long-term issues. The creation of democracy can't happen overnight, and leaving would result in anger and having to start over. It's a challenging topic for me, as I don't know much about it. I think the war should continue, but it's hard to call it a war as it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I feel Bush's actions are making him look bad. I believe the war could be seen as a meaningless conflict, much like the Vietnam War. It's difficult to say if I want the war to continue, as there are families with relatives serving in Iraq, but staying may cause more harm in the long run. The culture clash could lead to increased hatred towards the U.S. and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda. I think this war will continue for many years. That's about it.",
            "I genuinely don't feel that it's appropriate for a state to legalize or outlaw it. I believe this decision should be left to the churches, as the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state clearly states. Attempting to impose any authority on this matter would be a defiance of the Constitution. I think those advocating for its illegality are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it’s the government's place to decide what the churches can and cannot legalize. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution and promotes religious tolerance. I don't think an amendment on this matter is necessary or right, as it would go against what's already established in the Constitution and could potentially restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be solely based on his personal Catholic beliefs, demonstrating a preference for one religion over others. Therefore, I believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the government. There doesn't seem to be any substantial reason for an amendment banning it, and it could even have a positive impact on society.",
            "I believe the government was not entirely honest with Americans about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. The invasion was made to appear connected to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but that wasn't the case. The government exploited the public's outrage to gain support for the war. I was against the war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq mirrors many aspects of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from the mistakes made there. The loss of American lives was immense, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. The US removed the Iraqi government and attempted to establish a democratic one, similar to what was done in Vietnam. However, the process was long and difficult, and the government underestimated the challenges. I feel the US government misled the American people into believing the war would be short and successful. Democracy takes time to establish and stabilize, as it did in the US itself. I also question why Iraq was the only country targeted for democracy when other countries with similar issues were not. The main reason seems to be access to oil. The claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was not supported by evidence, while countries like North Korea, which do have such weapons, were not targeted. I hope the war ends soon, but I expect it will not.",
            "I am in favor of same-sex marriage. I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice and that it's increasingly being recognized as a biological inclination rather than a societal influence. Taking away rights due to something that's out of one's control is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should be involved in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples who function just like any other family. I think it's absurd for Bush to try and dictate marriage based on his personal interpretations. I've read that being gay might be influenced by biological factors rather than societal ones. Additionally, same-sex couples shouldn't face the same level of scrutiny and public attention as opposite-sex couples. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public and accessible to anyone. As an example, I, as a teacher, have dealt with this issue before. When you put information out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you discuss topics like violence or harmful actions, someone might interpret your posts in a serious way. The internet is seen by everyone, including friends on social platforms like Myspace. If something is posted, it can reach the school, which then has to act upon it to ensure safety. However, you can't always know what to take seriously, as some people might post things as jokes. For instance, a student might have written something about a sociology experiment gone wrong, which could also be interpreted as a serious threat. When you post something online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret your posts. While school officials shouldn't friend students on social media, if a threat is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't monitor private communications, but if something is reported, they have to act. Similarly, I wouldn't friend my students on social media to avoid seeing inappropriate content.",
            "The conflict appears to have lasted much longer than necessary. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, it seems that we've strayed from that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're continuing the war for the sake of proving our power, rather than for any genuine reason.\n\nThe initial push had a clear message, but the prolonged duration is now excessive. The war has been going on for over a year, possibly even years. While the intention to bring democracy to a tyrannized country was valid, I believe our cause has been diluted and misguided. It seems we're now engaged in a war for the sake of waging war, rather than achieving a clear goal.\n\nWe've stretched our resources thin, spending billions of dollars on this conflict. We have our own domestic issues to address, such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These are areas where our money could be much better spent.

You might need to\nKnow, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it.\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good,\nThat someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost,\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough,\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that,\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think,\nO let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\nUm\nI mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles,\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles\nAnd just happened to see that,\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know,\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\nSo, I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell,\nLike,\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook,\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me,\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\nUm,\nThis man who just,\nHe was just trying to prove how easy it is to get information,\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away,\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger,\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him,\nAnd I mean,\nPersonally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone,\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me,\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests,\nThey know what you look like,\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\nWho your friends are,\nThey pretty much know a lot about you,\nAll sorts of photos,\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there,\nBut at the same time,\nThe whole point\nI think,\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends,\nI don't want to limit it too much,\nSo it's a tricky issue,\nBecause I only accept people I know,\nI mean you never know really,\nWho can look at what,\nSo\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school,\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school,\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange,\nLike I wasn't sure how,\nHow high school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue,\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe're only going to discuss the Iraq War one more time\nUm\nI feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to seem like one of those people who say they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not really relevant anymore\nBecause most people everywhere agree it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nUm\nLook at recent polls\nThey've done polls in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year\nUm\nIt's been a disaster from the start\nIt was bad before we got there and pulling out now will be bad too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East these days\nUm\nI think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too wide for any administration to understand and they want to impose democracy in an area where it doesn't fit\nUm\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but you have to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nJust like quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nThe administration might have hopeful reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any legitimate ones\nUm\nIf they want to stay gradually over a year or more, I guess I wouldn't mind\nBut I don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now\nUm\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately\nThese are the people we're supposed to be helping\nThey're telling us to leave\nUm\nMaybe they know best\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help afterward, at least we'll be the good guys, sort of\nI mean, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, indeed, I believe that gender discrimination is still prevalent in the United States. It's not just women, though; discrimination can also occur within specific job fields. For example, women face the \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite their qualifications, they may not be promoted to higher positions because it's not customary for women to hold such roles. Similarly, men who stay at home to care for their children face societal disapproval, as society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they're straight, as they are perceived as not understanding women's fashion. I feel that gender discrimination exists across various industries and locations. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's crucial to continue promoting the qualities of those stereotyped against without being too forceful. In the meantime, we must recognize that people from different backgrounds can also face discrimination, whether due to their gender, job type, or where they grew from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This change reduced marijuana possession from a criminal offense to a minor infraction similar to getting a traffic ticket, where you receive a citation rather than experiencing arrest and other legal processes. When someone is cited for possessing marijuana, it can still negatively impact job prospects and other life aspects, as is the case with drug charges. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on law enforcement and the legal system, potentially saving money. However, some communities may be financially strained and philosophically opposed to decriminalizing marijuana. In places like Denver, with a more open and liberal mindset, decriminalization may be seen as a viable option to redirect resources into education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be widely available in public spaces, its legalization could lead to it being sold openly, like cigarettes, which could cause issues with public smoking and driving under the influence. Alcohol and marijuana both have adverse effects on individuals, but reactions vary greatly, and moderation is key.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause while many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition and it's good to maintain those roots, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. I believe that a lot of Catholics are very strict about following the weekly church attendance and doctrine, which can make those who don't adhere to these rules feel judged or unwelcome. For instance, my parents had different religious beliefs – my mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian – and they were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church due to my father's religion. This lack of tolerance for other religions feels hypocritical considering the Catholic teaching to love others. I feel that the Catholic Church often practices traditions that contradict their teachings due to their outdated nature. I don't believe that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent child molestation, as the issue is more about personal character than marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue. I can't definitively say whether one side is right or wrong because it's such a contentious topic. It's particularly tricky due to the sensitive balance between church and state and how to legally define marriage. I believe all civil unions should be treated the same, regardless of religious or personal beliefs. If a couple is married, I think the government should treat it as a civil union, rather than inquire about its religious significance. As for gay marriage, I think each state should come to a rational decision and push for nationwide recognition. However, amending the constitution to ban it is unreasonable; it's not a pressing enough issue to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian family, so my stance on homosexuality is somewhat complex. I have many gay friends, and while I don't entirely support the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue but rather something that should be decided individually by each state. Many states are democratic and will likely push for gay marriage, and it's important to respect their decisions since people choose to live there. I don't believe the president should impose their views on every state. I think the decision should be left up to individual states, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "I wouldn't say no, in fact. If you consider what Myspace is, it's essentially a platform where you can post things for the public to see. When you post something online, you have to be aware that many people, including school officials, might see it. Therefore, if school officials see it, they have the right to do so, especially if it's to prevent something like a school shooting. Even though they might be checking for things like students drinking or smoking, it's understandable if it helps to make the school safer. It's a public thing, and students should be aware of that. I'm not saying they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it leads them to make the school safer, then I think it's fine. Similarly, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy if it helps the school officials in their duty to keep students safe. I've discussed this with a teacher, and it's important for schools to ensure safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. So, while I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I do understand the concern about privacy. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Initially, I supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. However, I now believe that our response was driven primarily by emotion and a lack of long-term planning. We invaded Iraq unprepared and without a clear strategy. In retrospect, I think the war was a mistake. I'm now strongly against it. I don't believe our presence has done anything to deter further attacks. In fact, I think the internal conflicts in the region are preventing any real progress. I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel that they are capable of fighting each other but not with us. I believe we should have a better plan before entering a conflict. We were more focused on revenge than rational thinking. President Bush, driven by public opinion, declared war on Iraq, which I understand, but I think we could have handled it differently. The lack of unity and clear objectives in our mission hurt our cause. I don't believe we can or should try to change their culture. I think they'll continue to be the same. I don't see enough progress to justify our continued presence, and I believe their situation will deteriorate once we leave. We're only harming ourselves by staying there."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from certain changes in its views. There has been discussion about the Church losing some of its followers, which I attribute to its stance on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While the Church has strong views on these topics, they can sometimes be considered outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might be able to retain its following. Some people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to disagreements over its stances on these issues. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might not feel comfortable in a community that considers these practices wrong. While I don't see any reason why women couldn't be priests or priests couldn't be married, I'm not certain if these changes would have prevented the Church's current challenges.",
            "In my opinion, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I don't think it's something that's chosen; it's more of an inherent part of who someone is. Therefore, I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can get married but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. I don't think it's a choice, like being straight is not a choice either. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue or a moral concern. It's just how people are born, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There's no compelling reason to prevent it. Many opponents claim that gay couples threaten the traditional heterosexual family, but these relationships are unique and multifaceted, and cannot be equated to heterosexual ones. They are essentially two sides of the same coin, with the same rights and responsibilities. For instance, without legal recognition, a gay partner can't visit or be present when their partner is ill, or make decisions about their partner's healthcare. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe core issue here is that same-sex couples are not seeking religious marriage ceremonies, but simply legal marriage certificates. If civil unions are allowed, why not marriage? It's like having separate but unequal laws; it's not logical to deny one group the same rights and benefits. People also often worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Parenting skills are the same regardless of sexual orientation. Children of gay couples can and do thrive in their communities just like children of straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in all states. I think the current amendment should be reversed. However, President Bush's stance on this issue is strongly influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against gay marriage are rooted in morality, which is subjective and varies among individuals. It's hypocritical for the government to support certain religious beliefs while ignoring others, especially considering recent controversies around religious influence in political decisions.\n\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or trauma, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. Ignoring the findings of reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association and instead relying on personal beliefs and popular opinions can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. To clarify, the legality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for general public access, I believe it can have medicinal uses. Illegal doesn't mean beneficial; it simply isn't beneficial. Additionally, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in hospitals because they provide benefits when used appropriately. I don't see a significant difference between marijuana and these drugs, and I think we should consider its potential benefits. I suggest legalizing it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. People's negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. Once we remove this stigma, people can potentially use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. However, I don't see the need to compare it to heroin or cocaine, as they are entirely different substances.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's less strict now compared to how it used to be. When I was younger, I would go to church every Sunday and always wear cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. Now, they have a teen mass that only lasts 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Even in the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. The church I know has seen the biggest changes in that aspect. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's the main thing I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe some people are inherently attracted to children, regardless of their marital status. The church can't change that. It's more about the individual person's genetics and upbringing. If they knowingly covered up cases, they're at fault, but not all cases were known. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but I believe that the September 11th attacks were still fresh in everyone's minds, which may have led to the decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. This bothers me greatly and the Iraq war really agitates me.\n\nI feel that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced at the time. This, to me, constitutes a dereliction of duty and should be grounds for impeachment. I think the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution and has tried to undermine it since 9/11. The administration entered office with a goal to go to war.\n\nThere have been allegations that George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and there may have been a desire to increase our energy supply, which is a rather underhanded motivation.\n\nI believe the war has gone on too long, but I'm concerned that pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The UN and the US are now considering a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. It could cause long-term problems, as Iraq's sovereignty is already an issue, and the interim government seems ineffective. News reports suggest the Parliament is not functioning well, and the Prime Minister lacks control. The political process is fraught with friction due to radical elements vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds a significant number of seats in the Parliament.",
            "I expressed some thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, I felt it was pointless because it wasn't a declared war, and it seemed like a revenge mission against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not well-informed about the war, but I believe our presence there is to build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's justified to stay, as it's causing unrest and may lead to long-term issues. The creation of democracy can't happen overnight, and leaving would result in anger and having to start over. It's a challenging topic for me, as I don't know much about it. I think the war should continue, but it's hard to call it a war as it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I feel Bush's actions are making him look bad. I believe the war could be seen as a meaningless conflict, much like the Vietnam War. It's difficult to say if I want the war to continue, as there are families with relatives serving in Iraq, but staying may cause more harm in the long run. The culture clash could lead to increased hatred towards the U.S. and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda. I think this war will continue for many years. That's about it.",
            "I genuinely don't feel that it's appropriate for a state to legalize or outlaw it. I believe this decision should be left to the churches, as the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state clearly states. Attempting to impose any authority on this matter would be a defiance of the Constitution. I think those advocating for its illegality are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it’s the government's place to decide what the churches can and cannot legalize. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution and promotes religious tolerance. I don't think an amendment on this matter is necessary or right, as it would go against what's already established in the Constitution and could potentially restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be solely based on his personal Catholic beliefs, demonstrating a preference for one religion over others. Therefore, I believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the government. There doesn't seem to be any substantial reason for an amendment banning it, and it could even have a positive impact on society.",
            "I believe the government was not entirely honest with Americans about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. The invasion was made to appear connected to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but that wasn't the case. The government exploited the public's outrage to gain support for the war. I was against the war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq mirrors many aspects of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from the mistakes made there. The loss of American lives was immense, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. The US removed the Iraqi government and attempted to establish a democratic one, similar to what was done in Vietnam. However, the process was long and difficult, and the government underestimated the challenges. I feel the US government misled the American people into believing the war would be short and successful. Democracy takes time to establish and stabilize, as it did in the US itself. I also question why Iraq was the only country targeted for democracy when other countries with similar issues were not. The main reason seems to be access to oil. The claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was not supported by evidence, while countries like North Korea, which do have such weapons, were not targeted. I hope the war ends soon, but I expect it will not.",
            "I am in favor of same-sex marriage. I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice and that it's increasingly being recognized as a biological inclination rather than a societal influence. Taking away rights due to something that's out of one's control is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should be involved in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples who function just like any other family. I think it's absurd for Bush to try and dictate marriage based on his personal interpretations. I've read that being gay might be influenced by biological factors rather than societal ones. Additionally, same-sex couples shouldn't face the same level of scrutiny and public attention as opposite-sex couples. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public and accessible to anyone. As an example, I, as a teacher, have dealt with this issue before. When you put information out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you discuss topics like violence or harmful actions, someone might interpret your posts in a serious way. The internet is seen by everyone, including friends on social platforms like Myspace. If something is posted, it can reach the school, which then has to act upon it to ensure safety. However, you can't always know what to take seriously, as some people might post things as jokes. For instance, a student might have written something about a sociology experiment gone wrong, which could also be interpreted as a serious threat. When you post something online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret your posts. While school officials shouldn't friend students on social media, if a threat is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't monitor private communications, but if something is reported, they have to act. Similarly, I wouldn't friend my students on social media to avoid seeing inappropriate content.",
            "The conflict appears to have lasted much longer than necessary. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, it seems that we've strayed from that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're continuing the war for the sake of proving our power, rather than for any genuine reason.\n\nThe initial push had a clear message, but the prolonged duration is now excessive. The war has been going on for over a year, possibly even years. While the intention to bring democracy to a tyrannized country was valid, I believe our cause has been diluted and misguided. It seems we're now engaged in a war for the sake of waging war, rather than achieving a clear goal.\n\nWe've stretched our resources thin, spending billions of dollars on this conflict. We have our own domestic issues to address, such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These are areas where our money could be much better spent. Instead, we're draining our economy while also putting our citizens' lives at risk in a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to ask a question to clarify:\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and discovered that there was like\n\nOkay\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand on Myspace, you need to have someone else be your friend to see their profile. You might need to\nKnow, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it.\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good,\nThat someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost,\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough,\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that,\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think,\nO let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\nUm\nI mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles,\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles\nAnd just happened to see that,\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know,\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\nSo, I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell,\nLike,\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook,\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me,\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\nUm,\nThis man who just,\nHe was just trying to prove how easy it is to get information,\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away,\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger,\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him,\nAnd I mean,\nPersonally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone,\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me,\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests,\nThey know what you look like,\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\nWho your friends are,\nThey pretty much know a lot about you,\nAll sorts of photos,\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there,\nBut at the same time,\nThe whole point\nI think,\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends,\nI don't want to limit it too much,\nSo it's a tricky issue,\nBecause I only accept people I know,\nI mean you never know really,\nWho can look at what,\nSo\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school,\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school,\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange,\nLike I wasn't sure how,\nHow high school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue,\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",

            "Yes, indeed, I believe that gender discrimination is still prevalent in the United States. It's not just women, though; discrimination can also occur within specific job fields. For example, women face the \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite their qualifications, they may not be promoted to higher positions because it's not customary for women to hold such roles. Similarly, men who stay at home to care for their children face societal disapproval, as society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they're straight, as they are perceived as not understanding women's fashion. I feel that gender discrimination exists across various industries and locations. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's crucial to continue promoting the qualities of those stereotyped against without being too forceful. In the meantime, we must recognize that people from different backgrounds can also face discrimination, whether due to their gender, job type, or where they grew from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This change reduced marijuana possession from a criminal offense to a minor infraction similar to getting a traffic ticket, where you receive a citation rather than experiencing arrest and other legal processes. When someone is cited for possessing marijuana, it can still negatively impact job prospects and other life aspects, as is the case with drug charges. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on law enforcement and the legal system, potentially saving money. However, some communities may be financially strained and philosophically opposed to decriminalizing marijuana. In places like Denver, with a more open and liberal mindset, decriminalization may be seen as a viable option to redirect resources into education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be widely available in public spaces, its legalization could lead to it being sold openly, like cigarettes, which could cause issues with public smoking and driving under the influence. Alcohol and marijuana both have adverse effects on individuals, but reactions vary greatly, and moderation is key.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause while many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition and it's good to maintain those roots, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. I believe that a lot of Catholics are very strict about following the weekly church attendance and doctrine, which can make those who don't adhere to these rules feel judged or unwelcome. For instance, my parents had different religious beliefs – my mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian – and they were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church due to my father's religion. This lack of tolerance for other religions feels hypocritical considering the Catholic teaching to love others. I feel that the Catholic Church often practices traditions that contradict their teachings due to their outdated nature. I don't believe that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent child molestation, as the issue is more about personal character than marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue. I can't definitively say whether one side is right or wrong because it's such a contentious topic. It's particularly tricky due to the sensitive balance between church and state and how to legally define marriage. I believe all civil unions should be treated the same, regardless of religious or personal beliefs. If a couple is married, I think the government should treat it as a civil union, rather than inquire about its religious significance. As for gay marriage, I think each state should come to a rational decision and push for nationwide recognition. However, amending the constitution to ban it is unreasonable; it's not a pressing enough issue to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian family, so my stance on homosexuality is somewhat complex. I have many gay friends, and while I don't entirely support the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue but rather something that should be decided individually by each state. Many states are democratic and will likely push for gay marriage, and it's important to respect their decisions since people choose to live there. I don't believe the president should impose their views on every state. I think the decision should be left up to individual states, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "I wouldn't say no, in fact. If you consider what Myspace is, it's essentially a platform where you can post things for the public to see. When you post something online, you have to be aware that many people, including school officials, might see it. Therefore, if school officials see it, they have the right to do so, especially if it's to prevent something like a school shooting. Even though they might be checking for things like students drinking or smoking, it's understandable if it helps to make the school safer. It's a public thing, and students should be aware of that. I'm not saying they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it leads them to make the school safer, then I think it's fine. Similarly, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy if it helps the school officials in their duty to keep students safe. I've discussed this with a teacher, and it's important for schools to ensure safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. So, while I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I do understand the concern about privacy. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Initially, I supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. However, I now believe that our response was driven primarily by emotion and a lack of long-term planning. We invaded Iraq unprepared and without a clear strategy. In retrospect, I think the war was a mistake. I'm now strongly against it. I don't believe our presence has done anything to deter further attacks. In fact, I think the internal conflicts in the region are preventing any real progress. I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel that they are capable of fighting each other but not with us. I believe we should have a better plan before entering a conflict. We were more focused on revenge than rational thinking. President Bush, driven by public opinion, declared war on Iraq, which I understand, but I think we could have handled it differently. The lack of unity and clear objectives in our mission hurt our cause. I don't believe we can or should try to change their culture. I think they'll continue to be the same. I don't see enough progress to justify our continued presence, and I believe their situation will deteriorate once we leave. We're only harming ourselves by staying there."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from certain changes in its views. There has been discussion about the Church losing some of its followers, which I attribute to its stance on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While the Church has strong views on these topics, they can sometimes be considered outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might be able to retain its following. Some people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to disagreements over its stances on these issues. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might not feel comfortable in a community that considers these practices wrong. While I don't see any reason why women couldn't be priests or priests couldn't be married, I'm not certain if these changes would have prevented the Church's current challenges.",
            "In my opinion, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I don't think it's something that's chosen; it's more of an inherent part of who someone is. Therefore, I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can get married but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. I don't think it's a choice, like being straight is not a choice either. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue or a moral concern. It's just how people are born, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There's no compelling reason to prevent it. Many opponents claim that gay couples threaten the traditional heterosexual family, but these relationships are unique and multifaceted, and cannot be equated to heterosexual ones. They are essentially two sides of the same coin, with the same rights and responsibilities. For instance, without legal recognition, a gay partner can't visit or be present when their partner is ill, or make decisions about their partner's healthcare. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe core issue here is that same-sex couples are not seeking religious marriage ceremonies, but simply legal marriage certificates. If civil unions are allowed, why not marriage? It's like having separate but unequal laws; it's not logical to deny one group the same rights and benefits. People also often worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Parenting skills are the same regardless of sexual orientation. Children of gay couples can and do thrive in their communities just like children of straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in all states. I think the current amendment should be reversed. However, President Bush's stance on this issue is strongly influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against gay marriage are rooted in morality, which is subjective and varies among individuals. It's hypocritical for the government to support certain religious beliefs while ignoring others, especially considering recent controversies around religious influence in political decisions.\n\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or trauma, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. Ignoring the findings of reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association and instead relying on personal beliefs and popular opinions can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. To clarify, the legality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for general public access, I believe it can have medicinal uses. Illegal doesn't mean beneficial; it simply isn't beneficial. Additionally, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in hospitals because they provide benefits when used appropriately. I don't see a significant difference between marijuana and these drugs, and I think we should consider its potential benefits. I suggest legalizing it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. People's negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. Once we remove this stigma, people can potentially use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. However, I don't see the need to compare it to heroin or cocaine, as they are entirely different substances.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's less strict now compared to how it used to be. When I was younger, I would go to church every Sunday and always wear cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. Now, they have a teen mass that only lasts 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Even in the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. The church I know has seen the biggest changes in that aspect. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's the main thing I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe some people are inherently attracted to children, regardless of their marital status. The church can't change that. It's more about the individual person's genetics and upbringing. If they knowingly covered up cases, they're at fault, but not all cases were known. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but I believe that the September 11th attacks were still fresh in everyone's minds, which may have led to the decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. This bothers me greatly and the Iraq war really agitates me.\n\nI feel that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced at the time. This, to me, constitutes a dereliction of duty and should be grounds for impeachment. I think the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution and has tried to undermine it since 9/11. The administration entered office with a goal to go to war.\n\nThere have been allegations that George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and there may have been a desire to increase our energy supply, which is a rather underhanded motivation.\n\nI believe the war has gone on too long, but I'm concerned that pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The UN and the US are now considering a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. It could cause long-term problems, as Iraq's sovereignty is already an issue, and the interim government seems ineffective. News reports suggest the Parliament is not functioning well, and the Prime Minister lacks control. The political process is fraught with friction due to radical elements vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds a significant number of seats in the Parliament.",
            "I expressed some thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, I felt it was pointless because it wasn't a declared war, and it seemed like a revenge mission against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not well-informed about the war, but I believe our presence there is to build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's justified to stay, as it's causing unrest and may lead to long-term issues. The creation of democracy can't happen overnight, and leaving would result in anger and having to start over. It's a challenging topic for me, as I don't know much about it. I think the war should continue, but it's hard to call it a war as it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I feel Bush's actions are making him look bad. I believe the war could be seen as a meaningless conflict, much like the Vietnam War. It's difficult to say if I want the war to continue, as there are families with relatives serving in Iraq, but staying may cause more harm in the long run. The culture clash could lead to increased hatred towards the U.S. and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda. I think this war will continue for many years. That's about it.",
            "I genuinely don't feel that it's appropriate for a state to legalize or outlaw it. I believe this decision should be left to the churches, as the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state clearly states. Attempting to impose any authority on this matter would be a defiance of the Constitution. I think those advocating for its illegality are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it’s the government's place to decide what the churches can and cannot legalize. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution and promotes religious tolerance. I don't think an amendment on this matter is necessary or right, as it would go against what's already established in the Constitution and could potentially restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be solely based on his personal Catholic beliefs, demonstrating a preference for one religion over others. Therefore, I believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the government. There doesn't seem to be any substantial reason for an amendment banning it, and it could even have a positive impact on society.",
            "I believe the government was not entirely honest with Americans about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. The invasion was made to appear connected to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but that wasn't the case. The government exploited the public's outrage to gain support for the war. I was against the war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq mirrors many aspects of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from the mistakes made there. The loss of American lives was immense, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. The US removed the Iraqi government and attempted to establish a democratic one, similar to what was done in Vietnam. However, the process was long and difficult, and the government underestimated the challenges. I feel the US government misled the American people into believing the war would be short and successful. Democracy takes time to establish and stabilize, as it did in the US itself. I also question why Iraq was the only country targeted for democracy when other countries with similar issues were not. The main reason seems to be access to oil. The claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was not supported by evidence, while countries like North Korea, which do have such weapons, were not targeted. I hope the war ends soon, but I expect it will not.",
            "I am in favor of same-sex marriage. I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice and that it's increasingly being recognized as a biological inclination rather than a societal influence. Taking away rights due to something that's out of one's control is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should be involved in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples who function just like any other family. I think it's absurd for Bush to try and dictate marriage based on his personal interpretations. I've read that being gay might be influenced by biological factors rather than societal ones. Additionally, same-sex couples shouldn't face the same level of scrutiny and public attention as opposite-sex couples. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public and accessible to anyone. As an example, I, as a teacher, have dealt with this issue before. When you put information out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you discuss topics like violence or harmful actions, someone might interpret your posts in a serious way. The internet is seen by everyone, including friends on social platforms like Myspace. If something is posted, it can reach the school, which then has to act upon it to ensure safety. However, you can't always know what to take seriously, as some people might post things as jokes. For instance, a student might have written something about a sociology experiment gone wrong, which could also be interpreted as a serious threat. When you post something online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret your posts. While school officials shouldn't friend students on social media, if a threat is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't monitor private communications, but if something is reported, they have to act. Similarly, I wouldn't friend my students on social media to avoid seeing inappropriate content.",
            "The conflict appears to have lasted much longer than necessary. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, it seems that we've strayed from that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're continuing the war for the sake of proving our power, rather than for any genuine reason.\n\nThe initial push had a clear message, but the prolonged duration is now excessive. The war has been going on for over a year, possibly even years. While the intention to bring democracy to a tyrannized country was valid, I believe our cause has been diluted and misguided. It seems we're now engaged in a war for the sake of waging war, rather than achieving a clear goal.\n\nWe've stretched our resources thin, spending billions of dollars on this conflict. We have our own domestic issues to address, such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These are areas where our money could be much better spent. Instead, we're draining our economy while also putting our citizens' lives at risk in a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to ask a question to clarify:\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and discovered that there was like\n\nOkay\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand on Myspace, you need to have someone else be your friend to see their profile. You might need to\nKnow, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it.\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good,\nThat someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost,\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough,\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that,\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think,\nO let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\nUm\nI mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles,\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles\nAnd just happened to see that,\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know,\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\nSo, I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell,\nLike,\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook,\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me,\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\nUm,\nThis man who just,\nHe was just trying to prove how easy it is to get information,\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away,\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger,\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him,\nAnd I mean,\nPersonally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone,\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me,\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests,\nThey know what you look like,\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\nWho your friends are,\nThey pretty much know a lot about you,\nAll sorts of photos,\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there,\nBut at the same time,\nThe whole point\nI think,\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends,\nI don't want to limit it too much,\nSo it's a tricky issue,\nBecause I only accept people I know,\nI mean you never know really,\nWho can look at what,\nSo\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school,\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school,\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange,\nLike I wasn't sure how,\nHow high school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue,\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",

            "Yes, indeed, I believe that gender discrimination is still prevalent in the United States. It's not just women, though; discrimination can also occur within specific job fields. For example, women face the \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite their qualifications, they may not be promoted to higher positions because it's not customary for women to hold such roles. Similarly, men who stay at home to care for their children face societal disapproval, as society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they're straight, as they are perceived as not understanding women's fashion. I feel that gender discrimination exists across various industries and locations. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's crucial to continue promoting the qualities of those stereotyped against without being too forceful. In the meantime, we must recognize that people from different backgrounds can also face discrimination, whether due to their gender, job type, or where they grew from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This change reduced marijuana possession from a criminal offense to a minor infraction similar to getting a traffic ticket, where you receive a citation rather than experiencing arrest and other legal processes. When someone is cited for possessing marijuana, it can still negatively impact job prospects and other life aspects, as is the case with drug charges. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on law enforcement and the legal system, potentially saving money. However, some communities may be financially strained and philosophically opposed to decriminalizing marijuana. In places like Denver, with a more open and liberal mindset, decriminalization may be seen as a viable option to redirect resources into education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be widely available in public spaces, its legalization could lead to it being sold openly, like cigarettes, which could cause issues with public smoking and driving under the influence. Alcohol and marijuana both have adverse effects on individuals, but reactions vary greatly, and moderation is key.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause while many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition and it's good to maintain those roots, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. I believe that a lot of Catholics are very strict about following the weekly church attendance and doctrine, which can make those who don't adhere to these rules feel judged or unwelcome. For instance, my parents had different religious beliefs – my mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian – and they were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church due to my father's religion. This lack of tolerance for other religions feels hypocritical considering the Catholic teaching to love others. I feel that the Catholic Church often practices traditions that contradict their teachings due to their outdated nature. I don't believe that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent child molestation, as the issue is more about personal character than marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue. I can't definitively say whether one side is right or wrong because it's such a contentious topic. It's particularly tricky due to the sensitive balance between church and state and how to legally define marriage. I believe all civil unions should be treated the same, regardless of religious or personal beliefs. If a couple is married, I think the government should treat it as a civil union, rather than inquire about its religious significance. As for gay marriage, I think each state should come to a rational decision and push for nationwide recognition. However, amending the constitution to ban it is unreasonable; it's not a pressing enough issue to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian family, so my stance on homosexuality is somewhat complex. I have many gay friends, and while I don't entirely support the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue but rather something that should be decided individually by each state. Many states are democratic and will likely push for gay marriage, and it's important to respect their decisions since people choose to live there. I don't believe the president should impose their views on every state. I think the decision should be left up to individual states, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "I wouldn't say no, in fact. If you consider what Myspace is, it's essentially a platform where you can post things for the public to see. When you post something online, you have to be aware that many people, including school officials, might see it. Therefore, if school officials see it, they have the right to do so, especially if it's to prevent something like a school shooting. Even though they might be checking for things like students drinking or smoking, it's understandable if it helps to make the school safer. It's a public thing, and students should be aware of that. I'm not saying they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it leads them to make the school safer, then I think it's fine. Similarly, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy if it helps the school officials in their duty to keep students safe. I've discussed this with a teacher, and it's important for schools to ensure safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. So, while I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I do understand the concern about privacy. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Initially, I supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. However, I now believe that our response was driven primarily by emotion and a lack of long-term planning. We invaded Iraq unprepared and without a clear strategy. In retrospect, I think the war was a mistake. I'm now strongly against it. I don't believe our presence has done anything to deter further attacks. In fact, I think the internal conflicts in the region are preventing any real progress. I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel that they are capable of fighting each other but not with us. I believe we should have a better plan before entering a conflict. We were more focused on revenge than rational thinking. President Bush, driven by public opinion, declared war on Iraq, which I understand, but I think we could have handled it differently. The lack of unity and clear objectives in our mission hurt our cause. I don't believe we can or should try to change their culture. I think they'll continue to be the same. I don't see enough progress to justify our continued presence, and I believe their situation will deteriorate once we leave. We're only harming ourselves by staying there."
