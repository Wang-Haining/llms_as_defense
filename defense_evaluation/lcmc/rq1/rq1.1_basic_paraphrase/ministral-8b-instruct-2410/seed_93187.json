            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While it has strong views on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is understandable, these views can seem outdated to some. I think adapting to more modern perspectives might help prevent the loss of followers. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which can make them uncomfortable. For instance, those who support abortion or same-sex marriage might not be comfortable in a faith that considers these practices wrong. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past scandals. The Church argues that priests are married to God, but this doesn't preclude them from having family lives like other professionals.",
            "I personally am not against gay marriage. I believe that being gay is not a choice that someone makes consciously. People shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from getting married. I don't think it's a choice that someone makes and it's not something that the federal government should be involved in, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's simply who they are, and they shouldn't be punished or discriminated against for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a compelling reason to keep it illegal. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is an oversimplification as there are many distinct aspects to these relationships. They can be compared to two sides of the same coin; while they differ in aspects, the essence is the same. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage would entail similar civil rights, such as property rights and healthcare provisions for partners, which are currently limited.\n\nScientific studies show that homosexual couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates and child-rearing skills as heterosexual couples. The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding of what gay marriage actually is; it is a legal document from the government, not a religious ceremony. Allowing civil unions while denying marriage is akin to segregation. Furthermore, concerns about adoption and community issues are unfounded, as the issues are more about societal perceptions and treatment of children than about their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states, amending the constitution to reflect this. However, I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the matter, as his views are influenced by his religious beliefs. Most reasons for opposition are moral, but morality varies greatly among individuals and shouldn't be imposed on the entire population. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring other cultural and moral concepts.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about the psychological makeup of homosexuals, but these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Let me clarify something: The fact that a drug is illegal doesn't inherently make it beneficial. While I don't advocate for making such drugs available to the general public, I believe they can be used medicinally. I've seen this with controlled substances like oxycotton, Vicodin, and Percocets. The point is, it's not about the drug's legality, but about its benefits. Regarding marijuana, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol because it's not as harmful as harder drugs. I wouldn't rush to legalize it all at once, but rather gradually, and only after removing the negative stigma surrounding it. People would be more likely to use it responsibly once they see it differently.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less stringent than it once was. When I was young, I used to go to church every Sunday, always dressed in matching outfits with my friends from my private school. Now, the church offers teenage masses that are shorter and more casual, with people dressing more relaxed, even in summer. I've noticed that the church has become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis to morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe pedophilia is a genetic condition that cannot be cured by marital status. I think if a priest wants to marry but also practice their faith, they should consider another religion.",
            "Initially, the idea of the Iraq war was acceptable, but considering the heightened emotions and concerns following the September 11th attacks, I believe the U.S. went to war, in part, based on false pretexts that the administration used to justify their actions. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein's regime with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. This has always troubled me, as it seems like the administration deliberately misled the American public.\n\nColin Powell, who played a significant role in the administration, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the intelligence at the time of his UN presentation. I consider this a breach of office, even an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has been disrespecting the Constitution and has been trying to diminish its authority, especially since the 9/11 attacks. It appears that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and he also sought to expand the nation's energy supply, which again, is a dubious and underhanded approach.\n\nI think the Iraq war has dragged on long enough. However, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The current plan seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm concerned that this could also cause long-term issues, such as disputes over Iraq's sovereignty. From the news reports, the interim government seems weak, with the Prime Minister having limited control and extremist elements vying for power. I don't think that the political process in Iraq is stable right now.",

            "I don't think it's appropriate for states or the federal government to make it legal or consider it as such. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and any attempts to impose power over this issue would go against what's been established. It seems that those pushing for its illegality are favoring one religion over others, as most Christians and Catholics are opposed to it. I believe the government should not decide what churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, and creating an amendment on this would be contradictory and potentially harmful, as it could restrict people's freedom rather than the government's power. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this matter; I believe the decision should be left to the churches. There's no substantial reason other than personal beliefs for pushing this amendment, and it might even positively impact society more than not.",
            "The Iraq War\nInitially, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for war. They attempted to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though the connection was weak. By exploiting the public's anger and emotions, the government started the war in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the government not learning from past mistakes. Many American soldiers lost their lives, and the absence of a functioning government led to chaos. The U.S. tried to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their failed attempt in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and time required for such a transition.\n\nI believe the U.S. should not have entered the war and, if they did, should have better planned for all possible outcomes. The government did not adequately prepare for the aftermath, and the U.S. is still involved in Iraq today, nearly three years later. The U.S. government also misled the American people into believing the war would be quick and successful.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to finish what he started. However, now I'm torn between staying to support Iraq's transition to democracy and the high cost of American lives. The decision to invade Iraq also raises questions about the U.S. priorities, as other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being targeted. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm pessimistic about that happening.",
            "I have always been supportive of same-sex marriage. I believe it’s a personal preference and not something that should be controlled or restricted. It has been scientifically proven that sexual orientation is biological, not a choice, so it seems unfair to deny rights based on something beyond one's control. I find it inhumane to limit people's rights due to something they can't control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't believe that politics or government should interfere with this issue; it's a personal matter, not a state or federal one. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who live together but aren't married because they're not legally allowed to. They function just like any other family. It seems ridiculous that people like Bush would try to interpret the meaning of marriage in their own way.\n\nI've read and heard from many sources that being gay is likely due to biological factors, not environmental ones. I think it's wrong to make a big deal out of a decision that should be private and personal. It's not like someone can't get married in secret; they can just run off to Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to marry, it gets reported in the news. It should be a personal issue, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Once something is shared online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've already faced this issue. Anything you post online can shape others' opinions of you. If you discuss potentially harmful topics like violence, someone might take you seriously and report it. The school can't ignore this because they have a responsibility to act. However, not everything online should be taken literally, as some people might joke about serious topics. A friend of mine had a situation where someone overheard a comment about a school incident, which led to concerned authorities checking the person's Facebook. If something is brought to a school official's attention, they can't ignore it because they need to ensure safety. It's not their job to monitor every social media account, but if they are informed, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake accounts to monitor students either. It's not ethical or their responsibility.",
            "I feel that the war has persisted far too long. Initially, the goal of restoring democracy in another nation seemed noble. However, I believe we've since lost sight of that objective. It seems we're now waging war more to maintain our image as a superpower than for any genuine political reason. The original motivation may have been influenced by personal grievances from George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, that would be justified. However, if personal matters were a factor, it would not be fair. I think we established our purpose clearly in the initial months of the war, but the conflict has dragged on for too long, consuming immense resources that could be better spent on our own domestic issues. The Iraqi government should now be able to fend for itself, and it's time for us to withdraw. Sustaining this war while our own economy struggles with issues like poverty and infrastructure is unsustainable. The billions spent on this conflict could be better allocated to address our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and public works.",
            "Could I ask a question to clarify how this incident occurred?\n\nI wasn't sure, but it seems someone looked online and found information that prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nYes, that's understandable. If you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone. On platforms like Myspace, you might need to accept someone as a friend to see their profile, but you're essentially giving them permission to view your details. When you share information online, you must accept that many people will see it.\n\nHowever, it's impractical for someone to constantly monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues. It could lead to unfair treatment if only certain groups are targeted. It also depends on why someone accessed a profile—were they looking for evidence of potential harm or were they just casually browsing?\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I feel uneasy knowing that there are people out there who can learn a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen cases where people have used this information to meet someone in person, and that can be quite concerning.\n\nI limit what I share, but I also want to stay connected with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but I'm still concerned about who might be looking at my information.\n\nI've heard that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by their school. I find that a bit strange—was the school really in a position to restrict students' online activities?",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe only have this and then another topic that involves discussing the Iraq War\nUm\nYeah\nI mean I feel quite hypocritical speaking about it\nI mean I’m not fond of jumping on the bandwagon with those who claim they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was but it's not as significant anymore\nCause overall, it was widely considered a bad idea, except among the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nAnd um\nI mean you just need to look at the recent polls\nUm\nThey’ve been conducted in the United States, Iraq, and on a global scale\nAnd I mean no\nAbout seventy to eighty percent of the world's population thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis\nUm\nSeventy percent of the troops stationed there think it was a poor decision and that we should withdraw within the year\nUm\nI don’t know\nIt’s just been a complete disaster from the moment we intervened\nAnd now pulling out is going to be a disaster too\nThere’s really no easy solution with anything concerning the Middle East anymore\nUm\nI mean I think it’s just\nThe cultural differences between the United States and Middle Eastern states\nI mean it’s just too vast for any administration to comprehend\nAnd they believe they can impose democracy in places where it doesn’t belong\nIt’s not how\nUm\nThis completely different group of people would choose to live\nI mean yes, Saddam was a bad guy\nI don’t think anyone would dispute that\nBut, we should weigh the pros and cons before invading a country that will likely turn into a disaster\nLike walking into quicksand\nUm\nI don’t even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don’t see a valid reason to stay there anymore\nUm\nI’m sure the administration has hopeful reasons for staying but I don’t agree with them\nI haven’t heard a legitimate reason why we should stay longer than necessary\nUm\nIf they want to leave gradually over a year or a bit longer than that, I wouldn’t mind\nBut, I don’t see a reason to remain now\nUm\nI read a statistic a while ago that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them want us to leave now\nThese are the people we’re trying to help\nTelling us to leave\nUm\nI think they might know better than us\nAnd at least if we ask and they say yes, it’s not our fault if something goes wrong\nYou know if it all goes to pieces we could say we were going to stay but you guys asked us to leave\nUm\nAnd at least we’ll be the good guys\nKind of\nNo\nWe’ll never be seen as the good guys in the Middle East\nBut, it’ll be better than where we stand now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women, but also extends across different industries and job fields. For instance, women often face barriers like the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite being qualified, they may not be considered for promotions due to historical stereotypes. Similarly, men who take on traditionally female roles, such as stay-at-home fathers, can face disapproval. In the fashion industry, men can be dismissed because their involvement might not align with societal expectations. Depending on the field, gender bias can manifest in various ways. While progress is being made, such as women taking on higher executive roles, change is slow and requires patience. Social acceptance of unconventional roles is gradually increasing, necessitating a balanced approach to promoting these changes. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on one's background or grammatical proficiency, not just gender, indicating the multi-faceted nature of bias in society.",
            "My understanding is that while they didn't make it legal, they did decriminalize it, meaning it was downgraded from a criminal offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and brought in. Even though it might not completely erase the future ramifications, such as for job interviews, the costs associated with arrest, booking, and prosecution are significant. Many financially struggling municipalities might not prioritize decriminalization due to these costs, but places like Denver, with a more liberal mindset, might benefit from it. While marijuana shouldn't be made available everywhere, there's a financial argument for decriminalization to free up resources for other purposes. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about making it as widely available as cigarettes, as it could lead to more public smoking and driving under the influence. Both alcohol and marijuana have adverse effects, but the specific impact varies greatly from person to person.",
            "I would agree for several reasons. Many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which has its merits. It’s important to maintain these roots while also being adaptable to change. However, the strict adherence to dogma can sometimes come across as intolerant. A lot of Catholics are required to attend Church weekly and are expected to follow strict guidelines. This can make some people feel unwelcome if they don't fully follow the doctrine, including those of different religions or denominations. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic respectively, were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's denomination. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is often hypocritically not applied to those who don't fit the mold. Therefore, while some Catholic doctrine preaches love and acceptance, the actual practice often feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, I don't believe allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent any issues related to pedophilia, as those actions are likely motivated by personal desires rather than marital status.",
            "I\nI haven't fully decided on this issue\nSo\nI can't say which side is correct\nBut\nI think this is one of the most challenging subjects we're dealing with today\nBecause\nIt's so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage, which can be very tricky without upsetting anyone\nSo\nI'm unsure about\nI think\nAll civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be treated\nAnd\nAs\nDefined by the government\nConsidering it's a sacrament, people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment if they were baptized\nSo\nIf someone is married, I think they should be considered a civil union\nBecause\nThat's essentially what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't be subjected to separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't be asked about the type of marriage they had\nIt's just two people who have united together\nSo\nAnd\nRegarding gay marriage\nI mean\nIt would just be\nTwo people in a civil union\n\nIf all states could reach a logical agreement, they should push to make it a federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd\nIt's\nThe constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it's a significant cause for some people\nBut\nIt's not substantial enough to warrant a constitutional amendment\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define or ban\nGay marriage\nIn short",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, which makes me feel uncertain about homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I don't necessarily endorse their lifestyle, I believe that it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each individual state. Many states lean democratic, and I don't see a reason to disagree with their decisions if they choose to legalize gay marriage, as they reflect the values of the people living there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think each state should decide on its own. I don't agree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't be able to dictate how each state runs. I think this issue should be left to the individual states, not the president, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "To begin with, MySpace is publicly accessible, so when you post on it, you should expect that others, including school authorities, may see it. Thus, I believe it's reasonable for school officials to see your posts if it helps them prevent a school shooting or improve school safety. However, if they are solely monitoring student activities to catch them in trouble, that would be an invasion of privacy. But if their actions lead to a safer school, I don't see it as invasive. Ultimately, everything you post online can be monitored and used against you, so it's essential to be cautious about what you share. School officials should only be monitoring for genuine safety concerns.",
            "Initially, I fully supported the war due to my personal connection to the events of September 11. I was eager to retaliate against those who carried out the attacks, and I believed that a military response would create the same level of chaos they caused here. However, I now realize that our response was driven more by emotion and anger than strategic planning. We entered the conflict unprepared and with a vague understanding of what we were facing. Our approach was reactionary and not based on a clear plan for long-term success. I believe that the war has largely been a wasted effort, as the internal divisions among the locals have hindered our ability to instill lasting change. The people there are more concerned with their own conflicts than engaging with us, and I'm uncertain if our military presence is making a positive difference. I regret that our initial enthusiasm was not tempered by a well-thought-out strategy. Ultimately, I think it's time to leave and allow the situation to stabilize on its own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While it has strong views on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is understandable, these views can seem outdated to some. I think adapting to more modern perspectives might help prevent the loss of followers. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which can make them uncomfortable. For instance, those who support abortion or same-sex marriage might not be comfortable in a faith that considers these practices wrong. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past scandals. The Church argues that priests are married to God, but this doesn't preclude them from having family lives like other professionals.",
            "I personally am not against gay marriage. I believe that being gay is not a choice that someone makes consciously. People shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from getting married. I don't think it's a choice that someone makes and it's not something that the federal government should be involved in, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's simply who they are, and they shouldn't be punished or discriminated against for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a compelling reason to keep it illegal. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is an oversimplification as there are many distinct aspects to these relationships. They can be compared to two sides of the same coin; while they differ in aspects, the essence is the same. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage would entail similar civil rights, such as property rights and healthcare provisions for partners, which are currently limited.\n\nScientific studies show that homosexual couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates and child-rearing skills as heterosexual couples. The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding of what gay marriage actually is; it is a legal document from the government, not a religious ceremony. Allowing civil unions while denying marriage is akin to segregation. Furthermore, concerns about adoption and community issues are unfounded, as the issues are more about societal perceptions and treatment of children than about their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states, amending the constitution to reflect this. However, I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the matter, as his views are influenced by his religious beliefs. Most reasons for opposition are moral, but morality varies greatly among individuals and shouldn't be imposed on the entire population. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring other cultural and moral concepts.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about the psychological makeup of homosexuals, but these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Let me clarify something: The fact that a drug is illegal doesn't inherently make it beneficial. While I don't advocate for making such drugs available to the general public, I believe they can be used medicinally. I've seen this with controlled substances like oxycotton, Vicodin, and Percocets. The point is, it's not about the drug's legality, but about its benefits. Regarding marijuana, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol because it's not as harmful as harder drugs. I wouldn't rush to legalize it all at once, but rather gradually, and only after removing the negative stigma surrounding it. People would be more likely to use it responsibly once they see it differently.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less stringent than it once was. When I was young, I used to go to church every Sunday, always dressed in matching outfits with my friends from my private school. Now, the church offers teenage masses that are shorter and more casual, with people dressing more relaxed, even in summer. I've noticed that the church has become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis to morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe pedophilia is a genetic condition that cannot be cured by marital status. I think if a priest wants to marry but also practice their faith, they should consider another religion.",
            "Initially, the idea of the Iraq war was acceptable, but considering the heightened emotions and concerns following the September 11th attacks, I believe the U.S. went to war, in part, based on false pretexts that the administration used to justify their actions. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein's regime with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. This has always troubled me, as it seems like the administration deliberately misled the American public.\n\nColin Powell, who played a significant role in the administration, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the intelligence at the time of his UN presentation. I consider this a breach of office, even an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has been disrespecting the Constitution and has been trying to diminish its authority, especially since the 9/11 attacks. It appears that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and he also sought to expand the nation's energy supply, which again, is a dubious and underhanded approach.\n\nI think the Iraq war has dragged on long enough. However, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The current plan seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm concerned that this could also cause long-term issues, such as disputes over Iraq's sovereignty. From the news reports, the interim government seems weak, with the Prime Minister having limited control and extremist elements vying for power. I don't think that the political process in Iraq is stable right now.",

            "I don't think it's appropriate for states or the federal government to make it legal or consider it as such. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and any attempts to impose power over this issue would go against what's been established. It seems that those pushing for its illegality are favoring one religion over others, as most Christians and Catholics are opposed to it. I believe the government should not decide what churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, and creating an amendment on this would be contradictory and potentially harmful, as it could restrict people's freedom rather than the government's power. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this matter; I believe the decision should be left to the churches. There's no substantial reason other than personal beliefs for pushing this amendment, and it might even positively impact society more than not.",
            "The Iraq War\nInitially, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for war. They attempted to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though the connection was weak. By exploiting the public's anger and emotions, the government started the war in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the government not learning from past mistakes. Many American soldiers lost their lives, and the absence of a functioning government led to chaos. The U.S. tried to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their failed attempt in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and time required for such a transition.\n\nI believe the U.S. should not have entered the war and, if they did, should have better planned for all possible outcomes. The government did not adequately prepare for the aftermath, and the U.S. is still involved in Iraq today, nearly three years later. The U.S. government also misled the American people into believing the war would be quick and successful.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to finish what he started. However, now I'm torn between staying to support Iraq's transition to democracy and the high cost of American lives. The decision to invade Iraq also raises questions about the U.S. priorities, as other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being targeted. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm pessimistic about that happening.",
            "I have always been supportive of same-sex marriage. I believe it’s a personal preference and not something that should be controlled or restricted. It has been scientifically proven that sexual orientation is biological, not a choice, so it seems unfair to deny rights based on something beyond one's control. I find it inhumane to limit people's rights due to something they can't control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't believe that politics or government should interfere with this issue; it's a personal matter, not a state or federal one. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who live together but aren't married because they're not legally allowed to. They function just like any other family. It seems ridiculous that people like Bush would try to interpret the meaning of marriage in their own way.\n\nI've read and heard from many sources that being gay is likely due to biological factors, not environmental ones. I think it's wrong to make a big deal out of a decision that should be private and personal. It's not like someone can't get married in secret; they can just run off to Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to marry, it gets reported in the news. It should be a personal issue, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Once something is shared online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've already faced this issue. Anything you post online can shape others' opinions of you. If you discuss potentially harmful topics like violence, someone might take you seriously and report it. The school can't ignore this because they have a responsibility to act. However, not everything online should be taken literally, as some people might joke about serious topics. A friend of mine had a situation where someone overheard a comment about a school incident, which led to concerned authorities checking the person's Facebook. If something is brought to a school official's attention, they can't ignore it because they need to ensure safety. It's not their job to monitor every social media account, but if they are informed, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake accounts to monitor students either. It's not ethical or their responsibility.",
            "I feel that the war has persisted far too long. Initially, the goal of restoring democracy in another nation seemed noble. However, I believe we've since lost sight of that objective. It seems we're now waging war more to maintain our image as a superpower than for any genuine political reason. The original motivation may have been influenced by personal grievances from George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, that would be justified. However, if personal matters were a factor, it would not be fair. I think we established our purpose clearly in the initial months of the war, but the conflict has dragged on for too long, consuming immense resources that could be better spent on our own domestic issues. The Iraqi government should now be able to fend for itself, and it's time for us to withdraw. Sustaining this war while our own economy struggles with issues like poverty and infrastructure is unsustainable. The billions spent on this conflict could be better allocated to address our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and public works.",
            "Could I ask a question to clarify how this incident occurred?\n\nI wasn't sure, but it seems someone looked online and found information that prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nYes, that's understandable. If you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone. On platforms like Myspace, you might need to accept someone as a friend to see their profile, but you're essentially giving them permission to view your details. When you share information online, you must accept that many people will see it.\n\nHowever, it's impractical for someone to constantly monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues. It could lead to unfair treatment if only certain groups are targeted. It also depends on why someone accessed a profile—were they looking for evidence of potential harm or were they just casually browsing?\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I feel uneasy knowing that there are people out there who can learn a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen cases where people have used this information to meet someone in person, and that can be quite concerning.\n\nI limit what I share, but I also want to stay connected with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but I'm still concerned about who might be looking at my information.\n\nI've heard that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by their school. I find that a bit strange—was the school really in a position to restrict students' online activities?",

            "I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women, but also extends across different industries and job fields. For instance, women often face barriers like the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite being qualified, they may not be considered for promotions due to historical stereotypes. Similarly, men who take on traditionally female roles, such as stay-at-home fathers, can face disapproval. In the fashion industry, men can be dismissed because their involvement might not align with societal expectations. Depending on the field, gender bias can manifest in various ways. While progress is being made, such as women taking on higher executive roles, change is slow and requires patience. Social acceptance of unconventional roles is gradually increasing, necessitating a balanced approach to promoting these changes. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on one's background or grammatical proficiency, not just gender, indicating the multi-faceted nature of bias in society.",
            "My understanding is that while they didn't make it legal, they did decriminalize it, meaning it was downgraded from a criminal offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and brought in. Even though it might not completely erase the future ramifications, such as for job interviews, the costs associated with arrest, booking, and prosecution are significant. Many financially struggling municipalities might not prioritize decriminalization due to these costs, but places like Denver, with a more liberal mindset, might benefit from it. While marijuana shouldn't be made available everywhere, there's a financial argument for decriminalization to free up resources for other purposes. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about making it as widely available as cigarettes, as it could lead to more public smoking and driving under the influence.

It’s important to maintain these roots while also being adaptable to change. However, the strict adherence to dogma can sometimes come across as intolerant. A lot of Catholics are required to attend Church weekly and are expected to follow strict guidelines. This can make some people feel unwelcome if they don't fully follow the doctrine, including those of different religions or denominations. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic respectively, were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's denomination. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is often hypocritically not applied to those who don't fit the mold. Therefore, while some Catholic doctrine preaches love and acceptance, the actual practice often feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, I don't believe allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent any issues related to pedophilia, as those actions are likely motivated by personal desires rather than marital status.",
            "I\nI haven't fully decided on this issue\nSo\nI can't say which side is correct\nBut\nI think this is one of the most challenging subjects we're dealing with today\nBecause\nIt's so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage, which can be very tricky without upsetting anyone\nSo\nI'm unsure about\nI think\nAll civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be treated\nAnd\nAs\nDefined by the government\nConsidering it's a sacrament, people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment if they were baptized\nSo\nIf someone is married, I think they should be considered a civil union\nBecause\nThat's essentially what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't be subjected to separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't be asked about the type of marriage they had\nIt's just two people who have united together\nSo\nAnd\nRegarding gay marriage\nI mean\nIt would just be\nTwo people in a civil union\n\nIf all states could reach a logical agreement, they should push to make it a federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd\nIt's\nThe constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it's a significant cause for some people\nBut\nIt's not substantial enough to warrant a constitutional amendment\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define or ban\nGay marriage\nIn short",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, which makes me feel uncertain about homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I don't necessarily endorse their lifestyle, I believe that it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each individual state. Many states lean democratic, and I don't see a reason to disagree with their decisions if they choose to legalize gay marriage, as they reflect the values of the people living there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think each state should decide on its own. I don't agree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't be able to dictate how each state runs. I think this issue should be left to the individual states, not the president, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "To begin with, MySpace is publicly accessible, so when you post on it, you should expect that others, including school authorities, may see it. Thus, I believe it's reasonable for school officials to see your posts if it helps them prevent a school shooting or improve school safety. However, if they are solely monitoring student activities to catch them in trouble, that would be an invasion of privacy. But if their actions lead to a safer school, I don't see it as invasive. Ultimately, everything you post online can be monitored and used against you, so it's essential to be cautious about what you share. School officials should only be monitoring for genuine safety concerns.",
            "Initially, I fully supported the war due to my personal connection to the events of September 11. I was eager to retaliate against those who carried out the attacks, and I believed that a military response would create the same level of chaos they caused here. However, I now realize that our response was driven more by emotion and anger than strategic planning. We entered the conflict unprepared and with a vague understanding of what we were facing. Our approach was reactionary and not based on a clear plan for long-term success. I believe that the war has largely been a wasted effort, as the internal divisions among the locals have hindered our ability to instill lasting change. The people there are more concerned with their own conflicts than engaging with us, and I'm uncertain if our military presence is making a positive difference. I regret that our initial enthusiasm was not tempered by a well-thought-out strategy. Ultimately, I think it's time to leave and allow the situation to stabilize on its own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While it has strong views on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is understandable, these views can seem outdated to some. I think adapting to more modern perspectives might help prevent the loss of followers. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which can make them uncomfortable. For instance, those who support abortion or same-sex marriage might not be comfortable in a faith that considers these practices wrong. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past scandals. The Church argues that priests are married to God, but this doesn't preclude them from having family lives like other professionals.",
            "I personally am not against gay marriage. I believe that being gay is not a choice that someone makes consciously. People shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from getting married. I don't think it's a choice that someone makes and it's not something that the federal government should be involved in, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's simply who they are, and they shouldn't be punished or discriminated against for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a compelling reason to keep it illegal. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is an oversimplification as there are many distinct aspects to these relationships. They can be compared to two sides of the same coin; while they differ in aspects, the essence is the same. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage would entail similar civil rights, such as property rights and healthcare provisions for partners, which are currently limited.\n\nScientific studies show that homosexual couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates and child-rearing skills as heterosexual couples. The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding of what gay marriage actually is; it is a legal document from the government, not a religious ceremony. Allowing civil unions while denying marriage is akin to segregation. Furthermore, concerns about adoption and community issues are unfounded, as the issues are more about societal perceptions and treatment of children than about their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states, amending the constitution to reflect this. However, I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the matter, as his views are influenced by his religious beliefs. Most reasons for opposition are moral, but morality varies greatly among individuals and shouldn't be imposed on the entire population. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring other cultural and moral concepts.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about the psychological makeup of homosexuals, but these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Let me clarify something: The fact that a drug is illegal doesn't inherently make it beneficial. While I don't advocate for making such drugs available to the general public, I believe they can be used medicinally. I've seen this with controlled substances like oxycotton, Vicodin, and Percocets. The point is, it's not about the drug's legality, but about its benefits. Regarding marijuana, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol because it's not as harmful as harder drugs. I wouldn't rush to legalize it all at once, but rather gradually, and only after removing the negative stigma surrounding it. People would be more likely to use it responsibly once they see it differently.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less stringent than it once was. When I was young, I used to go to church every Sunday, always dressed in matching outfits with my friends from my private school. Now, the church offers teenage masses that are shorter and more casual, with people dressing more relaxed, even in summer. I've noticed that the church has become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis to morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe pedophilia is a genetic condition that cannot be cured by marital status. I think if a priest wants to marry but also practice their faith, they should consider another religion.",
            "Initially, the idea of the Iraq war was acceptable, but considering the heightened emotions and concerns following the September 11th attacks, I believe the U.S. went to war, in part, based on false pretexts that the administration used to justify their actions. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein's regime with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. This has always troubled me, as it seems like the administration deliberately misled the American public.\n\nColin Powell, who played a significant role in the administration, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the intelligence at the time of his UN presentation. I consider this a breach of office, even an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has been disrespecting the Constitution and has been trying to diminish its authority, especially since the 9/11 attacks. It appears that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and he also sought to expand the nation's energy supply, which again, is a dubious and underhanded approach.\n\nI think the Iraq war has dragged on long enough. However, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The current plan seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm concerned that this could also cause long-term issues, such as disputes over Iraq's sovereignty. From the news reports, the interim government seems weak, with the Prime Minister having limited control and extremist elements vying for power. I don't think that the political process in Iraq is stable right now.",

            "I don't think it's appropriate for states or the federal government to make it legal or consider it as such. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and any attempts to impose power over this issue would go against what's been established. It seems that those pushing for its illegality are favoring one religion over others, as most Christians and Catholics are opposed to it. I believe the government should not decide what churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, and creating an amendment on this would be contradictory and potentially harmful, as it could restrict people's freedom rather than the government's power. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this matter; I believe the decision should be left to the churches. There's no substantial reason other than personal beliefs for pushing this amendment, and it might even positively impact society more than not.",
            "The Iraq War\nInitially, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for war. They attempted to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though the connection was weak. By exploiting the public's anger and emotions, the government started the war in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the government not learning from past mistakes. Many American soldiers lost their lives, and the absence of a functioning government led to chaos. The U.S. tried to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their failed attempt in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and time required for such a transition.\n\nI believe the U.S. should not have entered the war and, if they did, should have better planned for all possible outcomes. The government did not adequately prepare for the aftermath, and the U.S. is still involved in Iraq today, nearly three years later. The U.S. government also misled the American people into believing the war would be quick and successful.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to finish what he started. However, now I'm torn between staying to support Iraq's transition to democracy and the high cost of American lives. The decision to invade Iraq also raises questions about the U.S. priorities, as other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being targeted. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm pessimistic about that happening.",
            "I have always been supportive of same-sex marriage. I believe it’s a personal preference and not something that should be controlled or restricted. It has been scientifically proven that sexual orientation is biological, not a choice, so it seems unfair to deny rights based on something beyond one's control. I find it inhumane to limit people's rights due to something they can't control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't believe that politics or government should interfere with this issue; it's a personal matter, not a state or federal one. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who live together but aren't married because they're not legally allowed to. They function just like any other family. It seems ridiculous that people like Bush would try to interpret the meaning of marriage in their own way.\n\nI've read and heard from many sources that being gay is likely due to biological factors, not environmental ones. I think it's wrong to make a big deal out of a decision that should be private and personal. It's not like someone can't get married in secret; they can just run off to Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to marry, it gets reported in the news. It should be a personal issue, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Once something is shared online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've already faced this issue. Anything you post online can shape others' opinions of you. If you discuss potentially harmful topics like violence, someone might take you seriously and report it. The school can't ignore this because they have a responsibility to act. However, not everything online should be taken literally, as some people might joke about serious topics. A friend of mine had a situation where someone overheard a comment about a school incident, which led to concerned authorities checking the person's Facebook. If something is brought to a school official's attention, they can't ignore it because they need to ensure safety. It's not their job to monitor every social media account, but if they are informed, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake accounts to monitor students either. It's not ethical or their responsibility.",
            "I feel that the war has persisted far too long. Initially, the goal of restoring democracy in another nation seemed noble. However, I believe we've since lost sight of that objective. It seems we're now waging war more to maintain our image as a superpower than for any genuine political reason. The original motivation may have been influenced by personal grievances from George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, that would be justified. However, if personal matters were a factor, it would not be fair. I think we established our purpose clearly in the initial months of the war, but the conflict has dragged on for too long, consuming immense resources that could be better spent on our own domestic issues. The Iraqi government should now be able to fend for itself, and it's time for us to withdraw. Sustaining this war while our own economy struggles with issues like poverty and infrastructure is unsustainable. The billions spent on this conflict could be better allocated to address our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and public works.",
            "Could I ask a question to clarify how this incident occurred?\n\nI wasn't sure, but it seems someone looked online and found information that prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nYes, that's understandable. If you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone. On platforms like Myspace, you might need to accept someone as a friend to see their profile, but you're essentially giving them permission to view your details. When you share information online, you must accept that many people will see it.\n\nHowever, it's impractical for someone to constantly monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues. It could lead to unfair treatment if only certain groups are targeted. It also depends on why someone accessed a profile—were they looking for evidence of potential harm or were they just casually browsing?\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I feel uneasy knowing that there are people out there who can learn a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen cases where people have used this information to meet someone in person, and that can be quite concerning.\n\nI limit what I share, but I also want to stay connected with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but I'm still concerned about who might be looking at my information.\n\nI've heard that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by their school. I find that a bit strange—was the school really in a position to restrict students' online activities?",

            "I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women, but also extends across different industries and job fields. For instance, women often face barriers like the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite being qualified, they may not be considered for promotions due to historical stereotypes. Similarly, men who take on traditionally female roles, such as stay-at-home fathers, can face disapproval. In the fashion industry, men can be dismissed because their involvement might not align with societal expectations. Depending on the field, gender bias can manifest in various ways. While progress is being made, such as women taking on higher executive roles, change is slow and requires patience. Social acceptance of unconventional roles is gradually increasing, necessitating a balanced approach to promoting these changes. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on one's background or grammatical proficiency, not just gender, indicating the multi-faceted nature of bias in society.",
            "My understanding is that while they didn't make it legal, they did decriminalize it, meaning it was downgraded from a criminal offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and brought in. Even though it might not completely erase the future ramifications, such as for job interviews, the costs associated with arrest, booking, and prosecution are significant. Many financially struggling municipalities might not prioritize decriminalization due to these costs, but places like Denver, with a more liberal mindset, might benefit from it. While marijuana shouldn't be made available everywhere, there's a financial argument for decriminalization to free up resources for other purposes. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about making it as widely available as cigarettes, as it could lead to more public smoking and driving under the influence.

It’s important to maintain these roots while also being adaptable to change. However, the strict adherence to dogma can sometimes come across as intolerant. A lot of Catholics are required to attend Church weekly and are expected to follow strict guidelines. This can make some people feel unwelcome if they don't fully follow the doctrine, including those of different religions or denominations. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic respectively, were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's denomination. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is often hypocritically not applied to those who don't fit the mold. Therefore, while some Catholic doctrine preaches love and acceptance, the actual practice often feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, I don't believe allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent any issues related to pedophilia, as those actions are likely motivated by personal desires rather than marital status.",
            "I\nI haven't fully decided on this issue\nSo\nI can't say which side is correct\nBut\nI think this is one of the most challenging subjects we're dealing with today\nBecause\nIt's so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage, which can be very tricky without upsetting anyone\nSo\nI'm unsure about\nI think\nAll civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be treated\nAnd\nAs\nDefined by the government\nConsidering it's a sacrament, people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment if they were baptized\nSo\nIf someone is married, I think they should be considered a civil union\nBecause\nThat's essentially what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't be subjected to separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't be asked about the type of marriage they had\nIt's just two people who have united together\nSo\nAnd\nRegarding gay marriage\nI mean\nIt would just be\nTwo people in a civil union\n\nIf all states could reach a logical agreement, they should push to make it a federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd\nIt's\nThe constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it's a significant cause for some people\nBut\nIt's not substantial enough to warrant a constitutional amendment\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define or ban\nGay marriage\nIn short",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, which makes me feel uncertain about homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I don't necessarily endorse their lifestyle, I believe that it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each individual state. Many states lean democratic, and I don't see a reason to disagree with their decisions if they choose to legalize gay marriage, as they reflect the values of the people living there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think each state should decide on its own. I don't agree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't be able to dictate how each state runs. I think this issue should be left to the individual states, not the president, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "To begin with, MySpace is publicly accessible, so when you post on it, you should expect that others, including school authorities, may see it. Thus, I believe it's reasonable for school officials to see your posts if it helps them prevent a school shooting or improve school safety. However, if they are solely monitoring student activities to catch them in trouble, that would be an invasion of privacy. But if their actions lead to a safer school, I don't see it as invasive. Ultimately, everything you post online can be monitored and used against you, so it's essential to be cautious about what you share. School officials should only be monitoring for genuine safety concerns.",
            "Initially, I fully supported the war due to my personal connection to the events of September 11. I was eager to retaliate against those who carried out the attacks, and I believed that a military response would create the same level of chaos they caused here. However, I now realize that our response was driven more by emotion and anger than strategic planning. We entered the conflict unprepared and with a vague understanding of what we were facing. Our approach was reactionary and not based on a clear plan for long-term success. I believe that the war has largely been a wasted effort, as the internal divisions among the locals have hindered our ability to instill lasting change. The people there are more concerned with their own conflicts than engaging with us, and I'm uncertain if our military presence is making a positive difference. I regret that our initial enthusiasm was not tempered by a well-thought-out strategy. Ultimately, I think it's time to leave and allow the situation to stabilize on its own."
