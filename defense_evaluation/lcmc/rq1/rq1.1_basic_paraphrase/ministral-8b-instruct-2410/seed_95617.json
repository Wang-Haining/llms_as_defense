            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes.\nThey seem to be losing members, possibly because they are not inclusive of diverse viewpoints, such as those related to LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and birth control. While their strong stances on these issues are a part of their identity, some of their views can feel outdated. If they were to adopt more modern perspectives, they might retain more of their following. Many people are turning away from the Church due to these reasons. For instance, those who support abortion or LGBTQ+ rights may feel unwelcome in a community that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow married priests or female priests, but I'm not sure if this would have prevented the loss of members. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I believe they could also have a family life and still serve their duties.",
            "I personally don't have an issue with gay marriage. I believe that people's sexual orientation is not a conscious choice, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for it. I can't understand why some people think that a man and a woman can get married while two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem right to me. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do feel it's wrong to say that. I think it's not a choice, like being born with certain traits. I don't think it's the federal government's place to decide this. It's not a legal or moral issue that should concern them. It's just a personal choice, and I don't think the government should interfere with that. In my opinion, gay people shouldn't be treated differently, as their orientation is a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because there is no compelling reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to traditional families, but I think the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships are too vast to consider them the same. It's like two sides of the same coin, but fundamentally different. Moreover, there are numerous civil rights advantages that come with legal marriage, such as property rights, healthcare provisions, and next-of-kin benefits. The idea that a same-sex partner cannot be present in a hospital if one is ill or cannot visit due to not being technically considered family is quite unfair, especially when considering a lifelong commitment. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship success rates and satisfaction levels compared to heterosexual couples. The main concern is the lack of understanding about the nature of same-sex relationships – it's not about church weddings, but rather legal recognition. Legalizing same-sex marriage would be akin to segregation, as it's about ensuring the same legal rights and protections for all couples. Moreover, the concerns about gay couples' children and their integration into society are new and complex, but I believe the focus should be on how children are treated in society, not on their parents' sexual orientation. Lastly, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide and amend the constitution to reflect this change. President Bush's stance on same-sex marriage is largely driven by his religious beliefs, which I believe should not dictate government policies. The moral arguments against same-sex marriage are subjective and vary from person to person, and it's unethical to embrace one religious group's morality while ignoring others. Furthermore, many people's opposition to same-sex marriage stems from unfounded beliefs about homosexuality being a result of trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by scientific research. It's crucial to base our opinions on facts and data from reputable institutions, rather than popular culture or religious beliefs.",
            "During my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for making it widely available to the public, I do believe it should be considered for medicinal uses. After all, many controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in healthcare due to their benefits, not because they're legal. I think we should embrace the potential benefits of marijuana, especially for medical purposes. While I acknowledge the potential for abuse, I believe it's not as severe as with some other substances. If we address the stigma surrounding marijuana, people might use it responsibly, perhaps even for medical usage.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, dressed in cute outfits and matching accessories. Now, they offer a youth mass that’s 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, even wearing beach clothes on summer weekends. While I don't know the church's politics, I've noticed a general shift towards a more casual atmosphere, even in morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests could have prevented the issue, as pedophilia is likely genetic and not something that can be stopped through marriage. The church may have been aware of some cases and tried to cover them up, but I don't think they could have prevented all instances.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but considering the collective shock and trauma from the September 11th attacks, many of us were still processing it when we went into Iraq under the pretense of a connection to Al-Qaeda and the attacks, along with the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Bush administration manipulated these claims to justify their actions, which were later revealed to be false. This has always bothered me deeply, and the Iraq War continues to infuriate me.\n\nThe Bush administration deceived the American people openly and has yet to acknowledge this lie. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case before the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider this a grave offense, almost an impeachable offense. The administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to undermine it since September 11th. I think the younger Bush came into office with a desire for vengeance against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father’s administration, and a goal to secure additional energy resources, which is quite underhanded.\n\nI believe the current situation has dragged on too long, and withdrawing now could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The alternative being considered, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may also create long-term issues due to Iraq's sovereignty and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and the political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control. I can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I have a difficult time discussing the ongoing conflict in Iraq. I think it's pointless, as it was never officially declared a war, and I believe our involvement is largely driven by a desire to demonstrate our power or secure resources like oil. While I understand the initial reasoning behind the invasion, I don't think it's productive to remain in Iraq indefinitely, as it's causing more harm than good. I worry that our presence fuels ongoing violence and instability, and it's unclear whether our efforts to impose democracy will ultimately be successful. I also feel that our involvement prolongs the conflict and could exacerbate tensions between the different factions within Iraq. It's a complex issue, and I struggle to find a clear solution.",
            "I strongly believe it's not appropriate for it to be made legal or for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which suggests that the decision should rest with the churches. Attempting to enforce any control over this issue would defy what is already written in the constitution. I feel that those trying to make it illegal are imposing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the constitution and promoting religious tolerance in the US. I don't think making an amendment about it is right or necessary, as it goes against what is already established. Furthermore, such an amendment would be one of the few that restrict people's rights, not the government's. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be based on his personal Catholic beliefs, which isn't a valid reason. I believe the decision should be made by the churches, not the government, and there's no compelling reason for an amendment except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "I believe the U.S. government was not entirely truthful about the reasons for invading Iraq, attempting to tie the war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to capitalize on the public's outrage. The invasion began in 2003, but I was against it, especially as a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq, like the Vietnam War, has led to a significant loss of American lives, and the government's handling of the aftermath has been inadequate. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to install a democratic one, similar to the Vietnam War efforts against communism. However, I think the government underestimated the challenges and the time needed for implementing a new government. The US government also didn't plan for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. Now, almost three years later, we're still in Iraq, training Iraqi troops and police, and many American soldiers are still dying. I believe the government should have been better prepared. In the 2004 election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to complete what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult, given the high number of American casualties. The original reason for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic nation, but the U.S. hasn't applied this principle to other countries. I think the oil issue and the search for weapons of mass destruction were significant factors in the decision. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, while North Korea, which has them, hasn't been targeted. I hope the war ends soon and peace comes to Iraq, but it's unlikely to happen soon.",
            "I support same-sex marriage and always have. I believe it's a matter of personal preference and, increasingly, is being backed by scientific evidence that suggests it's biological rather than societal, which makes it unfair to deny rights based on something people can't control. I find it inhumane to restrict their rights. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should intervene in this personal matter; it's between individuals and their families, not the government. In my neighborhood, I know of several gay couples who are not married but function the same as any other family. I think it's absurd for the government to dictate marriage based on personal beliefs. I've heard and read that being gay could be influenced by brain chemistry, not societal factors. Other than that, marriage is something that individuals can choose freely, regardless of who they are. The same applies to same-sex couples; it should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "Once something is posted online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've encountered this issue firsthand. When you share information on the internet, it can influence people's perceptions of you. If you discuss harmful topics like explosions or shootings, someone might react. The internet is accessible to everyone, and even if it's not the school receiving the message, someone might bring it to their attention. Schools can't ignore potential threats; they must take action. However, not everything online should be taken seriously, as some people may joke about such things. Recently, a situation arose where someone overheard a comment at school that led to concern when a friend checked the person's Facebook. The comment, intended as a joke, became serious. When posting online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your information. School officials shouldn't friend students on social media or monitor personal conversations. However, if information is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. I don't believe teachers should friend students on platforms like Facebook, and I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. It's not appropriate for me to monitor their online activities.",
            "The war has been dragging on far too long, and I believe that while the initial goal was noble—restoring democracy in another country—we have since lost sight of that aim. Our actions now seem more about maintaining our global superpower status than the original purpose. The motivations behind the war might have been questionable, given previous conflicts involving Saddam Hussein and George Bush's father. If our goal was to bring democracy to an oppressive regime, then it was a valid cause. However, I think the war has become about prolonging our involvement rather than achieving a clear victory. It has now lasted far too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over and handle their own affairs. We've been spending billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and citizens at home suffer. Our resources would be better spent on addressing domestic issues like poverty, improving infrastructure, and healthcare. The endless war is a drain on our country and has lost its initial purpose.",

            "Well, um, we’ve got this one more thing I need to discuss about the Iraq War. I feel awkward bringing it up, like I don’t want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start. Yet, it’s not really relevant anymore because the global consensus was that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong. Polls show that around seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, including most Iraqis and many U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should leave within the year. It’s been a disaster from the start, and pulling out would also be chaotic. The cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East is too vast for any administration to understand. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but the pros and cons of invading should have been weighed before the disaster began. It’s like we stepped into a quicksand. I can’t think of a good reason to stay. If we decide to leave gradually over the course of a year or so, that’s fine. But, I don’t see a compelling reason to stay longer. Around eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave now, and they’re the ones we’re trying to help. If they say leave, then we can’t be blamed if things go wrong. We could still help them later, and at least we’d be the good guys, even if we never are in their eyes.",
            "Yes, I agree that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, but also the specific fields and industries you're involved in. Women, for instance, often face issues like the \"glass ceiling,\" where they can't be promoted to certain positions because of societal expectations. Men also face stereotyping, like being devalued in fields like fashion or being expected to be the primary breadwinners. Change is slow, but it's happening. It's essential to promote positive examples gradually rather than forcing change. Additionally, discrimination isn't just about gender; it can also be based on background, like coming from a rural area or having less than perfect grammar.",
            "The person is explaining that while marijuana has been decriminalized, not legalized, which means it's treated more like a traffic ticket rather than a criminal offense. This change in classification can have long-term consequences like job interview difficulties, similar to the worst impacts of a drug charge. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that arresting and processing individuals for possession is costly for municipalities. In places like Denver, where societal views are more liberal, this approach is acceptable and has freed up funds for public education, social programs, and assistance for marginalized groups. However, the speaker feels that legalization would make marijuana too widely available, potentially leading to more smoking in public and possibly more impaired driving, which might be socially unacceptable. Alcohol, while having more immediate effects on motor skills, might have a more adverse overall impact on lifestyle compared to marijuana, though individual reactions can vary greatly.",
            "I'd lean towards yes when considering the concept. While many of the practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which is valuable, it's crucial to also be flexible and adaptable to change. For instance, many Catholics strictly follow weekly church attendance and adhere to precise rituals. However, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church is judgmental of those who don't follow these guidelines to the letter, even those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents' marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church because my father was an Episcopalian, which seems inconsistent with their teachings on love and acceptance. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily prevent issues like pedophilia, as the problem seems to stem from a different area. I believe priests with or without spouses could potentially commit these acts, and thus, this change wouldn't likely prevent such incidents.",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. It's tricky because it involves balancing the separation of church and state and defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure if marriage should be defined by the government like it's a sacrament, as some people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment just because they were baptized. So, if someone is married, I think it should be treated like a civil union because that's essentially what it is - two people united together. Gay marriage, for instance, would simply be two people forming a civil union. I believe that if all states can agree on a logical framework, they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's not a significant enough cause to amend the constitution. It's simply not important enough to define marriage or ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my feelings about homosexuality are a bit complex. Although I have many gay friends and I don't fully support that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather decided by each state individually. Just like many states are democratic and many are republican, it makes sense for each state to decide on its own stance on gay marriage. Living in a state that supports a certain position is a reflection of your own choice, so it's not right for me to disagree with that state's decision. Moreover, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion. I don't think President Bush should impose his views on the entire country regarding gay marriage. He should not be the one to decide how each state should run its own affairs, as he won't be in office forever. If a future democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a back-and-forth situation. Ultimately, it should be up to each individual state to make that decision, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences, not the president.",

            "Initially, I was all for going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much damage as they did to us. However, I believe that the emotional response overshadowed long-term planning and preparedness. We were ill-equipped and lacked a clear strategy. I now believe the war backfired and wasn't effective. I originally supported it, but now I'm against it. I think the people there are so focused on fighting each other that they can't focus on us. I've lost interest in their internal affairs due to 9/11. I don't think we can change those people as they continuously fight amongst themselves. We were unprepared and didn't understand the culture of war there. We were driven by revenge and public sentiment. President Bush acted under pressure, but I understand why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't let them get away with their actions. However, we needed a better plan. There was a lack of unity and clarity in our goals. The situation has dragged on too long with insufficient progress. Staying there won't make a difference, and it's harming us more than helping. I think we should withdraw."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes.\nThey seem to be losing members, possibly because they are not inclusive of diverse viewpoints, such as those related to LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and birth control. While their strong stances on these issues are a part of their identity, some of their views can feel outdated. If they were to adopt more modern perspectives, they might retain more of their following. Many people are turning away from the Church due to these reasons. For instance, those who support abortion or LGBTQ+ rights may feel unwelcome in a community that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow married priests or female priests, but I'm not sure if this would have prevented the loss of members. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I believe they could also have a family life and still serve their duties.",
            "I personally don't have an issue with gay marriage. I believe that people's sexual orientation is not a conscious choice, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for it. I can't understand why some people think that a man and a woman can get married while two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem right to me. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do feel it's wrong to say that. I think it's not a choice, like being born with certain traits. I don't think it's the federal government's place to decide this. It's not a legal or moral issue that should concern them. It's just a personal choice, and I don't think the government should interfere with that. In my opinion, gay people shouldn't be treated differently, as their orientation is a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because there is no compelling reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to traditional families, but I think the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships are too vast to consider them the same. It's like two sides of the same coin, but fundamentally different. Moreover, there are numerous civil rights advantages that come with legal marriage, such as property rights, healthcare provisions, and next-of-kin benefits. The idea that a same-sex partner cannot be present in a hospital if one is ill or cannot visit due to not being technically considered family is quite unfair, especially when considering a lifelong commitment. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship success rates and satisfaction levels compared to heterosexual couples. The main concern is the lack of understanding about the nature of same-sex relationships – it's not about church weddings, but rather legal recognition. Legalizing same-sex marriage would be akin to segregation, as it's about ensuring the same legal rights and protections for all couples. Moreover, the concerns about gay couples' children and their integration into society are new and complex, but I believe the focus should be on how children are treated in society, not on their parents' sexual orientation. Lastly, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide and amend the constitution to reflect this change. President Bush's stance on same-sex marriage is largely driven by his religious beliefs, which I believe should not dictate government policies. The moral arguments against same-sex marriage are subjective and vary from person to person, and it's unethical to embrace one religious group's morality while ignoring others. Furthermore, many people's opposition to same-sex marriage stems from unfounded beliefs about homosexuality being a result of trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by scientific research. It's crucial to base our opinions on facts and data from reputable institutions, rather than popular culture or religious beliefs.",
            "During my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for making it widely available to the public, I do believe it should be considered for medicinal uses. After all, many controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in healthcare due to their benefits, not because they're legal. I think we should embrace the potential benefits of marijuana, especially for medical purposes. While I acknowledge the potential for abuse, I believe it's not as severe as with some other substances. If we address the stigma surrounding marijuana, people might use it responsibly, perhaps even for medical usage.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, dressed in cute outfits and matching accessories. Now, they offer a youth mass that’s 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, even wearing beach clothes on summer weekends. While I don't know the church's politics, I've noticed a general shift towards a more casual atmosphere, even in morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests could have prevented the issue, as pedophilia is likely genetic and not something that can be stopped through marriage. The church may have been aware of some cases and tried to cover them up, but I don't think they could have prevented all instances.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but considering the collective shock and trauma from the September 11th attacks, many of us were still processing it when we went into Iraq under the pretense of a connection to Al-Qaeda and the attacks, along with the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Bush administration manipulated these claims to justify their actions, which were later revealed to be false. This has always bothered me deeply, and the Iraq War continues to infuriate me.\n\nThe Bush administration deceived the American people openly and has yet to acknowledge this lie. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case before the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider this a grave offense, almost an impeachable offense. The administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to undermine it since September 11th. I think the younger Bush came into office with a desire for vengeance against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father’s administration, and a goal to secure additional energy resources, which is quite underhanded.\n\nI believe the current situation has dragged on too long, and withdrawing now could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The alternative being considered, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may also create long-term issues due to Iraq's sovereignty and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and the political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control. I can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I have a difficult time discussing the ongoing conflict in Iraq. I think it's pointless, as it was never officially declared a war, and I believe our involvement is largely driven by a desire to demonstrate our power or secure resources like oil. While I understand the initial reasoning behind the invasion, I don't think it's productive to remain in Iraq indefinitely, as it's causing more harm than good. I worry that our presence fuels ongoing violence and instability, and it's unclear whether our efforts to impose democracy will ultimately be successful. I also feel that our involvement prolongs the conflict and could exacerbate tensions between the different factions within Iraq. It's a complex issue, and I struggle to find a clear solution.",
            "I strongly believe it's not appropriate for it to be made legal or for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which suggests that the decision should rest with the churches. Attempting to enforce any control over this issue would defy what is already written in the constitution. I feel that those trying to make it illegal are imposing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the constitution and promoting religious tolerance in the US. I don't think making an amendment about it is right or necessary, as it goes against what is already established. Furthermore, such an amendment would be one of the few that restrict people's rights, not the government's. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be based on his personal Catholic beliefs, which isn't a valid reason. I believe the decision should be made by the churches, not the government, and there's no compelling reason for an amendment except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "I believe the U.S. government was not entirely truthful about the reasons for invading Iraq, attempting to tie the war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to capitalize on the public's outrage. The invasion began in 2003, but I was against it, especially as a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq, like the Vietnam War, has led to a significant loss of American lives, and the government's handling of the aftermath has been inadequate. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to install a democratic one, similar to the Vietnam War efforts against communism. However, I think the government underestimated the challenges and the time needed for implementing a new government. The US government also didn't plan for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. Now, almost three years later, we're still in Iraq, training Iraqi troops and police, and many American soldiers are still dying. I believe the government should have been better prepared. In the 2004 election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to complete what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult, given the high number of American casualties. The original reason for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic nation, but the U.S. hasn't applied this principle to other countries. I think the oil issue and the search for weapons of mass destruction were significant factors in the decision. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, while North Korea, which has them, hasn't been targeted. I hope the war ends soon and peace comes to Iraq, but it's unlikely to happen soon.",
            "I support same-sex marriage and always have. I believe it's a matter of personal preference and, increasingly, is being backed by scientific evidence that suggests it's biological rather than societal, which makes it unfair to deny rights based on something people can't control. I find it inhumane to restrict their rights. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should intervene in this personal matter; it's between individuals and their families, not the government. In my neighborhood, I know of several gay couples who are not married but function the same as any other family. I think it's absurd for the government to dictate marriage based on personal beliefs. I've heard and read that being gay could be influenced by brain chemistry, not societal factors. Other than that, marriage is something that individuals can choose freely, regardless of who they are. The same applies to same-sex couples; it should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "Once something is posted online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've encountered this issue firsthand. When you share information on the internet, it can influence people's perceptions of you. If you discuss harmful topics like explosions or shootings, someone might react. The internet is accessible to everyone, and even if it's not the school receiving the message, someone might bring it to their attention. Schools can't ignore potential threats; they must take action. However, not everything online should be taken seriously, as some people may joke about such things. Recently, a situation arose where someone overheard a comment at school that led to concern when a friend checked the person's Facebook. The comment, intended as a joke, became serious. When posting online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your information. School officials shouldn't friend students on social media or monitor personal conversations. However, if information is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. I don't believe teachers should friend students on platforms like Facebook, and I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. It's not appropriate for me to monitor their online activities.",
            "The war has been dragging on far too long, and I believe that while the initial goal was noble—restoring democracy in another country—we have since lost sight of that aim. Our actions now seem more about maintaining our global superpower status than the original purpose. The motivations behind the war might have been questionable, given previous conflicts involving Saddam Hussein and George Bush's father. If our goal was to bring democracy to an oppressive regime, then it was a valid cause. However, I think the war has become about prolonging our involvement rather than achieving a clear victory. It has now lasted far too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over and handle their own affairs. We've been spending billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and citizens at home suffer. Our resources would be better spent on addressing domestic issues like poverty, improving infrastructure, and healthcare. The endless war is a drain on our country and has lost its initial purpose.",

            "Well, um, we’ve got this one more thing I need to discuss about the Iraq War. I feel awkward bringing it up, like I don’t want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start. Yet, it’s not really relevant anymore because the global consensus was that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong. Polls show that around seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, including most Iraqis and many U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should leave within the year. It’s been a disaster from the start, and pulling out would also be chaotic. The cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East is too vast for any administration to understand. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but the pros and cons of invading should have been weighed before the disaster began. It’s like we stepped into a quicksand. I can’t think of a good reason to stay. If we decide to leave gradually over the course of a year or so, that’s fine. But, I don’t see a compelling reason to stay longer. Around eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave now, and they’re the ones we’re trying to help. If they say leave, then we can’t be blamed if things go wrong. We could still help them later, and at least we’d be the good guys, even if we never are in their eyes.",
            "Yes, I agree that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, but also the specific fields and industries you're involved in. Women, for instance, often face issues like the \"glass ceiling,\" where they can't be promoted to certain positions because of societal expectations. Men also face stereotyping, like being devalued in fields like fashion or being expected to be the primary breadwinners. Change is slow, but it's happening. It's essential to promote positive examples gradually rather than forcing change. Additionally, discrimination isn't just about gender; it can also be based on background, like coming from a rural area or having less than perfect grammar.",
            "The person is explaining that while marijuana has been decriminalized, not legalized, which means it's treated more like a traffic ticket rather than a criminal offense. This change in classification can have long-term consequences like job interview difficulties, similar to the worst impacts of a drug charge. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that arresting and processing individuals for possession is costly for municipalities. In places like Denver, where societal views are more liberal, this approach is acceptable and has freed up funds for public education, social programs, and assistance for marginalized groups. However, the speaker feels that legalization would make marijuana too widely available, potentially leading to more smoking in public and possibly more impaired driving, which might be socially unacceptable. Alcohol, while having more immediate effects on motor skills, might have a more adverse overall impact on lifestyle compared to marijuana, though individual reactions can vary greatly.",
            "I'd lean towards yes when considering the concept. While many of the practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which is valuable, it's crucial to also be flexible and adaptable to change. For instance, many Catholics strictly follow weekly church attendance and adhere to precise rituals. However, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church is judgmental of those who don't follow these guidelines to the letter, even those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents' marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church because my father was an Episcopalian, which seems inconsistent with their teachings on love and acceptance. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily prevent issues like pedophilia, as the problem seems to stem from a different area. I believe priests with or without spouses could potentially commit these acts, and thus, this change wouldn't likely prevent such incidents.",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. It's tricky because it involves balancing the separation of church and state and defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure if marriage should be defined by the government like it's a sacrament, as some people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment just because they were baptized. So, if someone is married, I think it should be treated like a civil union because that's essentially what it is - two people united together. Gay marriage, for instance, would simply be two people forming a civil union. I believe that if all states can agree on a logical framework, they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's not a significant enough cause to amend the constitution. It's simply not important enough to define marriage or ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my feelings about homosexuality are a bit complex. Although I have many gay friends and I don't fully support that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather decided by each state individually. Just like many states are democratic and many are republican, it makes sense for each state to decide on its own stance on gay marriage. Living in a state that supports a certain position is a reflection of your own choice, so it's not right for me to disagree with that state's decision. Moreover, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion. I don't think President Bush should impose his views on the entire country regarding gay marriage. He should not be the one to decide how each state should run its own affairs, as he won't be in office forever. If a future democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a back-and-forth situation. Ultimately, it should be up to each individual state to make that decision, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Here's the paraphrased version:\n\nUm\nNo, I don't think so\nUm\nLet's see, I\nThe way I understand it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat's mainly to post publicly\nFor others to see\nUm\nWhatever your goal is\nAnd\nNow, if you post something on the internet\nUm\nYou have to realize that people will see it\nWhether it's school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though school officials seeing that\nThey had the right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed it\nUh\nThrough their own means\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat's perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are engaging in activities they shouldn't be doing\nThey go on there specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut  Um\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nLives or make the school a safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt’s public\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nI’m\nUh\nWorried to post anything online\nUm\nLike if I have something not good to say about someone I don’t ever post it online\nBecause\nI’m afraid someone might find it\nAnd you know\nEverything nowadays comes back to bite you\nUm\nLike  if you do something while you’re in college and you become important later on they’ll find an email you sent and use it against you\nAnd once it is on the internet it’s always there\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nIt wasn’t an invasion of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that's basically all I’ve been saying was it’s public\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before, I don’t think they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock-downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drills\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was in case people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that's basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was all for going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much damage as they did to us. However, I believe that the emotional response overshadowed long-term planning and preparedness. We were ill-equipped and lacked a clear strategy. I now believe the war backfired and wasn't effective. I originally supported it, but now I'm against it. I think the people there are so focused on fighting each other that they can't focus on us. I've lost interest in their internal affairs due to 9/11. I don't think we can change those people as they continuously fight amongst themselves. We were unprepared and didn't understand the culture of war there. We were driven by revenge and public sentiment. President Bush acted under pressure, but I understand why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't let them get away with their actions. However, we needed a better plan. There was a lack of unity and clarity in our goals. The situation has dragged on too long with insufficient progress. Staying there won't make a difference, and it's harming us more than helping. I think we should withdraw."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes.\nThey seem to be losing members, possibly because they are not inclusive of diverse viewpoints, such as those related to LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and birth control. While their strong stances on these issues are a part of their identity, some of their views can feel outdated. If they were to adopt more modern perspectives, they might retain more of their following. Many people are turning away from the Church due to these reasons. For instance, those who support abortion or LGBTQ+ rights may feel unwelcome in a community that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow married priests or female priests, but I'm not sure if this would have prevented the loss of members. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I believe they could also have a family life and still serve their duties.",
            "I personally don't have an issue with gay marriage. I believe that people's sexual orientation is not a conscious choice, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for it. I can't understand why some people think that a man and a woman can get married while two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem right to me. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do feel it's wrong to say that. I think it's not a choice, like being born with certain traits. I don't think it's the federal government's place to decide this. It's not a legal or moral issue that should concern them. It's just a personal choice, and I don't think the government should interfere with that. In my opinion, gay people shouldn't be treated differently, as their orientation is a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because there is no compelling reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to traditional families, but I think the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships are too vast to consider them the same. It's like two sides of the same coin, but fundamentally different. Moreover, there are numerous civil rights advantages that come with legal marriage, such as property rights, healthcare provisions, and next-of-kin benefits. The idea that a same-sex partner cannot be present in a hospital if one is ill or cannot visit due to not being technically considered family is quite unfair, especially when considering a lifelong commitment. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship success rates and satisfaction levels compared to heterosexual couples. The main concern is the lack of understanding about the nature of same-sex relationships – it's not about church weddings, but rather legal recognition. Legalizing same-sex marriage would be akin to segregation, as it's about ensuring the same legal rights and protections for all couples. Moreover, the concerns about gay couples' children and their integration into society are new and complex, but I believe the focus should be on how children are treated in society, not on their parents' sexual orientation. Lastly, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide and amend the constitution to reflect this change. President Bush's stance on same-sex marriage is largely driven by his religious beliefs, which I believe should not dictate government policies. The moral arguments against same-sex marriage are subjective and vary from person to person, and it's unethical to embrace one religious group's morality while ignoring others. Furthermore, many people's opposition to same-sex marriage stems from unfounded beliefs about homosexuality being a result of trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by scientific research. It's crucial to base our opinions on facts and data from reputable institutions, rather than popular culture or religious beliefs.",
            "During my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for making it widely available to the public, I do believe it should be considered for medicinal uses. After all, many controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in healthcare due to their benefits, not because they're legal. I think we should embrace the potential benefits of marijuana, especially for medical purposes. While I acknowledge the potential for abuse, I believe it's not as severe as with some other substances. If we address the stigma surrounding marijuana, people might use it responsibly, perhaps even for medical usage.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, dressed in cute outfits and matching accessories. Now, they offer a youth mass that’s 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, even wearing beach clothes on summer weekends. While I don't know the church's politics, I've noticed a general shift towards a more casual atmosphere, even in morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests could have prevented the issue, as pedophilia is likely genetic and not something that can be stopped through marriage. The church may have been aware of some cases and tried to cover them up, but I don't think they could have prevented all instances.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but considering the collective shock and trauma from the September 11th attacks, many of us were still processing it when we went into Iraq under the pretense of a connection to Al-Qaeda and the attacks, along with the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Bush administration manipulated these claims to justify their actions, which were later revealed to be false. This has always bothered me deeply, and the Iraq War continues to infuriate me.\n\nThe Bush administration deceived the American people openly and has yet to acknowledge this lie. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case before the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider this a grave offense, almost an impeachable offense. The administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to undermine it since September 11th. I think the younger Bush came into office with a desire for vengeance against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father’s administration, and a goal to secure additional energy resources, which is quite underhanded.\n\nI believe the current situation has dragged on too long, and withdrawing now could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The alternative being considered, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may also create long-term issues due to Iraq's sovereignty and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and the political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control. I can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I have a difficult time discussing the ongoing conflict in Iraq. I think it's pointless, as it was never officially declared a war, and I believe our involvement is largely driven by a desire to demonstrate our power or secure resources like oil. While I understand the initial reasoning behind the invasion, I don't think it's productive to remain in Iraq indefinitely, as it's causing more harm than good. I worry that our presence fuels ongoing violence and instability, and it's unclear whether our efforts to impose democracy will ultimately be successful. I also feel that our involvement prolongs the conflict and could exacerbate tensions between the different factions within Iraq. It's a complex issue, and I struggle to find a clear solution.",
            "I strongly believe it's not appropriate for it to be made legal or for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which suggests that the decision should rest with the churches. Attempting to enforce any control over this issue would defy what is already written in the constitution. I feel that those trying to make it illegal are imposing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the constitution and promoting religious tolerance in the US. I don't think making an amendment about it is right or necessary, as it goes against what is already established. Furthermore, such an amendment would be one of the few that restrict people's rights, not the government's. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be based on his personal Catholic beliefs, which isn't a valid reason. I believe the decision should be made by the churches, not the government, and there's no compelling reason for an amendment except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "I believe the U.S. government was not entirely truthful about the reasons for invading Iraq, attempting to tie the war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to capitalize on the public's outrage. The invasion began in 2003, but I was against it, especially as a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq, like the Vietnam War, has led to a significant loss of American lives, and the government's handling of the aftermath has been inadequate. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to install a democratic one, similar to the Vietnam War efforts against communism. However, I think the government underestimated the challenges and the time needed for implementing a new government. The US government also didn't plan for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. Now, almost three years later, we're still in Iraq, training Iraqi troops and police, and many American soldiers are still dying. I believe the government should have been better prepared. In the 2004 election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to complete what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult, given the high number of American casualties. The original reason for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic nation, but the U.S. hasn't applied this principle to other countries. I think the oil issue and the search for weapons of mass destruction were significant factors in the decision. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, while North Korea, which has them, hasn't been targeted. I hope the war ends soon and peace comes to Iraq, but it's unlikely to happen soon.",
            "I support same-sex marriage and always have. I believe it's a matter of personal preference and, increasingly, is being backed by scientific evidence that suggests it's biological rather than societal, which makes it unfair to deny rights based on something people can't control. I find it inhumane to restrict their rights. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should intervene in this personal matter; it's between individuals and their families, not the government. In my neighborhood, I know of several gay couples who are not married but function the same as any other family. I think it's absurd for the government to dictate marriage based on personal beliefs. I've heard and read that being gay could be influenced by brain chemistry, not societal factors. Other than that, marriage is something that individuals can choose freely, regardless of who they are. The same applies to same-sex couples; it should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "Once something is posted online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've encountered this issue firsthand. When you share information on the internet, it can influence people's perceptions of you. If you discuss harmful topics like explosions or shootings, someone might react. The internet is accessible to everyone, and even if it's not the school receiving the message, someone might bring it to their attention. Schools can't ignore potential threats; they must take action. However, not everything online should be taken seriously, as some people may joke about such things. Recently, a situation arose where someone overheard a comment at school that led to concern when a friend checked the person's Facebook. The comment, intended as a joke, became serious. When posting online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your information. School officials shouldn't friend students on social media or monitor personal conversations. However, if information is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. I don't believe teachers should friend students on platforms like Facebook, and I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. It's not appropriate for me to monitor their online activities.",
            "The war has been dragging on far too long, and I believe that while the initial goal was noble—restoring democracy in another country—we have since lost sight of that aim. Our actions now seem more about maintaining our global superpower status than the original purpose. The motivations behind the war might have been questionable, given previous conflicts involving Saddam Hussein and George Bush's father. If our goal was to bring democracy to an oppressive regime, then it was a valid cause. However, I think the war has become about prolonging our involvement rather than achieving a clear victory. It has now lasted far too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over and handle their own affairs. We've been spending billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and citizens at home suffer. Our resources would be better spent on addressing domestic issues like poverty, improving infrastructure, and healthcare. The endless war is a drain on our country and has lost its initial purpose.",

            "Well, um, we’ve got this one more thing I need to discuss about the Iraq War. I feel awkward bringing it up, like I don’t want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start. Yet, it’s not really relevant anymore because the global consensus was that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong. Polls show that around seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, including most Iraqis and many U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should leave within the year. It’s been a disaster from the start, and pulling out would also be chaotic. The cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East is too vast for any administration to understand. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but the pros and cons of invading should have been weighed before the disaster began. It’s like we stepped into a quicksand. I can’t think of a good reason to stay. If we decide to leave gradually over the course of a year or so, that’s fine. But, I don’t see a compelling reason to stay longer. Around eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave now, and they’re the ones we’re trying to help. If they say leave, then we can’t be blamed if things go wrong. We could still help them later, and at least we’d be the good guys, even if we never are in their eyes.",
            "Yes, I agree that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, but also the specific fields and industries you're involved in. Women, for instance, often face issues like the \"glass ceiling,\" where they can't be promoted to certain positions because of societal expectations. Men also face stereotyping, like being devalued in fields like fashion or being expected to be the primary breadwinners. Change is slow, but it's happening. It's essential to promote positive examples gradually rather than forcing change. Additionally, discrimination isn't just about gender; it can also be based on background, like coming from a rural area or having less than perfect grammar.",
            "The person is explaining that while marijuana has been decriminalized, not legalized, which means it's treated more like a traffic ticket rather than a criminal offense. This change in classification can have long-term consequences like job interview difficulties, similar to the worst impacts of a drug charge. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that arresting and processing individuals for possession is costly for municipalities. In places like Denver, where societal views are more liberal, this approach is acceptable and has freed up funds for public education, social programs, and assistance for marginalized groups. However, the speaker feels that legalization would make marijuana too widely available, potentially leading to more smoking in public and possibly more impaired driving, which might be socially unacceptable. Alcohol, while having more immediate effects on motor skills, might have a more adverse overall impact on lifestyle compared to marijuana, though individual reactions can vary greatly.",
            "I'd lean towards yes when considering the concept. While many of the practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which is valuable, it's crucial to also be flexible and adaptable to change. For instance, many Catholics strictly follow weekly church attendance and adhere to precise rituals. However, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church is judgmental of those who don't follow these guidelines to the letter, even those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents' marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church because my father was an Episcopalian, which seems inconsistent with their teachings on love and acceptance. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily prevent issues like pedophilia, as the problem seems to stem from a different area. I believe priests with or without spouses could potentially commit these acts, and thus, this change wouldn't likely prevent such incidents.",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. It's tricky because it involves balancing the separation of church and state and defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure if marriage should be defined by the government like it's a sacrament, as some people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment just because they were baptized. So, if someone is married, I think it should be treated like a civil union because that's essentially what it is - two people united together. Gay marriage, for instance, would simply be two people forming a civil union. I believe that if all states can agree on a logical framework, they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's not a significant enough cause to amend the constitution. It's simply not important enough to define marriage or ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my feelings about homosexuality are a bit complex. Although I have many gay friends and I don't fully support that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather decided by each state individually. Just like many states are democratic and many are republican, it makes sense for each state to decide on its own stance on gay marriage. Living in a state that supports a certain position is a reflection of your own choice, so it's not right for me to disagree with that state's decision. Moreover, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion. I don't think President Bush should impose his views on the entire country regarding gay marriage. He should not be the one to decide how each state should run its own affairs, as he won't be in office forever. If a future democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a back-and-forth situation. Ultimately, it should be up to each individual state to make that decision, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences, not the president.",

            "Initially, I was all for going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much damage as they did to us. However, I believe that the emotional response overshadowed long-term planning and preparedness. We were ill-equipped and lacked a clear strategy. I now believe the war backfired and wasn't effective. I originally supported it, but now I'm against it. I think the people there are so focused on fighting each other that they can't focus on us. I've lost interest in their internal affairs due to 9/11. I don't think we can change those people as they continuously fight amongst themselves. We were unprepared and didn't understand the culture of war there. We were driven by revenge and public sentiment. President Bush acted under pressure, but I understand why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't let them get away with their actions. However, we needed a better plan. There was a lack of unity and clarity in our goals. The situation has dragged on too long with insufficient progress. Staying there won't make a difference, and it's harming us more than helping. I think we should withdraw."
