            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes.\nThey seem to be losing members, possibly because they are not inclusive of diverse viewpoints, such as those related to LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and birth control. While their strong stances on these issues are a part of their identity, some of their views can feel outdated. If they were to adopt more modern perspectives, they might retain more of their following. Many people are turning away from the Church due to these reasons. For instance, those who support abortion or LGBTQ+ rights may feel unwelcome in a community that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow married priests or female priests, but I'm not sure if this would have prevented the loss of members. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I believe they could also have a family life and still serve their duties.",
            "I personally don't have an issue with gay marriage. I believe that people's sexual orientation is not a conscious choice, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for it. I can't understand why some people think that a man and a woman can get married while two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem right to me. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do feel it's wrong to say that. I think it's not a choice, like being born with certain traits. I don't think it's the federal government's place to decide this. It's not a legal or moral issue that should concern them. It's just a personal choice, and I don't think the government should interfere with that. In my opinion, gay people shouldn't be treated differently, as their orientation is a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because there is no compelling reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to traditional families, but I think the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships are too vast to consider them the same. It's like two sides of the same coin, but fundamentally different. Moreover, there are numerous civil rights advantages that come with legal marriage, such as property rights, healthcare provisions, and next-of-kin benefits. The idea that a same-sex partner cannot be present in a hospital if one is ill or cannot visit due to not being technically considered family is quite unfair, especially when considering a lifelong commitment. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship success rates and satisfaction levels compared to heterosexual couples. The main concern is the lack of understanding about the nature of same-sex relationships – it's not about church weddings, but rather legal recognition. Legalizing same-sex marriage would be akin to segregation, as it's about ensuring the same legal rights and protections for all couples. Moreover, the concerns about gay couples' children and their integration into society are new and complex, but I believe the focus should be on how children are treated in society, not on their parents' sexual orientation. Lastly, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide and amend the constitution to reflect this change. President Bush's stance on same-sex marriage is largely driven by his religious beliefs, which I believe should not dictate government policies. The moral arguments against same-sex marriage are subjective and vary from person to person, and it's unethical to embrace one religious group's morality while ignoring others. Furthermore, many people's opposition to same-sex marriage stems from unfounded beliefs about homosexuality being a result of trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by scientific research. It's crucial to base our opinions on facts and data from reputable institutions, rather than popular culture or religious beliefs.",
            "During my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for making it widely available to the public, I do believe it should be considered for medicinal uses. After all, many controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in healthcare due to their benefits, not because they're legal. I think we should embrace the potential benefits of marijuana, especially for medical purposes. While I acknowledge the potential for abuse, I believe it's not as severe as with some other substances. If we address the stigma surrounding marijuana, people might use it responsibly, perhaps even for medical usage.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, dressed in cute outfits and matching accessories. Now, they offer a youth mass that’s 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, even wearing beach clothes on summer weekends. While I don't know the church's politics, I've noticed a general shift towards a more casual atmosphere, even in morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests could have prevented the issue, as pedophilia is likely genetic and not something that can be stopped through marriage. The church may have been aware of some cases and tried to cover them up, but I don't think they could have prevented all instances.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but considering the collective shock and trauma from the September 11th attacks, many of us were still processing it when we went into Iraq under the pretense of a connection to Al-Qaeda and the attacks, along with the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Bush administration manipulated these claims to justify their actions, which were later revealed to be false. This has always bothered me deeply, and the Iraq War continues to infuriate me.\n\nThe Bush administration deceived the American people openly and has yet to acknowledge this lie. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case before the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider this a grave offense, almost an impeachable offense. The administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to undermine it since September 11th. I think the younger Bush came into office with a desire for vengeance against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father’s administration, and a goal to secure additional energy resources, which is quite underhanded.\n\nI believe the current situation has dragged on too long, and withdrawing now could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The alternative being considered, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may also create long-term issues due to Iraq's sovereignty and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and the political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control. I can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I have a difficult time discussing the ongoing conflict in Iraq. I think it's pointless, as it was never officially declared a war, and I believe our involvement is largely driven by a desire to demonstrate our power or secure resources like oil. While I understand the initial reasoning behind the invasion, I don't think it's productive to remain in Iraq indefinitely, as it's causing more harm than good. I worry that our presence fuels ongoing violence and instability, and it's unclear whether our efforts to impose democracy will ultimately be successful. I also feel that our involvement prolongs the conflict and could exacerbate tensions between the different factions within Iraq. It's a complex issue, and I struggle to find a clear solution.",
            "I strongly believe it's not appropriate for it to be made legal or for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which suggests that the decision should rest with the churches. Attempting to enforce any control over this issue would defy what is already written in the constitution. I feel that those trying to make it illegal are imposing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the constitution and promoting religious tolerance in the US. I don't think making an amendment about it is right or necessary, as it goes against what is already established. Furthermore, such an amendment would be one of the few that restrict people's rights, not the government's. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be based on his personal Catholic beliefs, which isn't a valid reason. I believe the decision should be made by the churches, not the government, and there's no compelling reason for an amendment except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "I believe the U.S. government was not entirely truthful about the reasons for invading Iraq, attempting to tie the war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to capitalize on the public's outrage. The invasion began in 2003, but I was against it, especially as a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq, like the Vietnam War, has led to a significant loss of American lives, and the government's handling of the aftermath has been inadequate. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to install a democratic one, similar to the Vietnam War efforts against communism. However, I think the government underestimated the challenges and the time needed for implementing a new government. The US government also didn't plan for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. Now, almost three years later, we're still in Iraq, training Iraqi troops and police, and many American soldiers are still dying. I believe the government should have been better prepared. In the 2004 election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to complete what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult, given the high number of American casualties. The original reason for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic nation, but the U.S. hasn't applied this principle to other countries. I think the oil issue and the search for weapons of mass destruction were significant factors in the decision. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, while North Korea, which has them, hasn't been targeted. I hope the war ends soon and peace comes to Iraq, but it's unlikely to happen soon.",
            "I support same-sex marriage and always have. I believe it's a matter of personal preference and, increasingly, is being backed by scientific evidence that suggests it's biological rather than societal, which makes it unfair to deny rights based on something people can't control. I find it inhumane to restrict their rights. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should intervene in this personal matter; it's between individuals and their families, not the government. In my neighborhood, I know of several gay couples who are not married but function the same as any other family. I think it's absurd for the government to dictate marriage based on personal beliefs. I've heard and read that being gay could be influenced by brain chemistry, not societal factors. Other than that, marriage is something that individuals can choose freely, regardless of who they are. The same applies to same-sex couples; it should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "Once something is posted online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've encountered this issue firsthand. When you share information on the internet, it can influence people's perceptions of you. If you discuss harmful topics like explosions or shootings, someone might react. The internet is accessible to everyone, and even if it's not the school receiving the message, someone might bring it to their attention. Schools can't ignore potential threats; they must take action. However, not everything online should be taken seriously, as some people may joke about such things. Recently, a situation arose where someone overheard a comment at school that led to concern when a friend checked the person's Facebook. The comment, intended as a joke, became serious. When posting online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your information. School officials shouldn't friend students on social media or monitor personal conversations. However, if information is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. I don't believe teachers should friend students on platforms like Facebook, and I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. It's not appropriate for me to monitor their online activities.",
            "The war has been dragging on far too long, and I believe that while the initial goal was noble—restoring democracy in another country—we have since lost sight of that aim. Our actions now seem more about maintaining our global superpower status than the original purpose. The motivations behind the war might have been questionable, given previous conflicts involving Saddam Hussein and George Bush's father. If our goal was to bring democracy to an oppressive regime, then it was a valid cause. However, I think the war has become about prolonging our involvement rather than achieving a clear victory. It has now lasted far too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over and handle their own affairs. We've been spending billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and citizens at home suffer. Our resources would be better spent on addressing domestic issues like poverty, improving infrastructure, and healthcare. The endless war is a drain on our country and has lost its initial purpose.",

            "Well, um, we’ve got this one more thing I need to discuss about the Iraq War. I feel awkward bringing it up, like I don’t want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start. Yet, it’s not really relevant anymore because the global consensus was that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong. Polls show that around seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, including most Iraqis and many U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should leave within the year. It’s been a disaster from the start, and pulling out would also be chaotic. The cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East is too vast for any administration to understand. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but the pros and cons of invading should have been weighed before the disaster began. It’s like we stepped into a quicksand. I can’t think of a good reason to stay. If we decide to leave gradually over the course of a year or so, that’s fine. But, I don’t see a compelling reason to stay longer. Around eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave now, and they’re the ones we’re trying to help. If they say leave, then we can’t be blamed if things go wrong. We could still help them later, and at least we’d be the good guys, even if we never are in their eyes.",
            "Yes, I agree that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, but also the specific fields and industries you're involved in. Women, for instance, often face issues like the \"glass ceiling,\" where they can't be promoted to certain positions because of societal expectations. Men also face stereotyping, like being devalued in fields like fashion or being expected to be the primary breadwinners. Change is slow, but it's happening. It's essential to promote positive examples gradually rather than forcing change. Additionally, discrimination isn't just about gender; it can also be based on background, like coming from a rural area or having less than perfect grammar.",
            "The person is explaining that while marijuana has been decriminalized, not legalized, which means it's treated more like a traffic ticket rather than a criminal offense. This change in classification can have long-term consequences like job interview difficulties, similar to the worst impacts of a drug charge. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that arresting and processing individuals for possession is costly for municipalities. In places like Denver, where societal views are more liberal, this approach is acceptable and has freed up funds for public education, social programs, and assistance for marginalized groups. However, the speaker feels that legalization would make marijuana too widely available, potentially leading to more smoking in public and possibly more impaired driving, which might be socially unacceptable. Alcohol, while having more immediate effects on motor skills, might have a more adverse overall impact on lifestyle compared to marijuana, though individual reactions can vary greatly.",
            "I'd lean towards yes when considering the concept. While many of the practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which is valuable, it's crucial to also be flexible and adaptable to change. For instance, many Catholics strictly follow weekly church attendance and adhere to precise rituals. However, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church is judgmental of those who don't follow these guidelines to the letter, even those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents' marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church because my father was an Episcopalian, which seems inconsistent with their teachings on love and acceptance. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily prevent issues like pedophilia, as the problem seems to stem from a different area. I believe priests with or without spouses could potentially commit these acts, and thus, this change wouldn't likely prevent such incidents.",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. It's tricky because it involves balancing the separation of church and state and defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure if marriage should be defined by the government like it's a sacrament, as some people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment just because they were baptized. So, if someone is married, I think it should be treated like a civil union because that's essentially what it is - two people united together. Gay marriage, for instance, would simply be two people forming a civil union. I believe that if all states can agree on a logical framework, they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's not a significant enough cause to amend the constitution. It's simply not important enough to define marriage or ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my feelings about homosexuality are a bit complex. Although I have many gay friends and I don't fully support that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather decided by each state individually. Just like many states are democratic and many are republican, it makes sense for each state to decide on its own stance on gay marriage. Living in a state that supports a certain position is a reflection of your own choice, so it's not right for me to disagree with that state's decision. Moreover, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion. I don't think President Bush should impose his views on the entire country regarding gay marriage. He should not be the one to decide how each state should run its own affairs, as he won't be in office forever. If a future democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a back-and-forth situation. Ultimately, it should be up to each individual state to make that decision, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences, not the president.",

            "Initially, I was all for going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much damage as they did to us. However, I believe that the emotional response overshadowed long-term planning and preparedness. We were ill-equipped and lacked a clear strategy. I now believe the war backfired and wasn't effective. I originally supported it, but now I'm against it. I think the people there are so focused on fighting each other that they can't focus on us. I've lost interest in their internal affairs due to 9/11. I don't think we can change those people as they continuously fight amongst themselves. We were unprepared and didn't understand the culture of war there. We were driven by revenge and public sentiment. President Bush acted under pressure, but I understand why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't let them get away with their actions. However, we needed a better plan. There was a lack of unity and clarity in our goals. The situation has dragged on too long with insufficient progress. Staying there won't make a difference, and it's harming us more than helping. I think we should withdraw."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes.\nThey seem to be losing members, possibly because they are not inclusive of diverse viewpoints, such as those related to LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and birth control. While their strong stances on these issues are a part of their identity, some of their views can feel outdated. If they were to adopt more modern perspectives, they might retain more of their following. Many people are turning away from the Church due to these reasons. For instance, those who support abortion or LGBTQ+ rights may feel unwelcome in a community that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow married priests or female priests, but I'm not sure if this would have prevented the loss of members. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I believe they could also have a family life and still serve their duties.",
            "I personally don't have an issue with gay marriage. I believe that people's sexual orientation is not a conscious choice, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for it. I can't understand why some people think that a man and a woman can get married while two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem right to me. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do feel it's wrong to say that. I think it's not a choice, like being born with certain traits. I don't think it's the federal government's place to decide this. It's not a legal or moral issue that should concern them. It's just a personal choice, and I don't think the government should interfere with that. In my opinion, gay people shouldn't be treated differently, as their orientation is a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because there is no compelling reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to traditional families, but I think the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships are too vast to consider them the same. It's like two sides of the same coin, but fundamentally different. Moreover, there are numerous civil rights advantages that come with legal marriage, such as property rights, healthcare provisions, and next-of-kin benefits. The idea that a same-sex partner cannot be present in a hospital if one is ill or cannot visit due to not being technically considered family is quite unfair, especially when considering a lifelong commitment. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship success rates and satisfaction levels compared to heterosexual couples. The main concern is the lack of understanding about the nature of same-sex relationships – it's not about church weddings, but rather legal recognition. Legalizing same-sex marriage would be akin to segregation, as it's about ensuring the same legal rights and protections for all couples. Moreover, the concerns about gay couples' children and their integration into society are new and complex, but I believe the focus should be on how children are treated in society, not on their parents' sexual orientation. Lastly, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide and amend the constitution to reflect this change. President Bush's stance on same-sex marriage is largely driven by his religious beliefs, which I believe should not dictate government policies. The moral arguments against same-sex marriage are subjective and vary from person to person, and it's unethical to embrace one religious group's morality while ignoring others. Furthermore, many people's opposition to same-sex marriage stems from unfounded beliefs about homosexuality being a result of trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by scientific research. It's crucial to base our opinions on facts and data from reputable institutions, rather than popular culture or religious beliefs.",
            "During my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for making it widely available to the public, I do believe it should be considered for medicinal uses. After all, many controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in healthcare due to their benefits, not because they're legal. I think we should embrace the potential benefits of marijuana, especially for medical purposes. While I acknowledge the potential for abuse, I believe it's not as severe as with some other substances. If we address the stigma surrounding marijuana, people might use it responsibly, perhaps even for medical usage.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, dressed in cute outfits and matching accessories. Now, they offer a youth mass that’s 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, even wearing beach clothes on summer weekends. While I don't know the church's politics, I've noticed a general shift towards a more casual atmosphere, even in morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests could have prevented the issue, as pedophilia is likely genetic and not something that can be stopped through marriage. The church may have been aware of some cases and tried to cover them up, but I don't think they could have prevented all instances.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but considering the collective shock and trauma from the September 11th attacks, many of us were still processing it when we went into Iraq under the pretense of a connection to Al-Qaeda and the attacks, along with the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Bush administration manipulated these claims to justify their actions, which were later revealed to be false. This has always bothered me deeply, and the Iraq War continues to infuriate me.\n\nThe Bush administration deceived the American people openly and has yet to acknowledge this lie. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case before the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider this a grave offense, almost an impeachable offense. The administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to undermine it since September 11th. I think the younger Bush came into office with a desire for vengeance against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father’s administration, and a goal to secure additional energy resources, which is quite underhanded.\n\nI believe the current situation has dragged on too long, and withdrawing now could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The alternative being considered, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may also create long-term issues due to Iraq's sovereignty and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and the political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control. I can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I have a difficult time discussing the ongoing conflict in Iraq. I think it's pointless, as it was never officially declared a war, and I believe our involvement is largely driven by a desire to demonstrate our power or secure resources like oil. While I understand the initial reasoning behind the invasion, I don't think it's productive to remain in Iraq indefinitely, as it's causing more harm than good. I worry that our presence fuels ongoing violence and instability, and it's unclear whether our efforts to impose democracy will ultimately be successful. I also feel that our involvement prolongs the conflict and could exacerbate tensions between the different factions within Iraq. It's a complex issue, and I struggle to find a clear solution.",
            "I strongly believe it's not appropriate for it to be made legal or for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which suggests that the decision should rest with the churches. Attempting to enforce any control over this issue would defy what is already written in the constitution. I feel that those trying to make it illegal are imposing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the constitution and promoting religious tolerance in the US. I don't think making an amendment about it is right or necessary, as it goes against what is already established. Furthermore, such an amendment would be one of the few that restrict people's rights, not the government's. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be based on his personal Catholic beliefs, which isn't a valid reason. I believe the decision should be made by the churches, not the government, and there's no compelling reason for an amendment except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "I believe the U.S. government was not entirely truthful about the reasons for invading Iraq, attempting to tie the war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to capitalize on the public's outrage. The invasion began in 2003, but I was against it, especially as a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq, like the Vietnam War, has led to a significant loss of American lives, and the government's handling of the aftermath has been inadequate. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to install a democratic one, similar to the Vietnam War efforts against communism. However, I think the government underestimated the challenges and the time needed for implementing a new government. The US government also didn't plan for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. Now, almost three years later, we're still in Iraq, training Iraqi troops and police, and many American soldiers are still dying. I believe the government should have been better prepared. In the 2004 election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to complete what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult, given the high number of American casualties. The original reason for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic nation, but the U.S. hasn't applied this principle to other countries. I think the oil issue and the search for weapons of mass destruction were significant factors in the decision. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, while North Korea, which has them, hasn't been targeted. I hope the war ends soon and peace comes to Iraq, but it's unlikely to happen soon.",
            "I support same-sex marriage and always have. I believe it's a matter of personal preference and, increasingly, is being backed by scientific evidence that suggests it's biological rather than societal, which makes it unfair to deny rights based on something people can't control. I find it inhumane to restrict their rights. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should intervene in this personal matter; it's between individuals and their families, not the government. In my neighborhood, I know of several gay couples who are not married but function the same as any other family. I think it's absurd for the government to dictate marriage based on personal beliefs. I've heard and read that being gay could be influenced by brain chemistry, not societal factors. Other than that, marriage is something that individuals can choose freely, regardless of who they are. The same applies to same-sex couples; it should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "Once something is posted online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've encountered this issue firsthand. When you share information on the internet, it can influence people's perceptions of you. If you discuss harmful topics like explosions or shootings, someone might react. The internet is accessible to everyone, and even if it's not the school receiving the message, someone might bring it to their attention. Schools can't ignore potential threats; they must take action. However, not everything online should be taken seriously, as some people may joke about such things. Recently, a situation arose where someone overheard a comment at school that led to concern when a friend checked the person's Facebook. The comment, intended as a joke, became serious. When posting online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your information. School officials shouldn't friend students on social media or monitor personal conversations. However, if information is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. I don't believe teachers should friend students on platforms like Facebook, and I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. It's not appropriate for me to monitor their online activities.",
            "The war has been dragging on far too long, and I believe that while the initial goal was noble—restoring democracy in another country—we have since lost sight of that aim. Our actions now seem more about maintaining our global superpower status than the original purpose. The motivations behind the war might have been questionable, given previous conflicts involving Saddam Hussein and George Bush's father. If our goal was to bring democracy to an oppressive regime, then it was a valid cause. However, I think the war has become about prolonging our involvement rather than achieving a clear victory. It has now lasted far too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over and handle their own affairs. We've been spending billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and citizens at home suffer. Our resources would be better spent on addressing domestic issues like poverty, improving infrastructure, and healthcare. The endless war is a drain on our country and has lost its initial purpose.",

            "Well, um, we’ve got this one more thing I need to discuss about the Iraq War. I feel awkward bringing it up, like I don’t want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start. Yet, it’s not really relevant anymore because the global consensus was that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong. Polls show that around seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, including most Iraqis and many U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should leave within the year. It’s been a disaster from the start, and pulling out would also be chaotic. The cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East is too vast for any administration to understand. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but the pros and cons of invading should have been weighed before the disaster began. It’s like we stepped into a quicksand. I can’t think of a good reason to stay. If we decide to leave gradually over the course of a year or so, that’s fine. But, I don’t see a compelling reason to stay longer. Around eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave now, and they’re the ones we’re trying to help. If they say leave, then we can’t be blamed if things go wrong. We could still help them later, and at least we’d be the good guys, even if we never are in their eyes.",
            "Yes, I agree that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, but also the specific fields and industries you're involved in. Women, for instance, often face issues like the \"glass ceiling,\" where they can't be promoted to certain positions because of societal expectations. Men also face stereotyping, like being devalued in fields like fashion or being expected to be the primary breadwinners. Change is slow, but it's happening. It's essential to promote positive examples gradually rather than forcing change. Additionally, discrimination isn't just about gender; it can also be based on background, like coming from a rural area or having less than perfect grammar.",
            "The person is explaining that while marijuana has been decriminalized, not legalized, which means it's treated more like a traffic ticket rather than a criminal offense. This change in classification can have long-term consequences like job interview difficulties, similar to the worst impacts of a drug charge. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that arresting and processing individuals for possession is costly for municipalities. In places like Denver, where societal views are more liberal, this approach is acceptable and has freed up funds for public education, social programs, and assistance for marginalized groups. However, the speaker feels that legalization would make marijuana too widely available, potentially leading to more smoking in public and possibly more impaired driving, which might be socially unacceptable. Alcohol, while having more immediate effects on motor skills, might have a more adverse overall impact on lifestyle compared to marijuana, though individual reactions can vary greatly.",
            "I'd lean towards yes when considering the concept. While many of the practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which is valuable, it's crucial to also be flexible and adaptable to change. For instance, many Catholics strictly follow weekly church attendance and adhere to precise rituals. However, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church is judgmental of those who don't follow these guidelines to the letter, even those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents' marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church because my father was an Episcopalian, which seems inconsistent with their teachings on love and acceptance. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily prevent issues like pedophilia, as the problem seems to stem from a different area. I believe priests with or without spouses could potentially commit these acts, and thus, this change wouldn't likely prevent such incidents.",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. It's tricky because it involves balancing the separation of church and state and defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure if marriage should be defined by the government like it's a sacrament, as some people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment just because they were baptized. So, if someone is married, I think it should be treated like a civil union because that's essentially what it is - two people united together. Gay marriage, for instance, would simply be two people forming a civil union. I believe that if all states can agree on a logical framework, they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's not a significant enough cause to amend the constitution. It's simply not important enough to define marriage or ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my feelings about homosexuality are a bit complex. Although I have many gay friends and I don't fully support that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather decided by each state individually. Just like many states are democratic and many are republican, it makes sense for each state to decide on its own stance on gay marriage. Living in a state that supports a certain position is a reflection of your own choice, so it's not right for me to disagree with that state's decision. Moreover, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion. I don't think President Bush should impose his views on the entire country regarding gay marriage. He should not be the one to decide how each state should run its own affairs, as he won't be in office forever. If a future democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a back-and-forth situation. Ultimately, it should be up to each individual state to make that decision, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "Here's the paraphrased version:\n\nUm\nNo, I don't think so\nUm\nLet's see, I\nThe way I understand it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat's mainly to post publicly\nFor others to see\nUm\nWhatever your goal is\nAnd\nNow, if you post something on the internet\nUm\nYou have to realize that people will see it\nWhether it's school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though school officials seeing that\nThey had the right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren't doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed it\nUh\nThrough their own means\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat's perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are engaging in activities they shouldn't be doing\nThey go on there specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut  Um\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nLives or make the school a safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt’s public\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nI’m\nUh\nWorried to post anything online\nUm\nLike if I have something not good to say about someone I don’t ever post it online\nBecause\nI’m afraid someone might find it\nAnd you know\nEverything nowadays comes back to bite you\nUm\nLike  if you do something while you’re in college and you become important later on they’ll find an email you sent and use it against you\nAnd once it is on the internet it’s always there\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nIt wasn’t an invasion of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that's basically all I’ve been saying was it’s public\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before, I don’t think they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to make the school a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock-downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drills\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was in case people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that's basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was all for going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much damage as they did to us. However, I believe that the emotional response overshadowed long-term planning and preparedness. We were ill-equipped and lacked a clear strategy. I now believe the war backfired and wasn't effective. I originally supported it, but now I'm against it. I think the people there are so focused on fighting each other that they can't focus on us. I've lost interest in their internal affairs due to 9/11. I don't think we can change those people as they continuously fight amongst themselves. We were unprepared and didn't understand the culture of war there. We were driven by revenge and public sentiment. President Bush acted under pressure, but I understand why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't let them get away with their actions. However, we needed a better plan. There was a lack of unity and clarity in our goals. The situation has dragged on too long with insufficient progress. Staying there won't make a difference, and it's harming us more than helping. I think we should withdraw."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes.\nThey seem to be losing members, possibly because they are not inclusive of diverse viewpoints, such as those related to LGBTQ+ rights, abortion, and birth control. While their strong stances on these issues are a part of their identity, some of their views can feel outdated. If they were to adopt more modern perspectives, they might retain more of their following. Many people are turning away from the Church due to these reasons. For instance, those who support abortion or LGBTQ+ rights may feel unwelcome in a community that views these as wrong. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow married priests or female priests, but I'm not sure if this would have prevented the loss of members. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I believe they could also have a family life and still serve their duties.",
            "I personally don't have an issue with gay marriage. I believe that people's sexual orientation is not a conscious choice, so it's unfair to hold them responsible for it. I can't understand why some people think that a man and a woman can get married while two people of the same sex can't. It doesn't seem right to me. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do feel it's wrong to say that. I think it's not a choice, like being born with certain traits. I don't think it's the federal government's place to decide this. It's not a legal or moral issue that should concern them. It's just a personal choice, and I don't think the government should interfere with that. In my opinion, gay people shouldn't be treated differently, as their orientation is a natural part of who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for it.",
            "I believe that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because there is no compelling reason not to. Many people think that gay couples pose a threat to traditional families, but I think the differences between same-sex and opposite-sex relationships are too vast to consider them the same. It's like two sides of the same coin, but fundamentally different. Moreover, there are numerous civil rights advantages that come with legal marriage, such as property rights, healthcare provisions, and next-of-kin benefits. The idea that a same-sex partner cannot be present in a hospital if one is ill or cannot visit due to not being technically considered family is quite unfair, especially when considering a lifelong commitment. Scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship success rates and satisfaction levels compared to heterosexual couples. The main concern is the lack of understanding about the nature of same-sex relationships – it's not about church weddings, but rather legal recognition. Legalizing same-sex marriage would be akin to segregation, as it's about ensuring the same legal rights and protections for all couples. Moreover, the concerns about gay couples' children and their integration into society are new and complex, but I believe the focus should be on how children are treated in society, not on their parents' sexual orientation. Lastly, I think the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage nationwide and amend the constitution to reflect this change. President Bush's stance on same-sex marriage is largely driven by his religious beliefs, which I believe should not dictate government policies. The moral arguments against same-sex marriage are subjective and vary from person to person, and it's unethical to embrace one religious group's morality while ignoring others. Furthermore, many people's opposition to same-sex marriage stems from unfounded beliefs about homosexuality being a result of trauma or personality defects, which have been debunked by scientific research. It's crucial to base our opinions on facts and data from reputable institutions, rather than popular culture or religious beliefs.",
            "During my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it lacks medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for making it widely available to the public, I do believe it should be considered for medicinal uses. After all, many controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in healthcare due to their benefits, not because they're legal. I think we should embrace the potential benefits of marijuana, especially for medical purposes. While I acknowledge the potential for abuse, I believe it's not as severe as with some other substances. If we address the stigma surrounding marijuana, people might use it responsibly, perhaps even for medical usage.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than it once was. Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, dressed in cute outfits and matching accessories. Now, they offer a youth mass that’s 30 minutes long, and people dress more casually, even wearing beach clothes on summer weekends. While I don't know the church's politics, I've noticed a general shift towards a more casual atmosphere, even in morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't think allowing female priests or married priests could have prevented the issue, as pedophilia is likely genetic and not something that can be stopped through marriage. The church may have been aware of some cases and tried to cover them up, but I don't think they could have prevented all instances.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the premise, but considering the collective shock and trauma from the September 11th attacks, many of us were still processing it when we went into Iraq under the pretense of a connection to Al-Qaeda and the attacks, along with the supposed presence of weapons of mass destruction. I believe the Bush administration manipulated these claims to justify their actions, which were later revealed to be false. This has always bothered me deeply, and the Iraq War continues to infuriate me.\n\nThe Bush administration deceived the American people openly and has yet to acknowledge this lie. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case before the UN, has since admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. I consider this a grave offense, almost an impeachable offense. The administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to undermine it since September 11th. I think the younger Bush came into office with a desire for vengeance against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father’s administration, and a goal to secure additional energy resources, which is quite underhanded.\n\nI believe the current situation has dragged on too long, and withdrawing now could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The alternative being considered, a coalition of neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may also create long-term issues due to Iraq's sovereignty and the ineffective interim government. The Parliament seems ineffective, and the political process is fraught with friction, with radical elements vying for control. I can't articulate these thoughts in polite company.",
            "I have a difficult time discussing the ongoing conflict in Iraq. I think it's pointless, as it was never officially declared a war, and I believe our involvement is largely driven by a desire to demonstrate our power or secure resources like oil. While I understand the initial reasoning behind the invasion, I don't think it's productive to remain in Iraq indefinitely, as it's causing more harm than good. I worry that our presence fuels ongoing violence and instability, and it's unclear whether our efforts to impose democracy will ultimately be successful. I also feel that our involvement prolongs the conflict and could exacerbate tensions between the different factions within Iraq. It's a complex issue, and I struggle to find a clear solution.",
            "I strongly believe it's not appropriate for it to be made legal or for a state to declare it as such. The constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, which suggests that the decision should rest with the churches. Attempting to enforce any control over this issue would defy what is already written in the constitution. I feel that those trying to make it illegal are imposing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don't think it's up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal or legal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental principle of the constitution and promoting religious tolerance in the US. I don't think making an amendment about it is right or necessary, as it goes against what is already established. Furthermore, such an amendment would be one of the few that restrict people's rights, not the government's. I don't believe the federal government or any government should be involved in this matter. The president's push for this amendment seems to be based on his personal Catholic beliefs, which isn't a valid reason. I believe the decision should be made by the churches, not the government, and there's no compelling reason for an amendment except for personal views. It might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "I believe the U.S. government was not entirely truthful about the reasons for invading Iraq, attempting to tie the war to the 9/11 terrorist attacks to capitalize on the public's outrage. The invasion began in 2003, but I was against it, especially as a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq, like the Vietnam War, has led to a significant loss of American lives, and the government's handling of the aftermath has been inadequate. The U.S. removed the Iraqi government and tried to install a democratic one, similar to the Vietnam War efforts against communism. However, I think the government underestimated the challenges and the time needed for implementing a new government. The US government also didn't plan for the aftermath and the chaos that would ensue. Now, almost three years later, we're still in Iraq, training Iraqi troops and police, and many American soldiers are still dying. I believe the government should have been better prepared. In the 2004 election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to complete what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult, given the high number of American casualties. The original reason for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic nation, but the U.S. hasn't applied this principle to other countries. I think the oil issue and the search for weapons of mass destruction were significant factors in the decision. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, while North Korea, which has them, hasn't been targeted. I hope the war ends soon and peace comes to Iraq, but it's unlikely to happen soon.",
            "I support same-sex marriage and always have. I believe it's a matter of personal preference and, increasingly, is being backed by scientific evidence that suggests it's biological rather than societal, which makes it unfair to deny rights based on something people can't control. I find it inhumane to restrict their rights. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should intervene in this personal matter; it's between individuals and their families, not the government. In my neighborhood, I know of several gay couples who are not married but function the same as any other family. I think it's absurd for the government to dictate marriage based on personal beliefs. I've heard and read that being gay could be influenced by brain chemistry, not societal factors. Other than that, marriage is something that individuals can choose freely, regardless of who they are. The same applies to same-sex couples; it should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "Once something is posted online, it becomes public. As an R.A., I've encountered this issue firsthand. When you share information on the internet, it can influence people's perceptions of you. If you discuss harmful topics like explosions or shootings, someone might react. The internet is accessible to everyone, and even if it's not the school receiving the message, someone might bring it to their attention. Schools can't ignore potential threats; they must take action. However, not everything online should be taken seriously, as some people may joke about such things. Recently, a situation arose where someone overheard a comment at school that led to concern when a friend checked the person's Facebook. The comment, intended as a joke, became serious. When posting online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your information. School officials shouldn't friend students on social media or monitor personal conversations. However, if information is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. I don't believe teachers should friend students on platforms like Facebook, and I wouldn't friend my residents for similar reasons. It's not appropriate for me to monitor their online activities.",
            "The war has been dragging on far too long, and I believe that while the initial goal was noble—restoring democracy in another country—we have since lost sight of that aim. Our actions now seem more about maintaining our global superpower status than the original purpose. The motivations behind the war might have been questionable, given previous conflicts involving Saddam Hussein and George Bush's father. If our goal was to bring democracy to an oppressive regime, then it was a valid cause. However, I think the war has become about prolonging our involvement rather than achieving a clear victory. It has now lasted far too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over and handle their own affairs. We've been spending billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and citizens at home suffer. Our resources would be better spent on addressing domestic issues like poverty, improving infrastructure, and healthcare. The endless war is a drain on our country and has lost its initial purpose.",

            "Well, um, we’ve got this one more thing I need to discuss about the Iraq War. I feel awkward bringing it up, like I don’t want to be one of those people who says they were against it from the start. Yet, it’s not really relevant anymore because the global consensus was that it was a bad idea, except for within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong. Polls show that around seventy-five to eighty percent of the world, including most Iraqis and many U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should leave within the year. It’s been a disaster from the start, and pulling out would also be chaotic. The cultural gap between the U.S. and the Middle East is too vast for any administration to understand. Sure, Saddam was a bad guy, but the pros and cons of invading should have been weighed before the disaster began. It’s like we stepped into a quicksand. I can’t think of a good reason to stay. If we decide to leave gradually over the course of a year or so, that’s fine. But, I don’t see a compelling reason to stay longer. Around eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave now, and they’re the ones we’re trying to help. If they say leave, then we can’t be blamed if things go wrong. We could still help them later, and at least we’d be the good guys, even if we never are in their eyes.",
            "Yes, I agree that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It's not just about women, but also the specific fields and industries you're involved in. Women, for instance, often face issues like the \"glass ceiling,\" where they can't be promoted to certain positions because of societal expectations. Men also face stereotyping, like being devalued in fields like fashion or being expected to be the primary breadwinners. Change is slow, but it's happening. It's essential to promote positive examples gradually rather than forcing change. Additionally, discrimination isn't just about gender; it can also be based on background, like coming from a rural area or having less than perfect grammar.",
            "The person is explaining that while marijuana has been decriminalized, not legalized, which means it's treated more like a traffic ticket rather than a criminal offense. This change in classification can have long-term consequences like job interview difficulties, similar to the worst impacts of a drug charge. Despite this, the speaker acknowledges that arresting and processing individuals for possession is costly for municipalities. In places like Denver, where societal views are more liberal, this approach is acceptable and has freed up funds for public education, social programs, and assistance for marginalized groups. However, the speaker feels that legalization would make marijuana too widely available, potentially leading to more smoking in public and possibly more impaired driving, which might be socially unacceptable. Alcohol, while having more immediate effects on motor skills, might have a more adverse overall impact on lifestyle compared to marijuana, though individual reactions can vary greatly.",
            "I'd lean towards yes when considering the concept. While many of the practices are deeply rooted in tradition, which is valuable, it's crucial to also be flexible and adaptable to change. For instance, many Catholics strictly follow weekly church attendance and adhere to precise rituals. However, this sometimes leads to a perception that the Church is judgmental of those who don't follow these guidelines to the letter, even those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents' marriage was not recognized by the Catholic Church because my father was an Episcopalian, which seems inconsistent with their teachings on love and acceptance. While I believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial, I don't think it would necessarily prevent issues like pedophilia, as the problem seems to stem from a different area. I believe priests with or without spouses could potentially commit these acts, and thus, this change wouldn't likely prevent such incidents.",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say who's right or wrong. However, I do think it's one of the most challenging topics we're facing today. It's tricky because it involves balancing the separation of church and state and defining marriage without offending anyone. I'm not sure if marriage should be defined by the government like it's a sacrament, as some people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment just because they were baptized. So, if someone is married, I think it should be treated like a civil union because that's essentially what it is - two people united together. Gay marriage, for instance, would simply be two people forming a civil union. I believe that if all states can agree on a logical framework, they should push for it to become federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage is ridiculous. It's not a significant enough cause to amend the constitution. It's simply not important enough to define marriage or ban gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, so my feelings about homosexuality are a bit complex. Although I have many gay friends and I don't fully support that lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather decided by each state individually. Just like many states are democratic and many are republican, it makes sense for each state to decide on its own stance on gay marriage. Living in a state that supports a certain position is a reflection of your own choice, so it's not right for me to disagree with that state's decision. Moreover, I believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think gay marriage should be legalized based on each state's discretion. I don't think President Bush should impose his views on the entire country regarding gay marriage. He should not be the one to decide how each state should run its own affairs, as he won't be in office forever. If a future democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be a back-and-forth situation. Ultimately, it should be up to each individual state to make that decision, as they are the ones who will live with the consequences, not the president.",

            "Initially, I was all for going to war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I wanted to cause as much damage as they did to us. However, I believe that the emotional response overshadowed long-term planning and preparedness. We were ill-equipped and lacked a clear strategy. I now believe the war backfired and wasn't effective. I originally supported it, but now I'm against it. I think the people there are so focused on fighting each other that they can't focus on us. I've lost interest in their internal affairs due to 9/11. I don't think we can change those people as they continuously fight amongst themselves. We were unprepared and didn't understand the culture of war there. We were driven by revenge and public sentiment. President Bush acted under pressure, but I understand why he declared war on Iraq. We couldn't let them get away with their actions. However, we needed a better plan. There was a lack of unity and clarity in our goals. The situation has dragged on too long with insufficient progress. Staying there won't make a difference, and it's harming us more than helping. I think we should withdraw."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from certain changes in its views. There has been discussion about the Church losing some of its followers, which I attribute to its stance on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While the Church has strong views on these topics, they can sometimes be considered outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might be able to retain its following. Some people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to disagreements over its stances on these issues. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might not feel comfortable in a community that considers these practices wrong. While I don't see any reason why women couldn't be priests or priests couldn't be married, I'm not certain if these changes would have prevented the Church's current challenges.",
            "In my opinion, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I don't think it's something that's chosen; it's more of an inherent part of who someone is. Therefore, I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can get married but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. I don't think it's a choice, like being straight is not a choice either. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue or a moral concern. It's just how people are born, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There's no compelling reason to prevent it. Many opponents claim that gay couples threaten the traditional heterosexual family, but these relationships are unique and multifaceted, and cannot be equated to heterosexual ones. They are essentially two sides of the same coin, with the same rights and responsibilities. For instance, without legal recognition, a gay partner can't visit or be present when their partner is ill, or make decisions about their partner's healthcare. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe core issue here is that same-sex couples are not seeking religious marriage ceremonies, but simply legal marriage certificates. If civil unions are allowed, why not marriage? It's like having separate but unequal laws; it's not logical to deny one group the same rights and benefits. People also often worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Parenting skills are the same regardless of sexual orientation. Children of gay couples can and do thrive in their communities just like children of straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in all states. I think the current amendment should be reversed. However, President Bush's stance on this issue is strongly influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against gay marriage are rooted in morality, which is subjective and varies among individuals. It's hypocritical for the government to support certain religious beliefs while ignoring others, especially considering recent controversies around religious influence in political decisions.\n\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or trauma, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. Ignoring the findings of reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association and instead relying on personal beliefs and popular opinions can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. To clarify, the legality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for general public access, I believe it can have medicinal uses. Illegal doesn't mean beneficial; it simply isn't beneficial. Additionally, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in hospitals because they provide benefits when used appropriately. I don't see a significant difference between marijuana and these drugs, and I think we should consider its potential benefits. I suggest legalizing it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. People's negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. Once we remove this stigma, people can potentially use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. However, I don't see the need to compare it to heroin or cocaine, as they are entirely different substances.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's less strict now compared to how it used to be. When I was younger, I would go to church every Sunday and always wear cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. Now, they have a teen mass that only lasts 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Even in the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. The church I know has seen the biggest changes in that aspect. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's the main thing I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe some people are inherently attracted to children, regardless of their marital status. The church can't change that. It's more about the individual person's genetics and upbringing. If they knowingly covered up cases, they're at fault, but not all cases were known. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but I believe that the September 11th attacks were still fresh in everyone's minds, which may have led to the decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. This bothers me greatly and the Iraq war really agitates me.\n\nI feel that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced at the time. This, to me, constitutes a dereliction of duty and should be grounds for impeachment. I think the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution and has tried to undermine it since 9/11. The administration entered office with a goal to go to war.\n\nThere have been allegations that George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and there may have been a desire to increase our energy supply, which is a rather underhanded motivation.\n\nI believe the war has gone on too long, but I'm concerned that pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The UN and the US are now considering a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. It could cause long-term problems, as Iraq's sovereignty is already an issue, and the interim government seems ineffective. News reports suggest the Parliament is not functioning well, and the Prime Minister lacks control. The political process is fraught with friction due to radical elements vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds a significant number of seats in the Parliament.",
            "I expressed some thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, I felt it was pointless because it wasn't a declared war, and it seemed like a revenge mission against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not well-informed about the war, but I believe our presence there is to build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's justified to stay, as it's causing unrest and may lead to long-term issues. The creation of democracy can't happen overnight, and leaving would result in anger and having to start over. It's a challenging topic for me, as I don't know much about it. I think the war should continue, but it's hard to call it a war as it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I feel Bush's actions are making him look bad. I believe the war could be seen as a meaningless conflict, much like the Vietnam War. It's difficult to say if I want the war to continue, as there are families with relatives serving in Iraq, but staying may cause more harm in the long run. The culture clash could lead to increased hatred towards the U.S. and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda. I think this war will continue for many years. That's about it.",
            "I genuinely don't feel that it's appropriate for a state to legalize or outlaw it. I believe this decision should be left to the churches, as the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state clearly states. Attempting to impose any authority on this matter would be a defiance of the Constitution. I think those advocating for its illegality are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it’s the government's place to decide what the churches can and cannot legalize. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution and promotes religious tolerance. I don't think an amendment on this matter is necessary or right, as it would go against what's already established in the Constitution and could potentially restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be solely based on his personal Catholic beliefs, demonstrating a preference for one religion over others. Therefore, I believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the government. There doesn't seem to be any substantial reason for an amendment banning it, and it could even have a positive impact on society.",
            "I believe the government was not entirely honest with Americans about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. The invasion was made to appear connected to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but that wasn't the case. The government exploited the public's outrage to gain support for the war. I was against the war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq mirrors many aspects of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from the mistakes made there. The loss of American lives was immense, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. The US removed the Iraqi government and attempted to establish a democratic one, similar to what was done in Vietnam. However, the process was long and difficult, and the government underestimated the challenges. I feel the US government misled the American people into believing the war would be short and successful. Democracy takes time to establish and stabilize, as it did in the US itself. I also question why Iraq was the only country targeted for democracy when other countries with similar issues were not. The main reason seems to be access to oil. The claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was not supported by evidence, while countries like North Korea, which do have such weapons, were not targeted. I hope the war ends soon, but I expect it will not.",
            "I am in favor of same-sex marriage. I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice and that it's increasingly being recognized as a biological inclination rather than a societal influence. Taking away rights due to something that's out of one's control is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should be involved in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples who function just like any other family. I think it's absurd for Bush to try and dictate marriage based on his personal interpretations. I've read that being gay might be influenced by biological factors rather than societal ones. Additionally, same-sex couples shouldn't face the same level of scrutiny and public attention as opposite-sex couples. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public and accessible to anyone. As an example, I, as a teacher, have dealt with this issue before. When you put information out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you discuss topics like violence or harmful actions, someone might interpret your posts in a serious way. The internet is seen by everyone, including friends on social platforms like Myspace. If something is posted, it can reach the school, which then has to act upon it to ensure safety. However, you can't always know what to take seriously, as some people might post things as jokes. For instance, a student might have written something about a sociology experiment gone wrong, which could also be interpreted as a serious threat. When you post something online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret your posts. While school officials shouldn't friend students on social media, if a threat is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't monitor private communications, but if something is reported, they have to act. Similarly, I wouldn't friend my students on social media to avoid seeing inappropriate content.",
            "The conflict appears to have lasted much longer than necessary. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, it seems that we've strayed from that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're continuing the war for the sake of proving our power, rather than for any genuine reason.\n\nThe initial push had a clear message, but the prolonged duration is now excessive. The war has been going on for over a year, possibly even years. While the intention to bring democracy to a tyrannized country was valid, I believe our cause has been diluted and misguided. It seems we're now engaged in a war for the sake of waging war, rather than achieving a clear goal.\n\nWe've stretched our resources thin, spending billions of dollars on this conflict. We have our own domestic issues to address, such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These are areas where our money could be much better spent.

You might need to\nKnow, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it.\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good,\nThat someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost,\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough,\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that,\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think,\nO let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\nUm\nI mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles,\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles\nAnd just happened to see that,\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know,\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\nSo, I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell,\nLike,\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook,\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me,\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\nUm,\nThis man who just,\nHe was just trying to prove how easy it is to get information,\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away,\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger,\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him,\nAnd I mean,\nPersonally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone,\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me,\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests,\nThey know what you look like,\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\nWho your friends are,\nThey pretty much know a lot about you,\nAll sorts of photos,\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there,\nBut at the same time,\nThe whole point\nI think,\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends,\nI don't want to limit it too much,\nSo it's a tricky issue,\nBecause I only accept people I know,\nI mean you never know really,\nWho can look at what,\nSo\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school,\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school,\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange,\nLike I wasn't sure how,\nHow high school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue,\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",
            "Hmm\nUm\nWe're only going to discuss the Iraq War one more time\nUm\nI feel hypocritical talking about it\nI mean, I hate to seem like one of those people who say they were against it from the start\nUm\nI was, but it's not really relevant anymore\nBecause most people everywhere agree it was a bad idea, except within the administration who refuse to admit they were wrong\nUm\nLook at recent polls\nThey've done polls in the U.S., Iraq, and globally\nAnd about seventy-five to eighty percent of the world thinks it was a bad idea\nEighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of U.S. troops over there think it was a dumb idea and we should pull out within the year\nUm\nIt's been a disaster from the start\nIt was bad before we got there and pulling out now will be bad too\nThere's no easy way to handle anything involving the Middle East these days\nUm\nI think it's just a cultural clash between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states\nThe gap is too wide for any administration to understand and they want to impose democracy in an area where it doesn't fit\nUm\nSure, Saddam Hussein was a bad guy, but you have to consider the pros and cons before invading a country that will turn into a disaster\nJust like quicksand\nUm\nI don't even know what to say about it\nUm\nI don't see a reason to stay in there\nUm\nThe administration might have hopeful reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any legitimate ones\nUm\nIf they want to stay gradually over a year or more, I guess I wouldn't mind\nBut I don't see a reason why we shouldn't just leave now\nUm\nI read that eighty percent of Iraqis think we should be gone within the year and at least a quarter of them want us to leave immediately\nThese are the people we're supposed to be helping\nThey're telling us to leave\nUm\nMaybe they know best\nIf we ask them if we should leave and they say yes, then we can't be blamed if things go wrong\nUm\nAnd if we decide to help afterward, at least we'll be the good guys, sort of\nI mean, we'll never be the good guys in the Middle East, but it'll be better than where we are now\nUm\nYeah\nUh\nNo",
            "Yes, indeed, I believe that gender discrimination is still prevalent in the United States. It's not just women, though; discrimination can also occur within specific job fields. For example, women face the \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite their qualifications, they may not be promoted to higher positions because it's not customary for women to hold such roles. Similarly, men who stay at home to care for their children face societal disapproval, as society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they're straight, as they are perceived as not understanding women's fashion. I feel that gender discrimination exists across various industries and locations. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's crucial to continue promoting the qualities of those stereotyped against without being too forceful. In the meantime, we must recognize that people from different backgrounds can also face discrimination, whether due to their gender, job type, or where they grew from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This change reduced marijuana possession from a criminal offense to a minor infraction similar to getting a traffic ticket, where you receive a citation rather than experiencing arrest and other legal processes. When someone is cited for possessing marijuana, it can still negatively impact job prospects and other life aspects, as is the case with drug charges. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on law enforcement and the legal system, potentially saving money. However, some communities may be financially strained and philosophically opposed to decriminalizing marijuana. In places like Denver, with a more open and liberal mindset, decriminalization may be seen as a viable option to redirect resources into education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be widely available in public spaces, its legalization could lead to it being sold openly, like cigarettes, which could cause issues with public smoking and driving under the influence. Alcohol and marijuana both have adverse effects on individuals, but reactions vary greatly, and moderation is key.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause while many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition and it's good to maintain those roots, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. I believe that a lot of Catholics are very strict about following the weekly church attendance and doctrine, which can make those who don't adhere to these rules feel judged or unwelcome. For instance, my parents had different religious beliefs – my mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian – and they were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church due to my father's religion. This lack of tolerance for other religions feels hypocritical considering the Catholic teaching to love others. I feel that the Catholic Church often practices traditions that contradict their teachings due to their outdated nature. I don't believe that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent child molestation, as the issue is more about personal character than marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue. I can't definitively say whether one side is right or wrong because it's such a contentious topic. It's particularly tricky due to the sensitive balance between church and state and how to legally define marriage. I believe all civil unions should be treated the same, regardless of religious or personal beliefs. If a couple is married, I think the government should treat it as a civil union, rather than inquire about its religious significance. As for gay marriage, I think each state should come to a rational decision and push for nationwide recognition. However, amending the constitution to ban it is unreasonable; it's not a pressing enough issue to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian family, so my stance on homosexuality is somewhat complex. I have many gay friends, and while I don't entirely support the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue but rather something that should be decided individually by each state. Many states are democratic and will likely push for gay marriage, and it's important to respect their decisions since people choose to live there. I don't believe the president should impose their views on every state. I think the decision should be left up to individual states, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "I wouldn't say no, in fact. If you consider what Myspace is, it's essentially a platform where you can post things for the public to see. When you post something online, you have to be aware that many people, including school officials, might see it. Therefore, if school officials see it, they have the right to do so, especially if it's to prevent something like a school shooting. Even though they might be checking for things like students drinking or smoking, it's understandable if it helps to make the school safer. It's a public thing, and students should be aware of that. I'm not saying they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it leads them to make the school safer, then I think it's fine. Similarly, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy if it helps the school officials in their duty to keep students safe. I've discussed this with a teacher, and it's important for schools to ensure safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. So, while I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I do understand the concern about privacy. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Initially, I supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. However, I now believe that our response was driven primarily by emotion and a lack of long-term planning. We invaded Iraq unprepared and without a clear strategy. In retrospect, I think the war was a mistake. I'm now strongly against it. I don't believe our presence has done anything to deter further attacks. In fact, I think the internal conflicts in the region are preventing any real progress. I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel that they are capable of fighting each other but not with us. I believe we should have a better plan before entering a conflict. We were more focused on revenge than rational thinking. President Bush, driven by public opinion, declared war on Iraq, which I understand, but I think we could have handled it differently. The lack of unity and clear objectives in our mission hurt our cause. I don't believe we can or should try to change their culture. I think they'll continue to be the same. I don't see enough progress to justify our continued presence, and I believe their situation will deteriorate once we leave. We're only harming ourselves by staying there."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from certain changes in its views. There has been discussion about the Church losing some of its followers, which I attribute to its stance on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While the Church has strong views on these topics, they can sometimes be considered outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might be able to retain its following. Some people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to disagreements over its stances on these issues. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might not feel comfortable in a community that considers these practices wrong. While I don't see any reason why women couldn't be priests or priests couldn't be married, I'm not certain if these changes would have prevented the Church's current challenges.",
            "In my opinion, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I don't think it's something that's chosen; it's more of an inherent part of who someone is. Therefore, I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can get married but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. I don't think it's a choice, like being straight is not a choice either. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue or a moral concern. It's just how people are born, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There's no compelling reason to prevent it. Many opponents claim that gay couples threaten the traditional heterosexual family, but these relationships are unique and multifaceted, and cannot be equated to heterosexual ones. They are essentially two sides of the same coin, with the same rights and responsibilities. For instance, without legal recognition, a gay partner can't visit or be present when their partner is ill, or make decisions about their partner's healthcare. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe core issue here is that same-sex couples are not seeking religious marriage ceremonies, but simply legal marriage certificates. If civil unions are allowed, why not marriage? It's like having separate but unequal laws; it's not logical to deny one group the same rights and benefits. People also often worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Parenting skills are the same regardless of sexual orientation. Children of gay couples can and do thrive in their communities just like children of straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in all states. I think the current amendment should be reversed. However, President Bush's stance on this issue is strongly influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against gay marriage are rooted in morality, which is subjective and varies among individuals. It's hypocritical for the government to support certain religious beliefs while ignoring others, especially considering recent controversies around religious influence in political decisions.\n\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or trauma, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. Ignoring the findings of reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association and instead relying on personal beliefs and popular opinions can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. To clarify, the legality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for general public access, I believe it can have medicinal uses. Illegal doesn't mean beneficial; it simply isn't beneficial. Additionally, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in hospitals because they provide benefits when used appropriately. I don't see a significant difference between marijuana and these drugs, and I think we should consider its potential benefits. I suggest legalizing it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. People's negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. Once we remove this stigma, people can potentially use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. However, I don't see the need to compare it to heroin or cocaine, as they are entirely different substances.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's less strict now compared to how it used to be. When I was younger, I would go to church every Sunday and always wear cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. Now, they have a teen mass that only lasts 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Even in the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. The church I know has seen the biggest changes in that aspect. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's the main thing I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe some people are inherently attracted to children, regardless of their marital status. The church can't change that. It's more about the individual person's genetics and upbringing. If they knowingly covered up cases, they're at fault, but not all cases were known. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but I believe that the September 11th attacks were still fresh in everyone's minds, which may have led to the decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. This bothers me greatly and the Iraq war really agitates me.\n\nI feel that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced at the time. This, to me, constitutes a dereliction of duty and should be grounds for impeachment. I think the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution and has tried to undermine it since 9/11. The administration entered office with a goal to go to war.\n\nThere have been allegations that George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and there may have been a desire to increase our energy supply, which is a rather underhanded motivation.\n\nI believe the war has gone on too long, but I'm concerned that pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The UN and the US are now considering a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. It could cause long-term problems, as Iraq's sovereignty is already an issue, and the interim government seems ineffective. News reports suggest the Parliament is not functioning well, and the Prime Minister lacks control. The political process is fraught with friction due to radical elements vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds a significant number of seats in the Parliament.",
            "I expressed some thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, I felt it was pointless because it wasn't a declared war, and it seemed like a revenge mission against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not well-informed about the war, but I believe our presence there is to build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's justified to stay, as it's causing unrest and may lead to long-term issues. The creation of democracy can't happen overnight, and leaving would result in anger and having to start over. It's a challenging topic for me, as I don't know much about it. I think the war should continue, but it's hard to call it a war as it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I feel Bush's actions are making him look bad. I believe the war could be seen as a meaningless conflict, much like the Vietnam War. It's difficult to say if I want the war to continue, as there are families with relatives serving in Iraq, but staying may cause more harm in the long run. The culture clash could lead to increased hatred towards the U.S. and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda. I think this war will continue for many years. That's about it.",
            "I genuinely don't feel that it's appropriate for a state to legalize or outlaw it. I believe this decision should be left to the churches, as the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state clearly states. Attempting to impose any authority on this matter would be a defiance of the Constitution. I think those advocating for its illegality are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it’s the government's place to decide what the churches can and cannot legalize. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution and promotes religious tolerance. I don't think an amendment on this matter is necessary or right, as it would go against what's already established in the Constitution and could potentially restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be solely based on his personal Catholic beliefs, demonstrating a preference for one religion over others. Therefore, I believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the government. There doesn't seem to be any substantial reason for an amendment banning it, and it could even have a positive impact on society.",
            "I believe the government was not entirely honest with Americans about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. The invasion was made to appear connected to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but that wasn't the case. The government exploited the public's outrage to gain support for the war. I was against the war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq mirrors many aspects of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from the mistakes made there. The loss of American lives was immense, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. The US removed the Iraqi government and attempted to establish a democratic one, similar to what was done in Vietnam. However, the process was long and difficult, and the government underestimated the challenges. I feel the US government misled the American people into believing the war would be short and successful. Democracy takes time to establish and stabilize, as it did in the US itself. I also question why Iraq was the only country targeted for democracy when other countries with similar issues were not. The main reason seems to be access to oil. The claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was not supported by evidence, while countries like North Korea, which do have such weapons, were not targeted. I hope the war ends soon, but I expect it will not.",
            "I am in favor of same-sex marriage. I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice and that it's increasingly being recognized as a biological inclination rather than a societal influence. Taking away rights due to something that's out of one's control is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should be involved in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples who function just like any other family. I think it's absurd for Bush to try and dictate marriage based on his personal interpretations. I've read that being gay might be influenced by biological factors rather than societal ones. Additionally, same-sex couples shouldn't face the same level of scrutiny and public attention as opposite-sex couples. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public and accessible to anyone. As an example, I, as a teacher, have dealt with this issue before. When you put information out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you discuss topics like violence or harmful actions, someone might interpret your posts in a serious way. The internet is seen by everyone, including friends on social platforms like Myspace. If something is posted, it can reach the school, which then has to act upon it to ensure safety. However, you can't always know what to take seriously, as some people might post things as jokes. For instance, a student might have written something about a sociology experiment gone wrong, which could also be interpreted as a serious threat. When you post something online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret your posts. While school officials shouldn't friend students on social media, if a threat is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't monitor private communications, but if something is reported, they have to act. Similarly, I wouldn't friend my students on social media to avoid seeing inappropriate content.",
            "The conflict appears to have lasted much longer than necessary. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, it seems that we've strayed from that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're continuing the war for the sake of proving our power, rather than for any genuine reason.\n\nThe initial push had a clear message, but the prolonged duration is now excessive. The war has been going on for over a year, possibly even years. While the intention to bring democracy to a tyrannized country was valid, I believe our cause has been diluted and misguided. It seems we're now engaged in a war for the sake of waging war, rather than achieving a clear goal.\n\nWe've stretched our resources thin, spending billions of dollars on this conflict. We have our own domestic issues to address, such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These are areas where our money could be much better spent. Instead, we're draining our economy while also putting our citizens' lives at risk in a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to ask a question to clarify:\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and discovered that there was like\n\nOkay\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand on Myspace, you need to have someone else be your friend to see their profile. You might need to\nKnow, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it.\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good,\nThat someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost,\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough,\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that,\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think,\nO let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\nUm\nI mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles,\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles\nAnd just happened to see that,\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know,\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\nSo, I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell,\nLike,\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook,\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me,\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\nUm,\nThis man who just,\nHe was just trying to prove how easy it is to get information,\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away,\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger,\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him,\nAnd I mean,\nPersonally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone,\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me,\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests,\nThey know what you look like,\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\nWho your friends are,\nThey pretty much know a lot about you,\nAll sorts of photos,\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there,\nBut at the same time,\nThe whole point\nI think,\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends,\nI don't want to limit it too much,\nSo it's a tricky issue,\nBecause I only accept people I know,\nI mean you never know really,\nWho can look at what,\nSo\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school,\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school,\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange,\nLike I wasn't sure how,\nHow high school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue,\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",

            "Yes, indeed, I believe that gender discrimination is still prevalent in the United States. It's not just women, though; discrimination can also occur within specific job fields. For example, women face the \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite their qualifications, they may not be promoted to higher positions because it's not customary for women to hold such roles. Similarly, men who stay at home to care for their children face societal disapproval, as society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they're straight, as they are perceived as not understanding women's fashion. I feel that gender discrimination exists across various industries and locations. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's crucial to continue promoting the qualities of those stereotyped against without being too forceful. In the meantime, we must recognize that people from different backgrounds can also face discrimination, whether due to their gender, job type, or where they grew from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This change reduced marijuana possession from a criminal offense to a minor infraction similar to getting a traffic ticket, where you receive a citation rather than experiencing arrest and other legal processes. When someone is cited for possessing marijuana, it can still negatively impact job prospects and other life aspects, as is the case with drug charges. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on law enforcement and the legal system, potentially saving money. However, some communities may be financially strained and philosophically opposed to decriminalizing marijuana. In places like Denver, with a more open and liberal mindset, decriminalization may be seen as a viable option to redirect resources into education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be widely available in public spaces, its legalization could lead to it being sold openly, like cigarettes, which could cause issues with public smoking and driving under the influence. Alcohol and marijuana both have adverse effects on individuals, but reactions vary greatly, and moderation is key.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause while many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition and it's good to maintain those roots, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. I believe that a lot of Catholics are very strict about following the weekly church attendance and doctrine, which can make those who don't adhere to these rules feel judged or unwelcome. For instance, my parents had different religious beliefs – my mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian – and they were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church due to my father's religion. This lack of tolerance for other religions feels hypocritical considering the Catholic teaching to love others. I feel that the Catholic Church often practices traditions that contradict their teachings due to their outdated nature. I don't believe that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent child molestation, as the issue is more about personal character than marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue. I can't definitively say whether one side is right or wrong because it's such a contentious topic. It's particularly tricky due to the sensitive balance between church and state and how to legally define marriage. I believe all civil unions should be treated the same, regardless of religious or personal beliefs. If a couple is married, I think the government should treat it as a civil union, rather than inquire about its religious significance. As for gay marriage, I think each state should come to a rational decision and push for nationwide recognition. However, amending the constitution to ban it is unreasonable; it's not a pressing enough issue to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian family, so my stance on homosexuality is somewhat complex. I have many gay friends, and while I don't entirely support the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue but rather something that should be decided individually by each state. Many states are democratic and will likely push for gay marriage, and it's important to respect their decisions since people choose to live there. I don't believe the president should impose their views on every state. I think the decision should be left up to individual states, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "I wouldn't say no, in fact. If you consider what Myspace is, it's essentially a platform where you can post things for the public to see. When you post something online, you have to be aware that many people, including school officials, might see it. Therefore, if school officials see it, they have the right to do so, especially if it's to prevent something like a school shooting. Even though they might be checking for things like students drinking or smoking, it's understandable if it helps to make the school safer. It's a public thing, and students should be aware of that. I'm not saying they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it leads them to make the school safer, then I think it's fine. Similarly, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy if it helps the school officials in their duty to keep students safe. I've discussed this with a teacher, and it's important for schools to ensure safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. So, while I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I do understand the concern about privacy. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Initially, I supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. However, I now believe that our response was driven primarily by emotion and a lack of long-term planning. We invaded Iraq unprepared and without a clear strategy. In retrospect, I think the war was a mistake. I'm now strongly against it. I don't believe our presence has done anything to deter further attacks. In fact, I think the internal conflicts in the region are preventing any real progress. I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel that they are capable of fighting each other but not with us. I believe we should have a better plan before entering a conflict. We were more focused on revenge than rational thinking. President Bush, driven by public opinion, declared war on Iraq, which I understand, but I think we could have handled it differently. The lack of unity and clear objectives in our mission hurt our cause. I don't believe we can or should try to change their culture. I think they'll continue to be the same. I don't see enough progress to justify our continued presence, and I believe their situation will deteriorate once we leave. We're only harming ourselves by staying there."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from certain changes in its views. There has been discussion about the Church losing some of its followers, which I attribute to its stance on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While the Church has strong views on these topics, they can sometimes be considered outdated. If the Church were to adopt a more modern perspective, it might be able to retain its following. Some people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to disagreements over its stances on these issues. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might not feel comfortable in a community that considers these practices wrong. While I don't see any reason why women couldn't be priests or priests couldn't be married, I'm not certain if these changes would have prevented the Church's current challenges.",
            "In my opinion, I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I don't think it's something that's chosen; it's more of an inherent part of who someone is. Therefore, I don't think gay people should be held accountable for their sexual orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can get married but people of the same sex can't. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. I don't think it's a choice, like being straight is not a choice either. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal issue or a moral concern. It's just how people are born, and they shouldn't be penalized for that.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There's no compelling reason to prevent it. Many opponents claim that gay couples threaten the traditional heterosexual family, but these relationships are unique and multifaceted, and cannot be equated to heterosexual ones. They are essentially two sides of the same coin, with the same rights and responsibilities. For instance, without legal recognition, a gay partner can't visit or be present when their partner is ill, or make decisions about their partner's healthcare. Additionally, numerous scientific studies have shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples.\n\nThe core issue here is that same-sex couples are not seeking religious marriage ceremonies, but simply legal marriage certificates. If civil unions are allowed, why not marriage? It's like having separate but unequal laws; it's not logical to deny one group the same rights and benefits. People also often worry about adoption and community issues, but these concerns are unfounded. Parenting skills are the same regardless of sexual orientation. Children of gay couples can and do thrive in their communities just like children of straight couples.\n\nThe federal government should legalize same-sex marriage in all states. I think the current amendment should be reversed. However, President Bush's stance on this issue is strongly influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most arguments against gay marriage are rooted in morality, which is subjective and varies among individuals. It's hypocritical for the government to support certain religious beliefs while ignoring others, especially considering recent controversies around religious influence in political decisions.\n\nMany people oppose same-sex marriage because they believe it's a result of psychological damage or trauma, but this is not supported by scientific evidence. Ignoring the findings of reputable institutions like the American Psychological Association and instead relying on personal beliefs and popular opinions can lead to a narrow-minded view of the world.",
            "Firstly, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. To clarify, the legality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its benefits. While I wouldn't advocate for general public access, I believe it can have medicinal uses. Illegal doesn't mean beneficial; it simply isn't beneficial. Additionally, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in hospitals because they provide benefits when used appropriately. I don't see a significant difference between marijuana and these drugs, and I think we should consider its potential benefits. I suggest legalizing it gradually, not all at once, to prevent abuse. People's negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. Once we remove this stigma, people can potentially use it responsibly and for medicinal purposes. However, I don't see the need to compare it to heroin or cocaine, as they are entirely different substances.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century. It's less strict now compared to how it used to be. When I was younger, I would go to church every Sunday and always wear cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. Now, they have a teen mass that only lasts 30 minutes, and people dress more casually, especially during summer. Even in the morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up. The church I know has seen the biggest changes in that aspect. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's the main thing I've noticed. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe some people are inherently attracted to children, regardless of their marital status. The church can't change that. It's more about the individual person's genetics and upbringing. If they knowingly covered up cases, they're at fault, but not all cases were known. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the initial premise, but I believe that the September 11th attacks were still fresh in everyone's minds, which may have led to the decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration connected the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. This bothers me greatly and the Iraq war really agitates me.\n\nI feel that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and hasn't taken responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced at the time. This, to me, constitutes a dereliction of duty and should be grounds for impeachment. I think the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution and has tried to undermine it since 9/11. The administration entered office with a goal to go to war.\n\nThere have been allegations that George W. Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and there may have been a desire to increase our energy supply, which is a rather underhanded motivation.\n\nI believe the war has gone on too long, but I'm concerned that pulling out now could lead to a civil war and more deaths. The UN and the US are now considering a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order, but I'm not sure this is a good idea. It could cause long-term problems, as Iraq's sovereignty is already an issue, and the interim government seems ineffective. News reports suggest the Parliament is not functioning well, and the Prime Minister lacks control. The political process is fraught with friction due to radical elements vying for control, including Muqtada al-Sadr's party, which holds a significant number of seats in the Parliament.",
            "I expressed some thoughts on the War in Iraq. Initially, I felt it was pointless because it wasn't a declared war, and it seemed like a revenge mission against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks. I'm not well-informed about the war, but I believe our presence there is to build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's justified to stay, as it's causing unrest and may lead to long-term issues. The creation of democracy can't happen overnight, and leaving would result in anger and having to start over. It's a challenging topic for me, as I don't know much about it. I think the war should continue, but it's hard to call it a war as it wasn't officially declared by Congress. I feel Bush's actions are making him look bad. I believe the war could be seen as a meaningless conflict, much like the Vietnam War. It's difficult to say if I want the war to continue, as there are families with relatives serving in Iraq, but staying may cause more harm in the long run. The culture clash could lead to increased hatred towards the U.S. and the growth of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda. I think this war will continue for many years. That's about it.",
            "I genuinely don't feel that it's appropriate for a state to legalize or outlaw it. I believe this decision should be left to the churches, as the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state clearly states. Attempting to impose any authority on this matter would be a defiance of the Constitution. I think those advocating for its illegality are essentially choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it, except for a few areas like Boston. I don't believe it’s the government's place to decide what the churches can and cannot legalize. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the U.S. Constitution and promotes religious tolerance. I don't think an amendment on this matter is necessary or right, as it would go against what's already established in the Constitution and could potentially restrict people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government, or any government, should be involved in this issue. The president's push for an amendment seems to be solely based on his personal Catholic beliefs, demonstrating a preference for one religion over others. Therefore, I believe it's up to the churches to decide this matter, not the government. There doesn't seem to be any substantial reason for an amendment banning it, and it could even have a positive impact on society.",
            "I believe the government was not entirely honest with Americans about the reasons for going to war in Iraq. The invasion was made to appear connected to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but that wasn't the case. The government exploited the public's outrage to gain support for the war. I was against the war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq mirrors many aspects of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from the mistakes made there. The loss of American lives was immense, and the government was not prepared for the aftermath and the power vacuum that would follow. The US removed the Iraqi government and attempted to establish a democratic one, similar to what was done in Vietnam. However, the process was long and difficult, and the government underestimated the challenges. I feel the US government misled the American people into believing the war would be short and successful. Democracy takes time to establish and stabilize, as it did in the US itself. I also question why Iraq was the only country targeted for democracy when other countries with similar issues were not. The main reason seems to be access to oil. The claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was not supported by evidence, while countries like North Korea, which do have such weapons, were not targeted. I hope the war ends soon, but I expect it will not.",
            "I am in favor of same-sex marriage. I always have been. I believe it's a personal choice and that it's increasingly being recognized as a biological inclination rather than a societal influence. Taking away rights due to something that's out of one's control is inhumane. I've always been an advocate for same-sex marriage. I don't think politics or government should be involved in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. My neighborhood has a few openly gay couples who function just like any other family. I think it's absurd for Bush to try and dictate marriage based on his personal interpretations. I've read that being gay might be influenced by biological factors rather than societal ones. Additionally, same-sex couples shouldn't face the same level of scrutiny and public attention as opposite-sex couples. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public and accessible to anyone. As an example, I, as a teacher, have dealt with this issue before. When you put information out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you discuss topics like violence or harmful actions, someone might interpret your posts in a serious way. The internet is seen by everyone, including friends on social platforms like Myspace. If something is posted, it can reach the school, which then has to act upon it to ensure safety. However, you can't always know what to take seriously, as some people might post things as jokes. For instance, a student might have written something about a sociology experiment gone wrong, which could also be interpreted as a serious threat. When you post something online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want something seen, don't post it. You can't control what people think or how they interpret your posts. While school officials shouldn't friend students on social media, if a threat is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't monitor private communications, but if something is reported, they have to act. Similarly, I wouldn't friend my students on social media to avoid seeing inappropriate content.",
            "The conflict appears to have lasted much longer than necessary. Initially, the goal was commendable - to restore democracy in a country without a fair political system. However, it seems that we've strayed from that original purpose. Now, it feels like we're continuing the war for the sake of proving our power, rather than for any genuine reason.\n\nThe initial push had a clear message, but the prolonged duration is now excessive. The war has been going on for over a year, possibly even years. While the intention to bring democracy to a tyrannized country was valid, I believe our cause has been diluted and misguided. It seems we're now engaged in a war for the sake of waging war, rather than achieving a clear goal.\n\nWe've stretched our resources thin, spending billions of dollars on this conflict. We have our own domestic issues to address, such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. These are areas where our money could be much better spent. Instead, we're draining our economy while also putting our citizens' lives at risk in a war that has lost its original purpose.",
            "I'd like to ask a question to clarify:\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and discovered that there was like\n\nOkay\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand on Myspace, you need to have someone else be your friend to see their profile. You might need to\nKnow, you've accepted that person as your \"friend,\" so they can see it.\nYou're giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo anytime you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good,\nThat someone saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost,\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough,\nBecause I mean obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that,\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think,\nO let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\nUm\nI mean\nI don't think it would really be right\nTo go and have someone's job be to look at people's profiles,\nBut I guess it all depends\nOn like what situation they came across that profile,\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles\nAnd just happened to see that,\nOr were they actually looking for\nYou know,\nSome sort of evidence that the student was planning something.\nSo, I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell,\nLike,\nI mean I don't have a Myspace personally but I have a Facebook,\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me,\nAnd I saw something on TV once that was about this,\nUm,\nThis man who just,\nHe was just trying to prove how easy it is to get information,\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away,\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger,\nIn like you know less than a minute and got her to meet with him,\nAnd I mean,\nPersonally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone,\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know that it's me,\nAnd it\nIt's hard because you think that they know your interests,\nThey know what you look like,\nSometimes if you put your class schedule they know where you are during the day,\nWho your friends are,\nThey pretty much know a lot about you,\nAll sorts of photos,\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there,\nBut at the same time,\nThe whole point\nI think,\nThe reason I have one is so you know I can communicate with some of my friends,\nI don't want to limit it too much,\nSo it's a tricky issue,\nBecause I only accept people I know,\nI mean you never know really,\nWho can look at what,\nSo\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that her\nUm\nHigh school,\nThere was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school,\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange,\nLike I wasn't sure how,\nHow high school officials had the power to tell their students\nThat they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue,\nBut I think\nI don't really know\nHow they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes",

            "Yes, indeed, I believe that gender discrimination is still prevalent in the United States. It's not just women, though; discrimination can also occur within specific job fields. For example, women face the \"glass ceiling,\" where, despite their qualifications, they may not be promoted to higher positions because it's not customary for women to hold such roles. Similarly, men who stay at home to care for their children face societal disapproval, as society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners. In the fashion industry, men may not be taken seriously if they're straight, as they are perceived as not understanding women's fashion. I feel that gender discrimination exists across various industries and locations. While progress has been made, change is slow, and it's crucial to continue promoting the qualities of those stereotyped against without being too forceful. In the meantime, we must recognize that people from different backgrounds can also face discrimination, whether due to their gender, job type, or where they grew from.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it; they decriminalized it. This change reduced marijuana possession from a criminal offense to a minor infraction similar to getting a traffic ticket, where you receive a citation rather than experiencing arrest and other legal processes. When someone is cited for possessing marijuana, it can still negatively impact job prospects and other life aspects, as is the case with drug charges. While decriminalization doesn't eliminate future ramifications, it does reduce the burden on law enforcement and the legal system, potentially saving money. However, some communities may be financially strained and philosophically opposed to decriminalizing marijuana. In places like Denver, with a more open and liberal mindset, decriminalization may be seen as a viable option to redirect resources into education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. While marijuana shouldn't be widely available in public spaces, its legalization could lead to it being sold openly, like cigarettes, which could cause issues with public smoking and driving under the influence. Alcohol and marijuana both have adverse effects on individuals, but reactions vary greatly, and moderation is key.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause while many Catholic practices are deeply rooted in tradition and it's good to maintain those roots, it's also crucial to be adaptable to change. I believe that a lot of Catholics are very strict about following the weekly church attendance and doctrine, which can make those who don't adhere to these rules feel judged or unwelcome. For instance, my parents had different religious beliefs – my mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian – and they were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church due to my father's religion. This lack of tolerance for other religions feels hypocritical considering the Catholic teaching to love others. I feel that the Catholic Church often practices traditions that contradict their teachings due to their outdated nature. I don't believe that allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent child molestation, as the issue is more about personal character than marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue. I can't definitively say whether one side is right or wrong because it's such a contentious topic. It's particularly tricky due to the sensitive balance between church and state and how to legally define marriage. I believe all civil unions should be treated the same, regardless of religious or personal beliefs. If a couple is married, I think the government should treat it as a civil union, rather than inquire about its religious significance. As for gay marriage, I think each state should come to a rational decision and push for nationwide recognition. However, amending the constitution to ban it is unreasonable; it's not a pressing enough issue to warrant a constitutional amendment. It's just not important enough.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian family, so my stance on homosexuality is somewhat complex. I have many gay friends, and while I don't entirely support the lifestyle, I believe it should be legalized. I don't see it as a national issue but rather something that should be decided individually by each state. Many states are democratic and will likely push for gay marriage, and it's important to respect their decisions since people choose to live there. I don't believe the president should impose their views on every state. I think the decision should be left up to individual states, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences, not the president.",
            "I wouldn't say no, in fact. If you consider what Myspace is, it's essentially a platform where you can post things for the public to see. When you post something online, you have to be aware that many people, including school officials, might see it. Therefore, if school officials see it, they have the right to do so, especially if it's to prevent something like a school shooting. Even though they might be checking for things like students drinking or smoking, it's understandable if it helps to make the school safer. It's a public thing, and students should be aware of that. I'm not saying they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it leads them to make the school safer, then I think it's fine. Similarly, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy if it helps the school officials in their duty to keep students safe. I've discussed this with a teacher, and it's important for schools to ensure safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. So, while I don't think it's an invasion of privacy, I do understand the concern about privacy. That's all I have to say on the matter.",
            "Initially, I supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. However, I now believe that our response was driven primarily by emotion and a lack of long-term planning. We invaded Iraq unprepared and without a clear strategy. In retrospect, I think the war was a mistake. I'm now strongly against it. I don't believe our presence has done anything to deter further attacks. In fact, I think the internal conflicts in the region are preventing any real progress. I've lost interest in what happens over there. I feel that they are capable of fighting each other but not with us. I believe we should have a better plan before entering a conflict. We were more focused on revenge than rational thinking. President Bush, driven by public opinion, declared war on Iraq, which I understand, but I think we could have handled it differently. The lack of unity and clear objectives in our mission hurt our cause. I don't believe we can or should try to change their culture. I think they'll continue to be the same. I don't see enough progress to justify our continued presence, and I believe their situation will deteriorate once we leave. We're only harming ourselves by staying there."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. I've heard discussions about their dwindling membership, and I think it's due to their unaccepting stance on many issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their views are strong but somewhat outdated. If they embraced a more modern perspective, they might not face the same loss of followers. People are starting to disagree with the Church's positions on these subjects, causing some to turn away. For instance, if one is pro-choice or supports same-sex marriage, they may not feel comfortable following a church that opposes these views. I don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests, but I'm unsure if these changes would prevent the issues they currently face. The Church's loyalty to God, as they claim, should not preclude them from also having a family life. Everyone else manages to balance work and family life, so I see no reason why priests can't do the same.",
            "I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that sexual orientation isn't something people choose; it's just who they are. People shouldn't be judged or held accountable for it. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't. I think it's wrong for the government to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, I don't think the government should interfere because it's not a matter of national security or moral right. It's not the government's place to dictate who can and can't marry. It's not something that gay people should be penalized for, as it's a part of their nature.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized due to the lack of substantial arguments against it. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but they are different in numerous ways that prevent them from being considered the same. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Numerous civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should be extended to same-sex couples. For instance, a same-sex partner cannot visit or support a sick spouse in the hospital if not deemed \"family.\" I think it's absurd to deny this right to couples who will spend their lives together. Scientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is that people often conflate religious marriage with civil marriage. Same-sex couples are not requesting church ceremonies but rather legal recognition. If civil unions are acceptable, why not marriage? Segregation in the past was \"separate but unequal.\" Same-sex couples form relationships and have the same challenges and triumphs as heterosexual couples. Adoption and community concerns are valid, but evidence shows children are resilient and adaptable. School bullying is more of an issue than the children's upbringing. The federal government should make same-sex marriage legal nationwide. President Bush, influenced by his religious beliefs, opposes it, but moral viewpoints differ among individuals and groups. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country. People often hold negative views of homosexuality due to misconceptions about its origin, but psychological research contradicts these beliefs. People should rely on credible institutions rather than popular opinion to shape their views.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Let me clarify that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. While I believe it should not be available to the general public, it can be used for medicinal purposes. I understand that some illegal drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are beneficial and widely used in pharmacies. Similarly, I think marijuana can be beneficial and used for medical purposes, even though it is illegal. It's important to distinguish that marijuana's illegal status is not a reflection of its intrinsic value or potential benefits. Moreover, I don't believe marijuana is as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. I think it's crucial to remove the negative stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then gradually integrate it into legal frameworks. People should be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than in the past. As a child, I recall dressing up in cute outfits every Sunday when I attended church regularly. Now, I notice a more casual atmosphere, with services lasting only 30 minutes and people wearing beach clothes or jeans and khakis. The church I know has also grown more casual, even during morning masses. However, I don't know the politics of the church, so I can't comment on that.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been avoided by allowing female priests or priests to marry. Pedophilia is often a result of genetics, not marital status. Some men married with children may still be attracted to young kids, and I think the church couldn't have prevented these incidents. If they knew about them and covered them up, that would be wrong, but I don't believe they always did.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but the September 11th attacks had everyone shaken, and I believe we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, with the Bush administration falsely linking the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. This has always bothered me, and it still does. The administration lied to the American people, according to even Colin Powell, who later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented. I believe this is a serious issue and could potentially be an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration disregarded the constitution from the start, with a vengeance-driven agenda against Saddam Hussein, and possibly also aiming to secure more energy resources. Withdrawing now might lead to civil war, but the UN and US's plan to involve neighboring countries doesn't seem reliable in the long run due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the weak, divided interim government. The political process is chaotic, with radical elements vying for control.",

            "I truly don't think it's appropriate for a state to legalize or declare as legal something that the churches themselves should decide on. The Constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and any attempt to enforce rules over this would be a defiance of the constitutional principles. I believe that it's up to the churches to decide on such matters, and not the government. It's important to note that the vast majority of Catholics and Christians in the United States are against it, except in a few specific areas like Boston. The push for an amendment to make this illegal seems to be motivated by personal religious beliefs, which is not a valid reason for government intervention. I don't see how this would positively impact the economy or society. Therefore, I don't feel it's right for the government to be involved in this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nWell, to begin with, I believe the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, which in reality had little to do with Iraq. They exploited the public's anger and outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally oppose wars, especially preventive ones, and I think the government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the Vietnam War. The war in Iraq, like Vietnam, resulted in a significant loss of American lives and the removal of the Iraqi government. The government seemed unprepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a long, challenging process.\n\nThe government should have planned better for all possible outcomes and prepared for the long-term commitment required to stabilize a post-war country. The U.S. has been in Iraq for several years, and the conflict remains unresolved. I believe the government's initial portrayal of the war was misleading, making it seem like a short, successful campaign. The reality, however, is that establishing democracy is a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have supported George Bush if I could vote, mainly because I wanted him to finish what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult due to the high number of American casualties and the question of how much risk it's worth to establish a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, it's unclear why Iraq was the focus when other countries with similar issues have not been targeted.\n\nThe primary reason for invading Iraq was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. Other nations with confirmed weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, have not been targeted. This raises concerns about the honesty and thoroughness of the government's decision-making process.\n\nI hope the conflict ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm not optimistic about it happening anytime soon.",
            "I'm in favor of gay marriage. I've always held this view. I truly believe it's a personal choice, and research is increasingly suggesting it's more biological than sociological. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to deny people rights over something beyond their control, which seems inhuman to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and the government shouldn't interfere in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who function just like any other family, despite not being married due to the law. I think it's absurd for Bush to try to interpret the definition of marriage according to his beliefs. I've heard and read from many sources that being gay might be predisposed due to brain chemistry, not societal influences. It's just as personal and private as a heterosexual marriage. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to marry, it becomes a public affair. I believe it should be a personal, private matter, not a public or national issue.",
            "When you post something online, you're putting it out in a public forum. Everyone can see it, including people who might not have anything to do with you. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this personally. Once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing dangerous topics like bomb threats or shootings. If you're friends with someone on a social media platform like Myspace, they'll see your posts, and the school might too. If authorities hear about something potentially harmful, they can't ignore it, even if it might just be a joke gone wrong. Once something is online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. People can't control what others think or do with the information they find. While school officials shouldn't be friends with students online, if something dangerous comes to their attention, it's their job to take it seriously. Monitoring private conversations isn't appropriate, but if information is brought to their attention, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake profiles to monitor students, and I, as an R.A., wouldn't friend residents to keep track of their online activities. It's not my responsibility or desired to know what they're doing on social media.",
            "The war seems to have dragged on excessively. Initially, the aim was commendable, with the goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have strayed from this original purpose and are now involved in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. The motives behind the war may have been dubious, possibly influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. At the outset, the war served as a declaration of intent, but the prolonged conflict has blurred that purpose. The war has become an end in itself, and it's unclear if our initial goals were ever achieved. It's been going on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take control of its own affairs. We've been spending billions on this war at the expense of addressing our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own country and not on prolonged wars. It's time to end this conflict and redirect our resources towards our own pressing needs.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that something was prevented because someone found information online about it. Isn't that an invasion of privacy? When you post information on the internet, it's generally available for everyone to see, especially on platforms like Myspace. While you may need to be friends with someone to view their profile, if you give them permission to see it, it means you've accepted that trade-off. Therefore, when you put information online, you should understand that many people will see it. In this case, I believe it was good that someone found the information and prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nHowever, constantly monitoring everyone's profiles is not practical or fair, as it could lead to discrimination. It's important to consider the context in which the profile was found, whether someone was actively looking for evidence or just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that I know there are creepy people who can access my information. I've seen a TV show where a man easily found a girl's screen name and met her in less than a minute. This raises concerns about privacy and the ease with which people can gather personal information. I try to limit what I post, but I also want to maintain my online presence to communicate with friends. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've also heard that in high school, some students were banned from using Myspace by their school, which I found odd. I'm not sure how school officials have the right to restrict students' online activities. It seems like a privacy issue, but I'm not sure about the specifics.",
            "I have a few things to say about the Iraq War, but I feel uncomfortable doing so. I don't want to join those who claim they were against it from the start, as it's not really relevant now. The general consensus, except within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea. Polls show that 75-80% of people worldwide, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. The situation has been a disaster from the beginning and will continue to be so if we stay. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is too great for us to impose our views on them. Saddam was bad, but the potential consequences of invading had to be weighed against the benefits. I don't see any reason for us to stay. The administration may have reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any compelling ones. I'm open to a gradual withdrawal, but I think we should leave now. Eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year. We should respect their wishes. Leaving now would make us the good guys, even if we can't be the heroes we'd like to be.",
            "Yes, I do indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not just about women; it also extends to certain professions and societal expectations. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" where, despite being qualified, they may not be promoted to higher positions due to historical biases that favor men in leadership roles. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home with their children face societal disapproval and are often seen as less capable because of archaic gender roles. In the fashion industry, men are sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously if they're straight, as they're perceived as not understanding fashion from a woman's perspective. Discrimination isn't limited to gender; it also arises from one's background and education level. Ensuring equality is a gradual process, but progress is being made as more women are entering higher positions and societal attitudes are slowly changing. However, rushing these changes would only meet with resistance, so a balanced approach is key.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t make it legal. They decriminalized it, reducing the offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge with potential jail time. If someone gets caught, the penalty is like a citation, not a full arrest. While this change might be beneficial for job applications and other areas where criminal charges can be detrimental, the societal perception of marijuana use and its potential consequences on behavior and lifestyle remain significant concerns. Decriminalization can also save money for local governments by reducing the need for arrests, trials, and incarceration. However, not all communities are willing to make this change, especially those with strong anti-marijuana sentiments. In more liberal places like Denver, decriminalization has been well-received, allowing the city to allocate more funds to education and social programs. While marijuana should not be made readily available like cigarettes, it’s important to consider the potential financial benefits of decriminalization. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects, their impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people may use substances responsibly, while others may not. Therefore, it's difficult to generalize the effects of substances.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nMany of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing these things for a long time\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to have a strong connection to tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible and adapt to change\nUm\nMany Catholics believe they must attend church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey adhere strictly to how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church can be harsh towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't accept people who aren't completely Catholic\nAnd\nThey also don't accept people of other religions\nUm\nFor example\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nMy mother was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my father's religion\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat's not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat's a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it's so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say if one side is correct or incorrect. However, I do think this is the most challenging topic we're currently dealing with. It's difficult to address the separation of church and state and how to define marriage without upsetting someone. I'm not sure whether all civil unions should be seen as marriage, or how the government should classify them. After all, people wouldn't get special treatment or recognition for being married if they were just baptized. Therefore, I believe that couples who are married should be seen as in a civil union. That's what it is - two people united together. So, if all states can agree on a logical approach, they should work towards making it a federal law. However, I think it's ridiculous to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. It's not a pressing enough issue to warrant such a significant change.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so I must admit that the topic of homosexuality is a bit ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, and I feel that the decision should be left to each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nA lot of states are predominantly Democratic, and in these states, there's likely to be support for gay marriage. If you're living in a state that supports it, it's not fair to disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect that.\n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be decided on a state-by-state basis. I don't believe that the current president should be able to impose his views on all the states. Each state should make its own decision, as they will be the ones affected by it.\n\nI don't think it's fair for the president to decide how every state should run, especially since he won't be in office for much longer. If a new president from a different party changes their mind on the issue, it could just go back and forth. Therefore, it's best to leave the decision up to each individual state.",
            "Let's discuss the matter at hand. I don't entirely agree with the notion that Myspace is private. By definition, a bulletin board is meant for public viewing. If a student posts anything on the internet, they should be aware that it's visible to others, including school officials. They have every right to see it, even if it's not posted under the school's name, as they can access it from their personal devices. However, if the purpose is to prevent a school shooting, then I believe it's justified. School officials should only monitor students if they have reason to believe it's for the safety of the students and the school. Constantly monitoring students without cause is an invasion of privacy. I wouldn't expect students to post something with the intent of getting caught, and the same goes for school officials. If they're monitoring to prevent harm or create a safer environment, it's acceptable. However, I don't think it's justifiable to monitor students' online activities to catch them in questionable behaviors. It's important to remember that once something is posted online, it's there forever, and it can come back to haunt them. I believe that the school officials were acting in good faith to ensure the safety of the students and the school.",
            "Initially, I wholeheartedly supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I believed we should retaliate and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, looking back, I think we were driven more by emotions and lacked a clear plan. We went in unprepared and naive about what we would encounter. I'm now firmly against the war as I don't believe we've achieved anything meaningful. The people in the region seem more interested in fighting each other than us, and their war tactics are vastly different from ours. I feel we were more driven by emotion and revenge than strategic planning. The Iraq War was declared partly due to public pressure, and while we didn't have a choice but to react, our approach was flawed. There was no clear objective or unity regarding what we were supposed to achieve. I don't think we can change their culture, and I'm doubtful we'll make enough progress to justify our prolonged presence. We're only hurting ourselves by staying. No, it's time to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. I've heard discussions about their dwindling membership, and I think it's due to their unaccepting stance on many issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their views are strong but somewhat outdated. If they embraced a more modern perspective, they might not face the same loss of followers. People are starting to disagree with the Church's positions on these subjects, causing some to turn away. For instance, if one is pro-choice or supports same-sex marriage, they may not feel comfortable following a church that opposes these views. I don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests, but I'm unsure if these changes would prevent the issues they currently face. The Church's loyalty to God, as they claim, should not preclude them from also having a family life. Everyone else manages to balance work and family life, so I see no reason why priests can't do the same.",
            "I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that sexual orientation isn't something people choose; it's just who they are. People shouldn't be judged or held accountable for it. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't. I think it's wrong for the government to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, I don't think the government should interfere because it's not a matter of national security or moral right. It's not the government's place to dictate who can and can't marry. It's not something that gay people should be penalized for, as it's a part of their nature.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized due to the lack of substantial arguments against it. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but they are different in numerous ways that prevent them from being considered the same. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Numerous civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should be extended to same-sex couples. For instance, a same-sex partner cannot visit or support a sick spouse in the hospital if not deemed \"family.\" I think it's absurd to deny this right to couples who will spend their lives together. Scientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is that people often conflate religious marriage with civil marriage. Same-sex couples are not requesting church ceremonies but rather legal recognition. If civil unions are acceptable, why not marriage? Segregation in the past was \"separate but unequal.\" Same-sex couples form relationships and have the same challenges and triumphs as heterosexual couples. Adoption and community concerns are valid, but evidence shows children are resilient and adaptable. School bullying is more of an issue than the children's upbringing. The federal government should make same-sex marriage legal nationwide. President Bush, influenced by his religious beliefs, opposes it, but moral viewpoints differ among individuals and groups. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country. People often hold negative views of homosexuality due to misconceptions about its origin, but psychological research contradicts these beliefs. People should rely on credible institutions rather than popular opinion to shape their views.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Let me clarify that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. While I believe it should not be available to the general public, it can be used for medicinal purposes. I understand that some illegal drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are beneficial and widely used in pharmacies. Similarly, I think marijuana can be beneficial and used for medical purposes, even though it is illegal. It's important to distinguish that marijuana's illegal status is not a reflection of its intrinsic value or potential benefits. Moreover, I don't believe marijuana is as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. I think it's crucial to remove the negative stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then gradually integrate it into legal frameworks. People should be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than in the past. As a child, I recall dressing up in cute outfits every Sunday when I attended church regularly. Now, I notice a more casual atmosphere, with services lasting only 30 minutes and people wearing beach clothes or jeans and khakis. The church I know has also grown more casual, even during morning masses. However, I don't know the politics of the church, so I can't comment on that.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been avoided by allowing female priests or priests to marry. Pedophilia is often a result of genetics, not marital status. Some men married with children may still be attracted to young kids, and I think the church couldn't have prevented these incidents. If they knew about them and covered them up, that would be wrong, but I don't believe they always did.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but the September 11th attacks had everyone shaken, and I believe we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, with the Bush administration falsely linking the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. This has always bothered me, and it still does. The administration lied to the American people, according to even Colin Powell, who later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented. I believe this is a serious issue and could potentially be an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration disregarded the constitution from the start, with a vengeance-driven agenda against Saddam Hussein, and possibly also aiming to secure more energy resources. Withdrawing now might lead to civil war, but the UN and US's plan to involve neighboring countries doesn't seem reliable in the long run due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the weak, divided interim government. The political process is chaotic, with radical elements vying for control.",

            "I truly don't think it's appropriate for a state to legalize or declare as legal something that the churches themselves should decide on. The Constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and any attempt to enforce rules over this would be a defiance of the constitutional principles. I believe that it's up to the churches to decide on such matters, and not the government. It's important to note that the vast majority of Catholics and Christians in the United States are against it, except in a few specific areas like Boston. The push for an amendment to make this illegal seems to be motivated by personal religious beliefs, which is not a valid reason for government intervention. I don't see how this would positively impact the economy or society. Therefore, I don't feel it's right for the government to be involved in this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nWell, to begin with, I believe the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, which in reality had little to do with Iraq. They exploited the public's anger and outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally oppose wars, especially preventive ones, and I think the government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the Vietnam War. The war in Iraq, like Vietnam, resulted in a significant loss of American lives and the removal of the Iraqi government. The government seemed unprepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a long, challenging process.\n\nThe government should have planned better for all possible outcomes and prepared for the long-term commitment required to stabilize a post-war country. The U.S. has been in Iraq for several years, and the conflict remains unresolved. I believe the government's initial portrayal of the war was misleading, making it seem like a short, successful campaign. The reality, however, is that establishing democracy is a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have supported George Bush if I could vote, mainly because I wanted him to finish what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult due to the high number of American casualties and the question of how much risk it's worth to establish a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, it's unclear why Iraq was the focus when other countries with similar issues have not been targeted.\n\nThe primary reason for invading Iraq was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. Other nations with confirmed weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, have not been targeted. This raises concerns about the honesty and thoroughness of the government's decision-making process.\n\nI hope the conflict ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm not optimistic about it happening anytime soon.",
            "I'm in favor of gay marriage. I've always held this view. I truly believe it's a personal choice, and research is increasingly suggesting it's more biological than sociological. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to deny people rights over something beyond their control, which seems inhuman to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and the government shouldn't interfere in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who function just like any other family, despite not being married due to the law. I think it's absurd for Bush to try to interpret the definition of marriage according to his beliefs. I've heard and read from many sources that being gay might be predisposed due to brain chemistry, not societal influences. It's just as personal and private as a heterosexual marriage. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to marry, it becomes a public affair. I believe it should be a personal, private matter, not a public or national issue.",
            "When you post something online, you're putting it out in a public forum. Everyone can see it, including people who might not have anything to do with you. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this personally. Once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing dangerous topics like bomb threats or shootings. If you're friends with someone on a social media platform like Myspace, they'll see your posts, and the school might too. If authorities hear about something potentially harmful, they can't ignore it, even if it might just be a joke gone wrong. Once something is online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. People can't control what others think or do with the information they find. While school officials shouldn't be friends with students online, if something dangerous comes to their attention, it's their job to take it seriously. Monitoring private conversations isn't appropriate, but if information is brought to their attention, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake profiles to monitor students, and I, as an R.A., wouldn't friend residents to keep track of their online activities. It's not my responsibility or desired to know what they're doing on social media.",
            "The war seems to have dragged on excessively. Initially, the aim was commendable, with the goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have strayed from this original purpose and are now involved in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. The motives behind the war may have been dubious, possibly influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. At the outset, the war served as a declaration of intent, but the prolonged conflict has blurred that purpose. The war has become an end in itself, and it's unclear if our initial goals were ever achieved. It's been going on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take control of its own affairs. We've been spending billions on this war at the expense of addressing our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own country and not on prolonged wars. It's time to end this conflict and redirect our resources towards our own pressing needs.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that something was prevented because someone found information online about it. Isn't that an invasion of privacy? When you post information on the internet, it's generally available for everyone to see, especially on platforms like Myspace. While you may need to be friends with someone to view their profile, if you give them permission to see it, it means you've accepted that trade-off. Therefore, when you put information online, you should understand that many people will see it. In this case, I believe it was good that someone found the information and prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nHowever, constantly monitoring everyone's profiles is not practical or fair, as it could lead to discrimination. It's important to consider the context in which the profile was found, whether someone was actively looking for evidence or just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that I know there are creepy people who can access my information. I've seen a TV show where a man easily found a girl's screen name and met her in less than a minute. This raises concerns about privacy and the ease with which people can gather personal information. I try to limit what I post, but I also want to maintain my online presence to communicate with friends. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've also heard that in high school, some students were banned from using Myspace by their school, which I found odd. I'm not sure how school officials have the right to restrict students' online activities. It seems like a privacy issue, but I'm not sure about the specifics.",
            "I have a few things to say about the Iraq War, but I feel uncomfortable doing so. I don't want to join those who claim they were against it from the start, as it's not really relevant now. The general consensus, except within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea. Polls show that 75-80% of people worldwide, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. The situation has been a disaster from the beginning and will continue to be so if we stay. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is too great for us to impose our views on them. Saddam was bad, but the potential consequences of invading had to be weighed against the benefits. I don't see any reason for us to stay. The administration may have reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any compelling ones. I'm open to a gradual withdrawal, but I think we should leave now. Eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year. We should respect their wishes. Leaving now would make us the good guys, even if we can't be the heroes we'd like to be.",
            "Yes, I do indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not just about women; it also extends to certain professions and societal expectations. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" where, despite being qualified, they may not be promoted to higher positions due to historical biases that favor men in leadership roles. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home with their children face societal disapproval and are often seen as less capable because of archaic gender roles. In the fashion industry, men are sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously if they're straight, as they're perceived as not understanding fashion from a woman's perspective. Discrimination isn't limited to gender; it also arises from one's background and education level. Ensuring equality is a gradual process, but progress is being made as more women are entering higher positions and societal attitudes are slowly changing. However, rushing these changes would only meet with resistance, so a balanced approach is key.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t make it legal. They decriminalized it, reducing the offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge with potential jail time. If someone gets caught, the penalty is like a citation, not a full arrest. While this change might be beneficial for job applications and other areas where criminal charges can be detrimental, the societal perception of marijuana use and its potential consequences on behavior and lifestyle remain significant concerns. Decriminalization can also save money for local governments by reducing the need for arrests, trials, and incarceration. However, not all communities are willing to make this change, especially those with strong anti-marijuana sentiments. In more liberal places like Denver, decriminalization has been well-received, allowing the city to allocate more funds to education and social programs. While marijuana should not be made readily available like cigarettes, it’s important to consider the potential financial benefits of decriminalization. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects, their impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people may use substances responsibly, while others may not. Therefore, it's difficult to generalize the effects of substances.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nMany of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing these things for a long time\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to have a strong connection to tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible and adapt to change\nUm\nMany Catholics believe they must attend church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey adhere strictly to how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church can be harsh towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't accept people who aren't completely Catholic\nAnd\nThey also don't accept people of other religions\nUm\nFor example\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nMy mother was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my father's religion\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat's not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat's a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it's so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say if one side is correct or incorrect. However, I do think this is the most challenging topic we're currently dealing with. It's difficult to address the separation of church and state and how to define marriage without upsetting someone. I'm not sure whether all civil unions should be seen as marriage, or how the government should classify them. After all, people wouldn't get special treatment or recognition for being married if they were just baptized. Therefore, I believe that couples who are married should be seen as in a civil union. That's what it is - two people united together. So, if all states can agree on a logical approach, they should work towards making it a federal law. However, I think it's ridiculous to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. It's not a pressing enough issue to warrant such a significant change.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so I must admit that the topic of homosexuality is a bit ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, and I feel that the decision should be left to each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nA lot of states are predominantly Democratic, and in these states, there's likely to be support for gay marriage. If you're living in a state that supports it, it's not fair to disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect that.\n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be decided on a state-by-state basis. I don't believe that the current president should be able to impose his views on all the states. Each state should make its own decision, as they will be the ones affected by it.\n\nI don't think it's fair for the president to decide how every state should run, especially since he won't be in office for much longer. If a new president from a different party changes their mind on the issue, it could just go back and forth. Therefore, it's best to leave the decision up to each individual state.",
            "Let's discuss the matter at hand. I don't entirely agree with the notion that Myspace is private. By definition, a bulletin board is meant for public viewing. If a student posts anything on the internet, they should be aware that it's visible to others, including school officials. They have every right to see it, even if it's not posted under the school's name, as they can access it from their personal devices. However, if the purpose is to prevent a school shooting, then I believe it's justified. School officials should only monitor students if they have reason to believe it's for the safety of the students and the school. Constantly monitoring students without cause is an invasion of privacy. I wouldn't expect students to post something with the intent of getting caught, and the same goes for school officials. If they're monitoring to prevent harm or create a safer environment, it's acceptable. However, I don't think it's justifiable to monitor students' online activities to catch them in questionable behaviors. It's important to remember that once something is posted online, it's there forever, and it can come back to haunt them. I believe that the school officials were acting in good faith to ensure the safety of the students and the school.",
            "Initially, I wholeheartedly supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I believed we should retaliate and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, looking back, I think we were driven more by emotions and lacked a clear plan. We went in unprepared and naive about what we would encounter. I'm now firmly against the war as I don't believe we've achieved anything meaningful. The people in the region seem more interested in fighting each other than us, and their war tactics are vastly different from ours. I feel we were more driven by emotion and revenge than strategic planning. The Iraq War was declared partly due to public pressure, and while we didn't have a choice but to react, our approach was flawed. There was no clear objective or unity regarding what we were supposed to achieve. I don't think we can change their culture, and I'm doubtful we'll make enough progress to justify our prolonged presence. We're only hurting ourselves by staying. No, it's time to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. I've heard discussions about their dwindling membership, and I think it's due to their unaccepting stance on many issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their views are strong but somewhat outdated. If they embraced a more modern perspective, they might not face the same loss of followers. People are starting to disagree with the Church's positions on these subjects, causing some to turn away. For instance, if one is pro-choice or supports same-sex marriage, they may not feel comfortable following a church that opposes these views. I don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests, but I'm unsure if these changes would prevent the issues they currently face. The Church's loyalty to God, as they claim, should not preclude them from also having a family life. Everyone else manages to balance work and family life, so I see no reason why priests can't do the same.",
            "I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that sexual orientation isn't something people choose; it's just who they are. People shouldn't be judged or held accountable for it. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't. I think it's wrong for the government to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, I don't think the government should interfere because it's not a matter of national security or moral right. It's not the government's place to dictate who can and can't marry. It's not something that gay people should be penalized for, as it's a part of their nature.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized due to the lack of substantial arguments against it. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but they are different in numerous ways that prevent them from being considered the same. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Numerous civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should be extended to same-sex couples. For instance, a same-sex partner cannot visit or support a sick spouse in the hospital if not deemed \"family.\" I think it's absurd to deny this right to couples who will spend their lives together. Scientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is that people often conflate religious marriage with civil marriage. Same-sex couples are not requesting church ceremonies but rather legal recognition. If civil unions are acceptable, why not marriage? Segregation in the past was \"separate but unequal.\" Same-sex couples form relationships and have the same challenges and triumphs as heterosexual couples. Adoption and community concerns are valid, but evidence shows children are resilient and adaptable. School bullying is more of an issue than the children's upbringing. The federal government should make same-sex marriage legal nationwide. President Bush, influenced by his religious beliefs, opposes it, but moral viewpoints differ among individuals and groups. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country. People often hold negative views of homosexuality due to misconceptions about its origin, but psychological research contradicts these beliefs. People should rely on credible institutions rather than popular opinion to shape their views.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Let me clarify that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. While I believe it should not be available to the general public, it can be used for medicinal purposes. I understand that some illegal drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are beneficial and widely used in pharmacies. Similarly, I think marijuana can be beneficial and used for medical purposes, even though it is illegal. It's important to distinguish that marijuana's illegal status is not a reflection of its intrinsic value or potential benefits. Moreover, I don't believe marijuana is as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. I think it's crucial to remove the negative stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then gradually integrate it into legal frameworks. People should be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than in the past. As a child, I recall dressing up in cute outfits every Sunday when I attended church regularly. Now, I notice a more casual atmosphere, with services lasting only 30 minutes and people wearing beach clothes or jeans and khakis. The church I know has also grown more casual, even during morning masses. However, I don't know the politics of the church, so I can't comment on that.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been avoided by allowing female priests or priests to marry. Pedophilia is often a result of genetics, not marital status. Some men married with children may still be attracted to young kids, and I think the church couldn't have prevented these incidents. If they knew about them and covered them up, that would be wrong, but I don't believe they always did.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but the September 11th attacks had everyone shaken, and I believe we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, with the Bush administration falsely linking the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. This has always bothered me, and it still does. The administration lied to the American people, according to even Colin Powell, who later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented. I believe this is a serious issue and could potentially be an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration disregarded the constitution from the start, with a vengeance-driven agenda against Saddam Hussein, and possibly also aiming to secure more energy resources. Withdrawing now might lead to civil war, but the UN and US's plan to involve neighboring countries doesn't seem reliable in the long run due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the weak, divided interim government. The political process is chaotic, with radical elements vying for control.",

            "I truly don't think it's appropriate for a state to legalize or declare as legal something that the churches themselves should decide on. The Constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and any attempt to enforce rules over this would be a defiance of the constitutional principles. I believe that it's up to the churches to decide on such matters, and not the government. It's important to note that the vast majority of Catholics and Christians in the United States are against it, except in a few specific areas like Boston. The push for an amendment to make this illegal seems to be motivated by personal religious beliefs, which is not a valid reason for government intervention. I don't see how this would positively impact the economy or society. Therefore, I don't feel it's right for the government to be involved in this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nWell, to begin with, I believe the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, which in reality had little to do with Iraq. They exploited the public's anger and outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally oppose wars, especially preventive ones, and I think the government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the Vietnam War. The war in Iraq, like Vietnam, resulted in a significant loss of American lives and the removal of the Iraqi government. The government seemed unprepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a long, challenging process.\n\nThe government should have planned better for all possible outcomes and prepared for the long-term commitment required to stabilize a post-war country. The U.S. has been in Iraq for several years, and the conflict remains unresolved. I believe the government's initial portrayal of the war was misleading, making it seem like a short, successful campaign. The reality, however, is that establishing democracy is a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have supported George Bush if I could vote, mainly because I wanted him to finish what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult due to the high number of American casualties and the question of how much risk it's worth to establish a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, it's unclear why Iraq was the focus when other countries with similar issues have not been targeted.\n\nThe primary reason for invading Iraq was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. Other nations with confirmed weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, have not been targeted. This raises concerns about the honesty and thoroughness of the government's decision-making process.\n\nI hope the conflict ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm not optimistic about it happening anytime soon.",
            "I'm in favor of gay marriage. I've always held this view. I truly believe it's a personal choice, and research is increasingly suggesting it's more biological than sociological. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to deny people rights over something beyond their control, which seems inhuman to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and the government shouldn't interfere in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who function just like any other family, despite not being married due to the law. I think it's absurd for Bush to try to interpret the definition of marriage according to his beliefs. I've heard and read from many sources that being gay might be predisposed due to brain chemistry, not societal influences. It's just as personal and private as a heterosexual marriage. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to marry, it becomes a public affair. I believe it should be a personal, private matter, not a public or national issue.",
            "When you post something online, you're putting it out in a public forum. Everyone can see it, including people who might not have anything to do with you. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this personally. Once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing dangerous topics like bomb threats or shootings. If you're friends with someone on a social media platform like Myspace, they'll see your posts, and the school might too. If authorities hear about something potentially harmful, they can't ignore it, even if it might just be a joke gone wrong. Once something is online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. People can't control what others think or do with the information they find. While school officials shouldn't be friends with students online, if something dangerous comes to their attention, it's their job to take it seriously. Monitoring private conversations isn't appropriate, but if information is brought to their attention, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake profiles to monitor students, and I, as an R.A., wouldn't friend residents to keep track of their online activities. It's not my responsibility or desired to know what they're doing on social media.",
            "The war seems to have dragged on excessively. Initially, the aim was commendable, with the goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have strayed from this original purpose and are now involved in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. The motives behind the war may have been dubious, possibly influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. At the outset, the war served as a declaration of intent, but the prolonged conflict has blurred that purpose. The war has become an end in itself, and it's unclear if our initial goals were ever achieved. It's been going on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take control of its own affairs. We've been spending billions on this war at the expense of addressing our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own country and not on prolonged wars. It's time to end this conflict and redirect our resources towards our own pressing needs.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that something was prevented because someone found information online about it. Isn't that an invasion of privacy? When you post information on the internet, it's generally available for everyone to see, especially on platforms like Myspace. While you may need to be friends with someone to view their profile, if you give them permission to see it, it means you've accepted that trade-off. Therefore, when you put information online, you should understand that many people will see it. In this case, I believe it was good that someone found the information and prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nHowever, constantly monitoring everyone's profiles is not practical or fair, as it could lead to discrimination. It's important to consider the context in which the profile was found, whether someone was actively looking for evidence or just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that I know there are creepy people who can access my information. I've seen a TV show where a man easily found a girl's screen name and met her in less than a minute. This raises concerns about privacy and the ease with which people can gather personal information. I try to limit what I post, but I also want to maintain my online presence to communicate with friends. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've also heard that in high school, some students were banned from using Myspace by their school, which I found odd. I'm not sure how school officials have the right to restrict students' online activities. It seems like a privacy issue, but I'm not sure about the specifics.",
            "I have a few things to say about the Iraq War, but I feel uncomfortable doing so. I don't want to join those who claim they were against it from the start, as it's not really relevant now. The general consensus, except within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea. Polls show that 75-80% of people worldwide, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. The situation has been a disaster from the beginning and will continue to be so if we stay. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is too great for us to impose our views on them. Saddam was bad, but the potential consequences of invading had to be weighed against the benefits. I don't see any reason for us to stay. The administration may have reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any compelling ones. I'm open to a gradual withdrawal, but I think we should leave now. Eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year. We should respect their wishes. Leaving now would make us the good guys, even if we can't be the heroes we'd like to be.",
            "Yes, I do indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not just about women; it also extends to certain professions and societal expectations. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" where, despite being qualified, they may not be promoted to higher positions due to historical biases that favor men in leadership roles. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home with their children face societal disapproval and are often seen as less capable because of archaic gender roles. In the fashion industry, men are sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously if they're straight, as they're perceived as not understanding fashion from a woman's perspective. Discrimination isn't limited to gender; it also arises from one's background and education level. Ensuring equality is a gradual process, but progress is being made as more women are entering higher positions and societal attitudes are slowly changing. However, rushing these changes would only meet with resistance, so a balanced approach is key.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t make it legal. They decriminalized it, reducing the offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge with potential jail time. If someone gets caught, the penalty is like a citation, not a full arrest. While this change might be beneficial for job applications and other areas where criminal charges can be detrimental, the societal perception of marijuana use and its potential consequences on behavior and lifestyle remain significant concerns. Decriminalization can also save money for local governments by reducing the need for arrests, trials, and incarceration. However, not all communities are willing to make this change, especially those with strong anti-marijuana sentiments. In more liberal places like Denver, decriminalization has been well-received, allowing the city to allocate more funds to education and social programs. While marijuana should not be made readily available like cigarettes, it’s important to consider the potential financial benefits of decriminalization. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects, their impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people may use substances responsibly, while others may not. Therefore, it's difficult to generalize the effects of substances.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nMany of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing these things for a long time\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to have a strong connection to tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible and adapt to change\nUm\nMany Catholics believe they must attend church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey adhere strictly to how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church can be harsh towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't accept people who aren't completely Catholic\nAnd\nThey also don't accept people of other religions\nUm\nFor example\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nMy mother was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my father's religion\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat's not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat's a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it's so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say if one side is correct or incorrect. However, I do think this is the most challenging topic we're currently dealing with. It's difficult to address the separation of church and state and how to define marriage without upsetting someone. I'm not sure whether all civil unions should be seen as marriage, or how the government should classify them. After all, people wouldn't get special treatment or recognition for being married if they were just baptized. Therefore, I believe that couples who are married should be seen as in a civil union. That's what it is - two people united together. So, if all states can agree on a logical approach, they should work towards making it a federal law. However, I think it's ridiculous to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. It's not a pressing enough issue to warrant such a significant change.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so I must admit that the topic of homosexuality is a bit ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, and I feel that the decision should be left to each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nA lot of states are predominantly Democratic, and in these states, there's likely to be support for gay marriage. If you're living in a state that supports it, it's not fair to disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect that.\n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be decided on a state-by-state basis. I don't believe that the current president should be able to impose his views on all the states. Each state should make its own decision, as they will be the ones affected by it.\n\nI don't think it's fair for the president to decide how every state should run, especially since he won't be in office for much longer. If a new president from a different party changes their mind on the issue, it could just go back and forth. Therefore, it's best to leave the decision up to each individual state.",
            "Let's discuss the matter at hand. I don't entirely agree with the notion that Myspace is private. By definition, a bulletin board is meant for public viewing. If a student posts anything on the internet, they should be aware that it's visible to others, including school officials. They have every right to see it, even if it's not posted under the school's name, as they can access it from their personal devices. However, if the purpose is to prevent a school shooting, then I believe it's justified. School officials should only monitor students if they have reason to believe it's for the safety of the students and the school. Constantly monitoring students without cause is an invasion of privacy. I wouldn't expect students to post something with the intent of getting caught, and the same goes for school officials. If they're monitoring to prevent harm or create a safer environment, it's acceptable. However, I don't think it's justifiable to monitor students' online activities to catch them in questionable behaviors. It's important to remember that once something is posted online, it's there forever, and it can come back to haunt them. I believe that the school officials were acting in good faith to ensure the safety of the students and the school.",
            "Initially, I wholeheartedly supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I believed we should retaliate and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, looking back, I think we were driven more by emotions and lacked a clear plan. We went in unprepared and naive about what we would encounter. I'm now firmly against the war as I don't believe we've achieved anything meaningful. The people in the region seem more interested in fighting each other than us, and their war tactics are vastly different from ours. I feel we were more driven by emotion and revenge than strategic planning. The Iraq War was declared partly due to public pressure, and while we didn't have a choice but to react, our approach was flawed. There was no clear objective or unity regarding what we were supposed to achieve. I don't think we can change their culture, and I'm doubtful we'll make enough progress to justify our prolonged presence. We're only hurting ourselves by staying. No, it's time to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. There's been talk about their declining membership, and I think it's partly due to their stern views on various issues. For instance, they're not very accepting of same-sex marriage, abortion, or birth control, which can be seen as outdated. If they adopted a more modern mindset, they might not worry about losing followers. Some people are turning away from the Church because of these views, feeling that they're not aligned with their beliefs. For example, someone who supports abortion might struggle to follow a Church that condemns it, and similarly, those who support same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that doesn't agree. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if these changes would significantly alter the situation. The Church's stance on celibacy is quite rigid, but many other professions allow for a balance between work and family life.",
            "I personally don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that the sexual orientation of individuals is not a choice they make, but something they are born with. Therefore, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their orientation. I don't understand why we differentiate between a marriage of a man and a woman, and a marriage of two people of the same sex. It seems to me that the federal government has no business dictating who can or cannot marry, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. People should be free to marry whomever they choose without government interference.",
            "I posit that same-sex marriage should be legalized. The argument against it often centers around the idea that it poses a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this oversimplifies the situation. Same-sex relationships are distinct yet similar in many ways, like two sides of the same coin, where heads and tails are not the same, yet they are part of the same entity. Additionally, there are numerous civil rights associated with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare access, which should not be withheld from same-sex couples.\n\nScientific research has shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is not about the right to marry in a church, but rather the right to a legal marriage certificate issued by the government. This should not be an issue if there is no religious or state involvement. Many people are opposed to same-sex marriage due to moral or religious beliefs, but it's important to consider that morality varies among individuals and cultural groups.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should take a more active role in this issue by legalizing same-sex marriage in every state. The current amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, as it favors one group's religious beliefs over others. Many people view same-sex individuals as psychologically damaged or as a result of childhood trauma, but this is not supported by scientific research. People should rely on well-established institutions and studies, rather than cultural or personal beliefs, to form their opinions on this topic.",
            "Sure, let me start by saying I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. While it's true that some drugs are illegal, that doesn't necessarily mean they have beneficial properties. While I wouldn't advocate for making illegal drugs widely available, I do believe they can be used for medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone and Vicodin, for instance — they're controlled substances we use regularly because they have proven benefits. If we ignore the taboo surrounding marijuana, we could acknowledge and use its benefits responsibly. Marijuana is different from alcohol in that, while both can be abused, marijuana is generally less harmful. I think gradually legalizing marijuana while simultaneously removing the stigma associated with it could be a viable approach. After all, people's perceptions of marijuana are often tainted by its illegal status. If we can change that perception, people might start using marijuana responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adjusted to the 21st century and isn't as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, attending church every Sunday was the norm, and I'd always wear matching outfits with my friends from private school. Now, they have a youth-focused mass that is shorter and more casual, even allowing beach attire on hot summer days. People often arrive late and in informal attire, including jeans and khakis. I'm not knowledgeable about the church's internal politics, but these changes are what I've noticed. Regarding accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I think pedophilia is largely genetic and inherent, not a result of marital status. I believe the church couldn't have prevented these issues had they known and weren't covering up. If they were aware and concealing it, then they should be held accountable. Overall, I don't have any other notable thoughts on the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but as time passed, I believe everyone was still shaken by the September 11th attacks. I think the U.S. invaded Iraq under the pretense of finding weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, but this was later proven incorrect. This misinformation was infuriating to me, and I believe it constituted an impeachable offense. The administration also seemed to have little regard for the Constitution. I also believe that the younger Bush had personal motivations, such as a desire to avenge his father's administration's treatment by Saddam Hussein and to increase energy supplies. I think the war has gone on too long, and while a sudden withdrawal could lead to a civil war, the current situation is not sustainable. The alternative involves a coalition of nearby countries, which may also create more problems in the long run. The interim government seems ineffective, with political instability and radical factions vying for control.",
            "I've been thinking about my stance on the War in Iraq. I'm not really an expert on the topic, but at this point, I feel like it's more of a retaliation rather than a proper war. We invaded because we suspected Iraq was involved in 9/11, but there's no official declaration of war from Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq because I don't follow its progress closely. However, I believe we're there to try and build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's worth the ongoing conflict and resources we're investing. It's like a never-ending cycle where we can't leave without causing further instability, and even if we stay, creating democracy will take ages. It's a tough situation. I feel bad for the families whose loved ones are in Iraq, but we also need to consider the cultural differences and how our presence might make things worse. It's a complex issue that might continue for many years.",
            "I don't believe it's appropriate for a state to legalize this or for the government to declare it legal. I think it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the Constitution establishes a clear separation of church and state. Enforcing any laws on this would be contrary to the principles already laid out in our Constitution. I don't think it's fair for the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, which promotes religious tolerance. I don't think any amendment on this topic would be appropriate or in line with our existing laws. It would likely be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the president is pushing for this amendment, other than his personal beliefs as a Catholic. This is a clear case of favoring one religion over others. It's not the president's or any government official's place to decide this; it's the churches' call. There's no valid reason for this amendment other than personal beliefs, and I don't see how it would impact the economy in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, the government was not entirely honest with the American people regarding the reasons for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. They attempted to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government played on the public's outrage and emotions following the 2001 attacks to justify the invasion. I personally am against preemptive strikes, and I believe the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes. The US removed the Iraqi government without a clear plan for the aftermath, leading to chaos and a prolonged conflict. The US government failed to adequately prepare for these challenges and underestimated the difficulty of establishing a democratic government in Iraq. The war has resulted in many American casualties and continues to be a controversial topic. The decision to remove the Iraqi government was likely influenced by the desire to control oil resources. The lack of immediate success in Iraq is a reminder that establishing democracy is a difficult and lengthy process. The war is a complex issue with no easy solution.",
            "I strongly support same-sex marriage; I've always held this belief. I believe it's a personal preference, and recent scientific research suggests it has biological, rather than societal, roots. I find it unfair to deny people rights over something they have no control over. Moreover, I think it's inhumane. I've consistently advocated for same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should interfere in this matter. It's a personal and household issue, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and function just like any other family. The current administration's attempt to reinterpret the definition of marriage is absurd.\n\nIn terms of studies and reports, there's evidence suggesting sexual orientation may be predetermined biologically, rather than due to upbringing. Additionally, while straight couples can marry privately, same-sex couples' weddings often become public events. I believe marriage should be a personal, private matter, not one that involves the government or public domain.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public, reachable by anyone. As a Resident Assistant, I've encountered this directly. Anything you post online can influence how others perceive you, especially regarding sensitive or dangerous topics like violence. If you share something that raises alarm bells, it may reach authorities, who must take it seriously. However, not everything online should be taken at face value - some posts are just jokes, experiments, or private. If you don't want something to be seen, it shouldn't be shared online. It's important to remember that administrators have access to relevant information only if it's brought to their attention for a valid reason, such as a potential threat. They shouldn't snoop through social media accounts, but if they receive credible information, they must act. It's not appropriate for teachers to create fake profiles to monitor students, and likewise, I wouldn't want residents to share their personal lives with me. The key is to avoid sharing sensitive information publicly or allowing it to be shared with unintended audiences.",
            "I believe the war has dragged on for too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I think we've lost sight of this purpose, and now we may be fighting just to assert our power. The original motivations might have been tainted by personal grudges from previous conflicts. If the intended purpose was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been justifiable; however, any personal motives would not have been fair. I think we achieved our initial goal quickly at the beginning of the war, but the conflict has persisted for years, outlasting its initial purpose. The war has become a power play, and we're reluctant to end it without a clear victory. It has dragged on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over. We're wasting billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and domestic issues such as poverty and healthcare are suffering. Our resources should be focused on addressing these problems instead of an endless foreign conflict.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this?\n\nIt seems the issue was avoided because someone found out online, likely on a site like Myspace, that something was going on. My understanding is that on platforms like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's visible to everyone, either directly or through friends/followers. It's like giving permission for someone to view your profile.\n\nIf this someone was trying to prevent a tragedy, it's a tough situation. While it's not feasible for one person to constantly monitor every student's profile, I worry about the potential for discrimination if they focus only on \"bad kids.\" It's also unclear whether someone was monitoring profiles randomly or looking for specific information.\n\nI myself don't use Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm aware that there are people who can see information about me, which can be creepy. I've seen examples where people have used this to try to contact me or others, sometimes without their consent.\n\nIt's a tricky balance because I use social media to connect with friends, but I also want to protect my privacy. I only accept friend requests from people I know. It's difficult, as you can never be sure who might see what you post.\n\nI've heard that in some schools, students were banned from using Myspace, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I question whether schools have the right to control students' online activities.",
            "I find it difficult to discuss the Iraq War as I feel it's not something I should be talking about. I was opposed to it from the start, but now it seems like most people believe it was a mistake, except for the administration. The polls conducted show that the vast majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis and U.S. troops, think it was a bad idea and that we should leave within a year. The situation in Iraq has been a mess since we arrived, and pulling out will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it hard for the administration to understand the region and impose democracy where it doesn't belong. Saddam was indeed a bad leader, but the risks of invasion should have been weighed carefully. I'm struggling to find a reason to stay, and the administration hasn't provided any legitimate reasons to remain. Asking the Iraqis if we should leave and respecting their decision could help us avoid blame if things go wrong. At least, we would be the \"good guys\" for wanting to help, even if we never truly are in the Middle East. I don't believe we can do much good there anymore, and staying might be worse than leaving.",
            "I indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. While it's not just about women, certain industries and societal expectations can make it more challenging for individuals to break through barriers. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" in the workplace, where even qualified candidates might be overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. Similarly, men in fields like fashion face skepticism because of societal stereotypes that equate fashion with femininity. Moreover, stay-at-home fathers often encounter disapproval, with society expecting men to be the primary breadwinners. These issues highlight the need for gradual societal shifts. While progress is being made, such as women advancing to higher positions and men taking on more domestic roles, change takes time. To foster acceptance, we must highlight the positive qualities of these individuals without being too forceful. I believe we're at a critical point where such changes are becoming more normalized. Furthermore, discrimination can exist among men based on their background or grammar skills, indicating that bias can manifest in various forms.",
            "My interpretation is that they haven't legalized it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's now treated more like a traffic violation than a criminal offense, resulting in citations instead of arrests and legal proceedings. While decriminalization might mitigate some of the most severe future consequences, like those related to job applications, it doesn't entirely eliminate them. Additionally, the process of arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals is expensive for municipalities, which is why some may not decriminalize it despite potential financial benefits. For instance, Denver, known for its more liberal stance, has seen financial advantages from decriminalization, allowing for increased funding in public education and social programs. However, the widespread presence of marijuana is still considered taboo in many contexts, and its impact on lifestyle can be detrimental. While both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, they affect individuals differently. Some people may react moderately, while others can be more impulsive. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize the impact of these substances across all users.",

I'm unsure if marriage should be defined by the government, as it's a sacred union. I think it should be treated as a civil union, regardless of whether it's a religious ceremony or not.

            "Um\nNo, not at all\nUm\nLet's see, I\nI reckon\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know\nIf you look up the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s essentially posting for everyone to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou have to realize that people will see it\nWhether they’re school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my view, I feel the school officials had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t under the school’s name\nThey could still access it\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is the responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they shouldn’t\nThey go on there just to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something negative about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd  know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd  know\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd  well that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was supportive of the war due to the personal impact of nine eleven on me. I was eager to retaliate, but now I strongly oppose it. I think we were driven by emotion and did not consider the long-term consequences. We were ill-prepared and lacked a clear plan. I believe the war backfired on us. I'm now indifferent towards the people over there, as I don't think they can get along with each other let alone with us. I don't believe our presence will make a difference if they can't even peacefully coexist. I think we should withdraw and let them sort out their own issues. I feel we were too emotionally charged and not rational in our approach. I believe the initial decision to invade Iraq was more about revenge than strategy. We lacked a clear plan for order and rebuilding, and we didn't consider the cultural differences in warfare. I don't think we have the capability or right to change those people. I'm skeptical about the progress made and believe that our presence is not beneficial. We can't stay there forever, and I think withdrawing would be in our best interest."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. There's been talk about their declining membership, and I think it's partly due to their stern views on various issues. For instance, they're not very accepting of same-sex marriage, abortion, or birth control, which can be seen as outdated. If they adopted a more modern mindset, they might not worry about losing followers. Some people are turning away from the Church because of these views, feeling that they're not aligned with their beliefs. For example, someone who supports abortion might struggle to follow a Church that condemns it, and similarly, those who support same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that doesn't agree. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if these changes would significantly alter the situation. The Church's stance on celibacy is quite rigid, but many other professions allow for a balance between work and family life.",
            "I personally don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that the sexual orientation of individuals is not a choice they make, but something they are born with. Therefore, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their orientation. I don't understand why we differentiate between a marriage of a man and a woman, and a marriage of two people of the same sex. It seems to me that the federal government has no business dictating who can or cannot marry, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. People should be free to marry whomever they choose without government interference.",
            "I posit that same-sex marriage should be legalized. The argument against it often centers around the idea that it poses a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this oversimplifies the situation. Same-sex relationships are distinct yet similar in many ways, like two sides of the same coin, where heads and tails are not the same, yet they are part of the same entity. Additionally, there are numerous civil rights associated with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare access, which should not be withheld from same-sex couples.\n\nScientific research has shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is not about the right to marry in a church, but rather the right to a legal marriage certificate issued by the government. This should not be an issue if there is no religious or state involvement. Many people are opposed to same-sex marriage due to moral or religious beliefs, but it's important to consider that morality varies among individuals and cultural groups.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should take a more active role in this issue by legalizing same-sex marriage in every state. The current amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, as it favors one group's religious beliefs over others. Many people view same-sex individuals as psychologically damaged or as a result of childhood trauma, but this is not supported by scientific research. People should rely on well-established institutions and studies, rather than cultural or personal beliefs, to form their opinions on this topic.",
            "Sure, let me start by saying I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. While it's true that some drugs are illegal, that doesn't necessarily mean they have beneficial properties. While I wouldn't advocate for making illegal drugs widely available, I do believe they can be used for medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone and Vicodin, for instance — they're controlled substances we use regularly because they have proven benefits. If we ignore the taboo surrounding marijuana, we could acknowledge and use its benefits responsibly. Marijuana is different from alcohol in that, while both can be abused, marijuana is generally less harmful. I think gradually legalizing marijuana while simultaneously removing the stigma associated with it could be a viable approach. After all, people's perceptions of marijuana are often tainted by its illegal status. If we can change that perception, people might start using marijuana responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adjusted to the 21st century and isn't as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, attending church every Sunday was the norm, and I'd always wear matching outfits with my friends from private school. Now, they have a youth-focused mass that is shorter and more casual, even allowing beach attire on hot summer days. People often arrive late and in informal attire, including jeans and khakis. I'm not knowledgeable about the church's internal politics, but these changes are what I've noticed. Regarding accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I think pedophilia is largely genetic and inherent, not a result of marital status. I believe the church couldn't have prevented these issues had they known and weren't covering up. If they were aware and concealing it, then they should be held accountable. Overall, I don't have any other notable thoughts on the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but as time passed, I believe everyone was still shaken by the September 11th attacks. I think the U.S. invaded Iraq under the pretense of finding weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, but this was later proven incorrect. This misinformation was infuriating to me, and I believe it constituted an impeachable offense. The administration also seemed to have little regard for the Constitution. I also believe that the younger Bush had personal motivations, such as a desire to avenge his father's administration's treatment by Saddam Hussein and to increase energy supplies. I think the war has gone on too long, and while a sudden withdrawal could lead to a civil war, the current situation is not sustainable. The alternative involves a coalition of nearby countries, which may also create more problems in the long run. The interim government seems ineffective, with political instability and radical factions vying for control.",
            "I've been thinking about my stance on the War in Iraq. I'm not really an expert on the topic, but at this point, I feel like it's more of a retaliation rather than a proper war. We invaded because we suspected Iraq was involved in 9/11, but there's no official declaration of war from Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq because I don't follow its progress closely. However, I believe we're there to try and build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's worth the ongoing conflict and resources we're investing. It's like a never-ending cycle where we can't leave without causing further instability, and even if we stay, creating democracy will take ages. It's a tough situation. I feel bad for the families whose loved ones are in Iraq, but we also need to consider the cultural differences and how our presence might make things worse. It's a complex issue that might continue for many years.",
            "I don't believe it's appropriate for a state to legalize this or for the government to declare it legal. I think it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the Constitution establishes a clear separation of church and state. Enforcing any laws on this would be contrary to the principles already laid out in our Constitution. I don't think it's fair for the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, which promotes religious tolerance. I don't think any amendment on this topic would be appropriate or in line with our existing laws. It would likely be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the president is pushing for this amendment, other than his personal beliefs as a Catholic. This is a clear case of favoring one religion over others. It's not the president's or any government official's place to decide this; it's the churches' call. There's no valid reason for this amendment other than personal beliefs, and I don't see how it would impact the economy in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, the government was not entirely honest with the American people regarding the reasons for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. They attempted to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government played on the public's outrage and emotions following the 2001 attacks to justify the invasion. I personally am against preemptive strikes, and I believe the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes. The US removed the Iraqi government without a clear plan for the aftermath, leading to chaos and a prolonged conflict. The US government failed to adequately prepare for these challenges and underestimated the difficulty of establishing a democratic government in Iraq. The war has resulted in many American casualties and continues to be a controversial topic. The decision to remove the Iraqi government was likely influenced by the desire to control oil resources. The lack of immediate success in Iraq is a reminder that establishing democracy is a difficult and lengthy process. The war is a complex issue with no easy solution.",
            "I strongly support same-sex marriage; I've always held this belief. I believe it's a personal preference, and recent scientific research suggests it has biological, rather than societal, roots. I find it unfair to deny people rights over something they have no control over. Moreover, I think it's inhumane. I've consistently advocated for same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should interfere in this matter. It's a personal and household issue, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and function just like any other family. The current administration's attempt to reinterpret the definition of marriage is absurd.\n\nIn terms of studies and reports, there's evidence suggesting sexual orientation may be predetermined biologically, rather than due to upbringing. Additionally, while straight couples can marry privately, same-sex couples' weddings often become public events. I believe marriage should be a personal, private matter, not one that involves the government or public domain.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public, reachable by anyone. As a Resident Assistant, I've encountered this directly. Anything you post online can influence how others perceive you, especially regarding sensitive or dangerous topics like violence. If you share something that raises alarm bells, it may reach authorities, who must take it seriously. However, not everything online should be taken at face value - some posts are just jokes, experiments, or private. If you don't want something to be seen, it shouldn't be shared online. It's important to remember that administrators have access to relevant information only if it's brought to their attention for a valid reason, such as a potential threat. They shouldn't snoop through social media accounts, but if they receive credible information, they must act. It's not appropriate for teachers to create fake profiles to monitor students, and likewise, I wouldn't want residents to share their personal lives with me. The key is to avoid sharing sensitive information publicly or allowing it to be shared with unintended audiences.",
            "I believe the war has dragged on for too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I think we've lost sight of this purpose, and now we may be fighting just to assert our power. The original motivations might have been tainted by personal grudges from previous conflicts. If the intended purpose was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been justifiable; however, any personal motives would not have been fair. I think we achieved our initial goal quickly at the beginning of the war, but the conflict has persisted for years, outlasting its initial purpose. The war has become a power play, and we're reluctant to end it without a clear victory. It has dragged on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over. We're wasting billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and domestic issues such as poverty and healthcare are suffering. Our resources should be focused on addressing these problems instead of an endless foreign conflict.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this?\n\nIt seems the issue was avoided because someone found out online, likely on a site like Myspace, that something was going on. My understanding is that on platforms like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's visible to everyone, either directly or through friends/followers. It's like giving permission for someone to view your profile.\n\nIf this someone was trying to prevent a tragedy, it's a tough situation. While it's not feasible for one person to constantly monitor every student's profile, I worry about the potential for discrimination if they focus only on \"bad kids.\" It's also unclear whether someone was monitoring profiles randomly or looking for specific information.\n\nI myself don't use Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm aware that there are people who can see information about me, which can be creepy. I've seen examples where people have used this to try to contact me or others, sometimes without their consent.\n\nIt's a tricky balance because I use social media to connect with friends, but I also want to protect my privacy. I only accept friend requests from people I know. It's difficult, as you can never be sure who might see what you post.\n\nI've heard that in some schools, students were banned from using Myspace, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I question whether schools have the right to control students' online activities.",
            "I find it difficult to discuss the Iraq War as I feel it's not something I should be talking about. I was opposed to it from the start, but now it seems like most people believe it was a mistake, except for the administration. The polls conducted show that the vast majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis and U.S. troops, think it was a bad idea and that we should leave within a year. The situation in Iraq has been a mess since we arrived, and pulling out will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it hard for the administration to understand the region and impose democracy where it doesn't belong. Saddam was indeed a bad leader, but the risks of invasion should have been weighed carefully. I'm struggling to find a reason to stay, and the administration hasn't provided any legitimate reasons to remain. Asking the Iraqis if we should leave and respecting their decision could help us avoid blame if things go wrong. At least, we would be the \"good guys\" for wanting to help, even if we never truly are in the Middle East. I don't believe we can do much good there anymore, and staying might be worse than leaving.",
            "I indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. While it's not just about women, certain industries and societal expectations can make it more challenging for individuals to break through barriers. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" in the workplace, where even qualified candidates might be overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. Similarly, men in fields like fashion face skepticism because of societal stereotypes that equate fashion with femininity. Moreover, stay-at-home fathers often encounter disapproval, with society expecting men to be the primary breadwinners. These issues highlight the need for gradual societal shifts. While progress is being made, such as women advancing to higher positions and men taking on more domestic roles, change takes time. To foster acceptance, we must highlight the positive qualities of these individuals without being too forceful. I believe we're at a critical point where such changes are becoming more normalized. Furthermore, discrimination can exist among men based on their background or grammar skills, indicating that bias can manifest in various forms.",
            "My interpretation is that they haven't legalized it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's now treated more like a traffic violation than a criminal offense, resulting in citations instead of arrests and legal proceedings. While decriminalization might mitigate some of the most severe future consequences, like those related to job applications, it doesn't entirely eliminate them. Additionally, the process of arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals is expensive for municipalities, which is why some may not decriminalize it despite potential financial benefits. For instance, Denver, known for its more liberal stance, has seen financial advantages from decriminalization, allowing for increased funding in public education and social programs. However, the widespread presence of marijuana is still considered taboo in many contexts, and its impact on lifestyle can be detrimental. While both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, they affect individuals differently. Some people may react moderately, while others can be more impulsive. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize the impact of these substances across all users.",

I'm unsure if marriage should be defined by the government, as it's a sacred union. I think it should be treated as a civil union, regardless of whether it's a religious ceremony or not.

            "Um\nNo, not at all\nUm\nLet's see, I\nI reckon\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know\nIf you look up the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s essentially posting for everyone to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou have to realize that people will see it\nWhether they’re school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my view, I feel the school officials had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t under the school’s name\nThey could still access it\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is the responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they shouldn’t\nThey go on there just to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something negative about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd  know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd  know\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd  well that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was supportive of the war due to the personal impact of nine eleven on me. I was eager to retaliate, but now I strongly oppose it. I think we were driven by emotion and did not consider the long-term consequences. We were ill-prepared and lacked a clear plan. I believe the war backfired on us. I'm now indifferent towards the people over there, as I don't think they can get along with each other let alone with us. I don't believe our presence will make a difference if they can't even peacefully coexist. I think we should withdraw and let them sort out their own issues. I feel we were too emotionally charged and not rational in our approach. I believe the initial decision to invade Iraq was more about revenge than strategy. We lacked a clear plan for order and rebuilding, and we didn't consider the cultural differences in warfare. I don't think we have the capability or right to change those people. I'm skeptical about the progress made and believe that our presence is not beneficial. We can't stay there forever, and I think withdrawing would be in our best interest."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. There's been talk about their declining membership, and I think it's partly due to their stern views on various issues. For instance, they're not very accepting of same-sex marriage, abortion, or birth control, which can be seen as outdated. If they adopted a more modern mindset, they might not worry about losing followers. Some people are turning away from the Church because of these views, feeling that they're not aligned with their beliefs. For example, someone who supports abortion might struggle to follow a Church that condemns it, and similarly, those who support same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in a community that doesn't agree. I don't see any reason why women can't be priests or why priests can't be married, but I'm not sure if these changes would significantly alter the situation. The Church's stance on celibacy is quite rigid, but many other professions allow for a balance between work and family life.",
            "I personally don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that the sexual orientation of individuals is not a choice they make, but something they are born with. Therefore, I think it's unfair to hold gay people responsible for their orientation. I don't understand why we differentiate between a marriage of a man and a woman, and a marriage of two people of the same sex. It seems to me that the federal government has no business dictating who can or cannot marry, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. People should be free to marry whomever they choose without government interference.",
            "I posit that same-sex marriage should be legalized. The argument against it often centers around the idea that it poses a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this oversimplifies the situation. Same-sex relationships are distinct yet similar in many ways, like two sides of the same coin, where heads and tails are not the same, yet they are part of the same entity. Additionally, there are numerous civil rights associated with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare access, which should not be withheld from same-sex couples.\n\nScientific research has shown that same-sex couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is not about the right to marry in a church, but rather the right to a legal marriage certificate issued by the government. This should not be an issue if there is no religious or state involvement. Many people are opposed to same-sex marriage due to moral or religious beliefs, but it's important to consider that morality varies among individuals and cultural groups.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should take a more active role in this issue by legalizing same-sex marriage in every state. The current amendment banning gay marriage is hypocritical, as it favors one group's religious beliefs over others. Many people view same-sex individuals as psychologically damaged or as a result of childhood trauma, but this is not supported by scientific research. People should rely on well-established institutions and studies, rather than cultural or personal beliefs, to form their opinions on this topic.",
            "Sure, let me start by saying I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. While it's true that some drugs are illegal, that doesn't necessarily mean they have beneficial properties. While I wouldn't advocate for making illegal drugs widely available, I do believe they can be used for medicinal purposes. Take oxycodone and Vicodin, for instance — they're controlled substances we use regularly because they have proven benefits. If we ignore the taboo surrounding marijuana, we could acknowledge and use its benefits responsibly. Marijuana is different from alcohol in that, while both can be abused, marijuana is generally less harmful. I think gradually legalizing marijuana while simultaneously removing the stigma associated with it could be a viable approach. After all, people's perceptions of marijuana are often tainted by its illegal status. If we can change that perception, people might start using marijuana responsibly, especially for medicinal purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adjusted to the 21st century and isn't as rigid as it once was. When I was younger, attending church every Sunday was the norm, and I'd always wear matching outfits with my friends from private school. Now, they have a youth-focused mass that is shorter and more casual, even allowing beach attire on hot summer days. People often arrive late and in informal attire, including jeans and khakis. I'm not knowledgeable about the church's internal politics, but these changes are what I've noticed. Regarding accusations against Catholic priests involving pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or married priests. I think pedophilia is largely genetic and inherent, not a result of marital status. I believe the church couldn't have prevented these issues had they known and weren't covering up. If they were aware and concealing it, then they should be held accountable. Overall, I don't have any other notable thoughts on the Catholic Church.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but as time passed, I believe everyone was still shaken by the September 11th attacks. I think the U.S. invaded Iraq under the pretense of finding weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the attacks, but this was later proven incorrect. This misinformation was infuriating to me, and I believe it constituted an impeachable offense. The administration also seemed to have little regard for the Constitution. I also believe that the younger Bush had personal motivations, such as a desire to avenge his father's administration's treatment by Saddam Hussein and to increase energy supplies. I think the war has gone on too long, and while a sudden withdrawal could lead to a civil war, the current situation is not sustainable. The alternative involves a coalition of nearby countries, which may also create more problems in the long run. The interim government seems ineffective, with political instability and radical factions vying for control.",
            "I've been thinking about my stance on the War in Iraq. I'm not really an expert on the topic, but at this point, I feel like it's more of a retaliation rather than a proper war. We invaded because we suspected Iraq was involved in 9/11, but there's no official declaration of war from Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq because I don't follow its progress closely. However, I believe we're there to try and build democracy and secure oil resources. I don't think it's worth the ongoing conflict and resources we're investing. It's like a never-ending cycle where we can't leave without causing further instability, and even if we stay, creating democracy will take ages. It's a tough situation. I feel bad for the families whose loved ones are in Iraq, but we also need to consider the cultural differences and how our presence might make things worse. It's a complex issue that might continue for many years.",
            "I don't believe it's appropriate for a state to legalize this or for the government to declare it legal. I think it's a matter that should be left to the churches, as the Constitution establishes a clear separation of church and state. Enforcing any laws on this would be contrary to the principles already laid out in our Constitution. I don't think it's fair for the government to decide what churches can and cannot make illegal, as most Catholics and Christians oppose it. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, which promotes religious tolerance. I don't think any amendment on this topic would be appropriate or in line with our existing laws. It would likely be one of the few amendments used to restrict the people rather than the government. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. I don't understand why the president is pushing for this amendment, other than his personal beliefs as a Catholic. This is a clear case of favoring one religion over others. It's not the president's or any government official's place to decide this; it's the churches' call. There's no valid reason for this amendment other than personal beliefs, and I don't see how it would impact the economy in a negative way. In fact, it might even have a positive impact on society. I've said it all.",
            "The war in Iraq\nWell, the government was not entirely honest with the American people regarding the reasons for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. They attempted to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which was largely unfounded. The government played on the public's outrage and emotions following the 2001 attacks to justify the invasion. I personally am against preemptive strikes, and I believe the war in Iraq is a repeat of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes. The US removed the Iraqi government without a clear plan for the aftermath, leading to chaos and a prolonged conflict. The US government failed to adequately prepare for these challenges and underestimated the difficulty of establishing a democratic government in Iraq. The war has resulted in many American casualties and continues to be a controversial topic. The decision to remove the Iraqi government was likely influenced by the desire to control oil resources. The lack of immediate success in Iraq is a reminder that establishing democracy is a difficult and lengthy process. The war is a complex issue with no easy solution.",
            "I strongly support same-sex marriage; I've always held this belief. I believe it's a personal preference, and recent scientific research suggests it has biological, rather than societal, roots. I find it unfair to deny people rights over something they have no control over. Moreover, I think it's inhumane. I've consistently advocated for same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think politics or the government should interfere in this matter. It's a personal and household issue, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and function just like any other family. The current administration's attempt to reinterpret the definition of marriage is absurd.\n\nIn terms of studies and reports, there's evidence suggesting sexual orientation may be predetermined biologically, rather than due to upbringing. Additionally, while straight couples can marry privately, same-sex couples' weddings often become public events. I believe marriage should be a personal, private matter, not one that involves the government or public domain.",
            "When you share something online, it becomes public, reachable by anyone. As a Resident Assistant, I've encountered this directly. Anything you post online can influence how others perceive you, especially regarding sensitive or dangerous topics like violence. If you share something that raises alarm bells, it may reach authorities, who must take it seriously. However, not everything online should be taken at face value - some posts are just jokes, experiments, or private. If you don't want something to be seen, it shouldn't be shared online. It's important to remember that administrators have access to relevant information only if it's brought to their attention for a valid reason, such as a potential threat. They shouldn't snoop through social media accounts, but if they receive credible information, they must act. It's not appropriate for teachers to create fake profiles to monitor students, and likewise, I wouldn't want residents to share their personal lives with me. The key is to avoid sharing sensitive information publicly or allowing it to be shared with unintended audiences.",
            "I believe the war has dragged on for too long. Initially, the goal was noble, aiming to restore democracy in another country. However, I think we've lost sight of this purpose, and now we may be fighting just to assert our power. The original motivations might have been tainted by personal grudges from previous conflicts. If the intended purpose was to bring democracy to a country with an unfair political system, that would have been justifiable; however, any personal motives would not have been fair. I think we achieved our initial goal quickly at the beginning of the war, but the conflict has persisted for years, outlasting its initial purpose. The war has become a power play, and we're reluctant to end it without a clear victory. It has dragged on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take over. We're wasting billions of dollars on this war while our own economy and domestic issues such as poverty and healthcare are suffering. Our resources should be focused on addressing these problems instead of an endless foreign conflict.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify this?\n\nIt seems the issue was avoided because someone found out online, likely on a site like Myspace, that something was going on. My understanding is that on platforms like Myspace, if you post personal information, it's visible to everyone, either directly or through friends/followers. It's like giving permission for someone to view your profile.\n\nIf this someone was trying to prevent a tragedy, it's a tough situation. While it's not feasible for one person to constantly monitor every student's profile, I worry about the potential for discrimination if they focus only on \"bad kids.\" It's also unclear whether someone was monitoring profiles randomly or looking for specific information.\n\nI myself don't use Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm aware that there are people who can see information about me, which can be creepy. I've seen examples where people have used this to try to contact me or others, sometimes without their consent.\n\nIt's a tricky balance because I use social media to connect with friends, but I also want to protect my privacy. I only accept friend requests from people I know. It's difficult, as you can never be sure who might see what you post.\n\nI've heard that in some schools, students were banned from using Myspace, which I found a bit strange. I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, but I question whether schools have the right to control students' online activities.",
            "I find it difficult to discuss the Iraq War as I feel it's not something I should be talking about. I was opposed to it from the start, but now it seems like most people believe it was a mistake, except for the administration. The polls conducted show that the vast majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis and U.S. troops, think it was a bad idea and that we should leave within a year. The situation in Iraq has been a mess since we arrived, and pulling out will also be challenging. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it hard for the administration to understand the region and impose democracy where it doesn't belong. Saddam was indeed a bad leader, but the risks of invasion should have been weighed carefully. I'm struggling to find a reason to stay, and the administration hasn't provided any legitimate reasons to remain. Asking the Iraqis if we should leave and respecting their decision could help us avoid blame if things go wrong. At least, we would be the \"good guys\" for wanting to help, even if we never truly are in the Middle East. I don't believe we can do much good there anymore, and staying might be worse than leaving.",
            "I indeed believe that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. While it's not just about women, certain industries and societal expectations can make it more challenging for individuals to break through barriers. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" in the workplace, where even qualified candidates might be overlooked for promotions due to historical biases. Similarly, men in fields like fashion face skepticism because of societal stereotypes that equate fashion with femininity. Moreover, stay-at-home fathers often encounter disapproval, with society expecting men to be the primary breadwinners. These issues highlight the need for gradual societal shifts. While progress is being made, such as women advancing to higher positions and men taking on more domestic roles, change takes time. To foster acceptance, we must highlight the positive qualities of these individuals without being too forceful. I believe we're at a critical point where such changes are becoming more normalized. Furthermore, discrimination can exist among men based on their background or grammar skills, indicating that bias can manifest in various forms.",
            "My interpretation is that they haven't legalized it, but rather decriminalized it. This means it's now treated more like a traffic violation than a criminal offense, resulting in citations instead of arrests and legal proceedings. While decriminalization might mitigate some of the most severe future consequences, like those related to job applications, it doesn't entirely eliminate them. Additionally, the process of arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals is expensive for municipalities, which is why some may not decriminalize it despite potential financial benefits. For instance, Denver, known for its more liberal stance, has seen financial advantages from decriminalization, allowing for increased funding in public education and social programs. However, the widespread presence of marijuana is still considered taboo in many contexts, and its impact on lifestyle can be detrimental. While both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, they affect individuals differently. Some people may react moderately, while others can be more impulsive. Therefore, it's challenging to generalize the impact of these substances across all users.",

I'm unsure if marriage should be defined by the government, as it's a sacred union. I think it should be treated as a civil union, regardless of whether it's a religious ceremony or not.

            "Um\nNo, not at all\nUm\nLet's see, I\nI reckon\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin board\nYou know\nIf you look up the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s essentially posting for everyone to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou have to realize that people will see it\nWhether they’re school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my view, I feel the school officials had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t under the school’s name\nThey could still access it\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is the responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff they shouldn’t\nThey go on there just to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something negative about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd  know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd  know\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd  well that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Initially, I was supportive of the war due to the personal impact of nine eleven on me. I was eager to retaliate, but now I strongly oppose it. I think we were driven by emotion and did not consider the long-term consequences. We were ill-prepared and lacked a clear plan. I believe the war backfired on us. I'm now indifferent towards the people over there, as I don't think they can get along with each other let alone with us. I don't believe our presence will make a difference if they can't even peacefully coexist. I think we should withdraw and let them sort out their own issues. I feel we were too emotionally charged and not rational in our approach. I believe the initial decision to invade Iraq was more about revenge than strategy. We lacked a clear plan for order and rebuilding, and we didn't consider the cultural differences in warfare. I don't think we have the capability or right to change those people. I'm skeptical about the progress made and believe that our presence is not beneficial. We can't stay there forever, and I think withdrawing would be in our best interest."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While it has strong views on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is understandable, these views can seem outdated to some. I think adapting to more modern perspectives might help prevent the loss of followers. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which can make them uncomfortable. For instance, those who support abortion or same-sex marriage might not be comfortable in a faith that considers these practices wrong. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past scandals. The Church argues that priests are married to God, but this doesn't preclude them from having family lives like other professionals.",
            "I personally am not against gay marriage. I believe that being gay is not a choice that someone makes consciously. People shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from getting married. I don't think it's a choice that someone makes and it's not something that the federal government should be involved in, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's simply who they are, and they shouldn't be punished or discriminated against for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a compelling reason to keep it illegal. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is an oversimplification as there are many distinct aspects to these relationships. They can be compared to two sides of the same coin; while they differ in aspects, the essence is the same. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage would entail similar civil rights, such as property rights and healthcare provisions for partners, which are currently limited.\n\nScientific studies show that homosexual couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates and child-rearing skills as heterosexual couples. The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding of what gay marriage actually is; it is a legal document from the government, not a religious ceremony. Allowing civil unions while denying marriage is akin to segregation. Furthermore, concerns about adoption and community issues are unfounded, as the issues are more about societal perceptions and treatment of children than about their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states, amending the constitution to reflect this. However, I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the matter, as his views are influenced by his religious beliefs. Most reasons for opposition are moral, but morality varies greatly among individuals and shouldn't be imposed on the entire population. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring other cultural and moral concepts.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about the psychological makeup of homosexuals, but these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Let me clarify something: The fact that a drug is illegal doesn't inherently make it beneficial. While I don't advocate for making such drugs available to the general public, I believe they can be used medicinally. I've seen this with controlled substances like oxycotton, Vicodin, and Percocets. The point is, it's not about the drug's legality, but about its benefits. Regarding marijuana, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol because it's not as harmful as harder drugs. I wouldn't rush to legalize it all at once, but rather gradually, and only after removing the negative stigma surrounding it. People would be more likely to use it responsibly once they see it differently.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less stringent than it once was. When I was young, I used to go to church every Sunday, always dressed in matching outfits with my friends from my private school. Now, the church offers teenage masses that are shorter and more casual, with people dressing more relaxed, even in summer. I've noticed that the church has become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis to morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe pedophilia is a genetic condition that cannot be cured by marital status. I think if a priest wants to marry but also practice their faith, they should consider another religion.",
            "Initially, the idea of the Iraq war was acceptable, but considering the heightened emotions and concerns following the September 11th attacks, I believe the U.S. went to war, in part, based on false pretexts that the administration used to justify their actions. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein's regime with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. This has always troubled me, as it seems like the administration deliberately misled the American public.\n\nColin Powell, who played a significant role in the administration, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the intelligence at the time of his UN presentation. I consider this a breach of office, even an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has been disrespecting the Constitution and has been trying to diminish its authority, especially since the 9/11 attacks. It appears that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and he also sought to expand the nation's energy supply, which again, is a dubious and underhanded approach.\n\nI think the Iraq war has dragged on long enough. However, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The current plan seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm concerned that this could also cause long-term issues, such as disputes over Iraq's sovereignty. From the news reports, the interim government seems weak, with the Prime Minister having limited control and extremist elements vying for power. I don't think that the political process in Iraq is stable right now.",

            "I don't think it's appropriate for states or the federal government to make it legal or consider it as such. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and any attempts to impose power over this issue would go against what's been established. It seems that those pushing for its illegality are favoring one religion over others, as most Christians and Catholics are opposed to it. I believe the government should not decide what churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, and creating an amendment on this would be contradictory and potentially harmful, as it could restrict people's freedom rather than the government's power. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this matter; I believe the decision should be left to the churches. There's no substantial reason other than personal beliefs for pushing this amendment, and it might even positively impact society more than not.",
            "The Iraq War\nInitially, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for war. They attempted to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though the connection was weak. By exploiting the public's anger and emotions, the government started the war in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the government not learning from past mistakes. Many American soldiers lost their lives, and the absence of a functioning government led to chaos. The U.S. tried to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their failed attempt in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and time required for such a transition.\n\nI believe the U.S. should not have entered the war and, if they did, should have better planned for all possible outcomes. The government did not adequately prepare for the aftermath, and the U.S. is still involved in Iraq today, nearly three years later. The U.S. government also misled the American people into believing the war would be quick and successful.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to finish what he started. However, now I'm torn between staying to support Iraq's transition to democracy and the high cost of American lives. The decision to invade Iraq also raises questions about the U.S. priorities, as other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being targeted. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm pessimistic about that happening.",
            "I have always been supportive of same-sex marriage. I believe it’s a personal preference and not something that should be controlled or restricted. It has been scientifically proven that sexual orientation is biological, not a choice, so it seems unfair to deny rights based on something beyond one's control. I find it inhumane to limit people's rights due to something they can't control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't believe that politics or government should interfere with this issue; it's a personal matter, not a state or federal one. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who live together but aren't married because they're not legally allowed to. They function just like any other family. It seems ridiculous that people like Bush would try to interpret the meaning of marriage in their own way.\n\nI've read and heard from many sources that being gay is likely due to biological factors, not environmental ones. I think it's wrong to make a big deal out of a decision that should be private and personal. It's not like someone can't get married in secret; they can just run off to Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to marry, it gets reported in the news. It should be a personal issue, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Once something is shared online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've already faced this issue. Anything you post online can shape others' opinions of you. If you discuss potentially harmful topics like violence, someone might take you seriously and report it. The school can't ignore this because they have a responsibility to act. However, not everything online should be taken literally, as some people might joke about serious topics. A friend of mine had a situation where someone overheard a comment about a school incident, which led to concerned authorities checking the person's Facebook. If something is brought to a school official's attention, they can't ignore it because they need to ensure safety. It's not their job to monitor every social media account, but if they are informed, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake accounts to monitor students either. It's not ethical or their responsibility.",
            "I feel that the war has persisted far too long. Initially, the goal of restoring democracy in another nation seemed noble. However, I believe we've since lost sight of that objective. It seems we're now waging war more to maintain our image as a superpower than for any genuine political reason. The original motivation may have been influenced by personal grievances from George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, that would be justified. However, if personal matters were a factor, it would not be fair. I think we established our purpose clearly in the initial months of the war, but the conflict has dragged on for too long, consuming immense resources that could be better spent on our own domestic issues. The Iraqi government should now be able to fend for itself, and it's time for us to withdraw. Sustaining this war while our own economy struggles with issues like poverty and infrastructure is unsustainable. The billions spent on this conflict could be better allocated to address our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and public works.",
            "Could I ask a question to clarify how this incident occurred?\n\nI wasn't sure, but it seems someone looked online and found information that prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nYes, that's understandable. If you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone. On platforms like Myspace, you might need to accept someone as a friend to see their profile, but you're essentially giving them permission to view your details. When you share information online, you must accept that many people will see it.\n\nHowever, it's impractical for someone to constantly monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues. It could lead to unfair treatment if only certain groups are targeted. It also depends on why someone accessed a profile—were they looking for evidence of potential harm or were they just casually browsing?\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I feel uneasy knowing that there are people out there who can learn a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen cases where people have used this information to meet someone in person, and that can be quite concerning.\n\nI limit what I share, but I also want to stay connected with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but I'm still concerned about who might be looking at my information.\n\nI've heard that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by their school. I find that a bit strange—was the school really in a position to restrict students' online activities?",

            "I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women, but also extends across different industries and job fields. For instance, women often face barriers like the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite being qualified, they may not be considered for promotions due to historical stereotypes. Similarly, men who take on traditionally female roles, such as stay-at-home fathers, can face disapproval. In the fashion industry, men can be dismissed because their involvement might not align with societal expectations. Depending on the field, gender bias can manifest in various ways. While progress is being made, such as women taking on higher executive roles, change is slow and requires patience. Social acceptance of unconventional roles is gradually increasing, necessitating a balanced approach to promoting these changes. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on one's background or grammatical proficiency, not just gender, indicating the multi-faceted nature of bias in society.",
            "My understanding is that while they didn't make it legal, they did decriminalize it, meaning it was downgraded from a criminal offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and brought in. Even though it might not completely erase the future ramifications, such as for job interviews, the costs associated with arrest, booking, and prosecution are significant. Many financially struggling municipalities might not prioritize decriminalization due to these costs, but places like Denver, with a more liberal mindset, might benefit from it. While marijuana shouldn't be made available everywhere, there's a financial argument for decriminalization to free up resources for other purposes. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about making it as widely available as cigarettes, as it could lead to more public smoking and driving under the influence.

It’s important to maintain these roots while also being adaptable to change. However, the strict adherence to dogma can sometimes come across as intolerant. A lot of Catholics are required to attend Church weekly and are expected to follow strict guidelines. This can make some people feel unwelcome if they don't fully follow the doctrine, including those of different religions or denominations. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic respectively, were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's denomination. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is often hypocritically not applied to those who don't fit the mold. Therefore, while some Catholic doctrine preaches love and acceptance, the actual practice often feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, I don't believe allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent any issues related to pedophilia, as those actions are likely motivated by personal desires rather than marital status.",
            "I\nI haven't fully decided on this issue\nSo\nI can't say which side is correct\nBut\nI think this is one of the most challenging subjects we're dealing with today\nBecause\nIt's so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage, which can be very tricky without upsetting anyone\nSo\nI'm unsure about\nI think\nAll civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be treated\nAnd\nAs\nDefined by the government\nConsidering it's a sacrament, people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment if they were baptized\nSo\nIf someone is married, I think they should be considered a civil union\nBecause\nThat's essentially what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't be subjected to separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't be asked about the type of marriage they had\nIt's just two people who have united together\nSo\nAnd\nRegarding gay marriage\nI mean\nIt would just be\nTwo people in a civil union\n\nIf all states could reach a logical agreement, they should push to make it a federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd\nIt's\nThe constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it's a significant cause for some people\nBut\nIt's not substantial enough to warrant a constitutional amendment\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define or ban\nGay marriage\nIn short",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, which makes me feel uncertain about homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I don't necessarily endorse their lifestyle, I believe that it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each individual state. Many states lean democratic, and I don't see a reason to disagree with their decisions if they choose to legalize gay marriage, as they reflect the values of the people living there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think each state should decide on its own. I don't agree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't be able to dictate how each state runs. I think this issue should be left to the individual states, not the president, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "To begin with, MySpace is publicly accessible, so when you post on it, you should expect that others, including school authorities, may see it. Thus, I believe it's reasonable for school officials to see your posts if it helps them prevent a school shooting or improve school safety. However, if they are solely monitoring student activities to catch them in trouble, that would be an invasion of privacy. But if their actions lead to a safer school, I don't see it as invasive. Ultimately, everything you post online can be monitored and used against you, so it's essential to be cautious about what you share. School officials should only be monitoring for genuine safety concerns.",
            "Initially, I fully supported the war due to my personal connection to the events of September 11. I was eager to retaliate against those who carried out the attacks, and I believed that a military response would create the same level of chaos they caused here. However, I now realize that our response was driven more by emotion and anger than strategic planning. We entered the conflict unprepared and with a vague understanding of what we were facing. Our approach was reactionary and not based on a clear plan for long-term success. I believe that the war has largely been a wasted effort, as the internal divisions among the locals have hindered our ability to instill lasting change. The people there are more concerned with their own conflicts than engaging with us, and I'm uncertain if our military presence is making a positive difference. I regret that our initial enthusiasm was not tempered by a well-thought-out strategy. Ultimately, I think it's time to leave and allow the situation to stabilize on its own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While it has strong views on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is understandable, these views can seem outdated to some. I think adapting to more modern perspectives might help prevent the loss of followers. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which can make them uncomfortable. For instance, those who support abortion or same-sex marriage might not be comfortable in a faith that considers these practices wrong. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past scandals. The Church argues that priests are married to God, but this doesn't preclude them from having family lives like other professionals.",
            "I personally am not against gay marriage. I believe that being gay is not a choice that someone makes consciously. People shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from getting married. I don't think it's a choice that someone makes and it's not something that the federal government should be involved in, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's simply who they are, and they shouldn't be punished or discriminated against for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a compelling reason to keep it illegal. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is an oversimplification as there are many distinct aspects to these relationships. They can be compared to two sides of the same coin; while they differ in aspects, the essence is the same. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage would entail similar civil rights, such as property rights and healthcare provisions for partners, which are currently limited.\n\nScientific studies show that homosexual couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates and child-rearing skills as heterosexual couples. The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding of what gay marriage actually is; it is a legal document from the government, not a religious ceremony. Allowing civil unions while denying marriage is akin to segregation. Furthermore, concerns about adoption and community issues are unfounded, as the issues are more about societal perceptions and treatment of children than about their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states, amending the constitution to reflect this. However, I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the matter, as his views are influenced by his religious beliefs. Most reasons for opposition are moral, but morality varies greatly among individuals and shouldn't be imposed on the entire population. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring other cultural and moral concepts.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about the psychological makeup of homosexuals, but these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Let me clarify something: The fact that a drug is illegal doesn't inherently make it beneficial. While I don't advocate for making such drugs available to the general public, I believe they can be used medicinally. I've seen this with controlled substances like oxycotton, Vicodin, and Percocets. The point is, it's not about the drug's legality, but about its benefits. Regarding marijuana, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol because it's not as harmful as harder drugs. I wouldn't rush to legalize it all at once, but rather gradually, and only after removing the negative stigma surrounding it. People would be more likely to use it responsibly once they see it differently.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less stringent than it once was. When I was young, I used to go to church every Sunday, always dressed in matching outfits with my friends from my private school. Now, the church offers teenage masses that are shorter and more casual, with people dressing more relaxed, even in summer. I've noticed that the church has become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis to morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe pedophilia is a genetic condition that cannot be cured by marital status. I think if a priest wants to marry but also practice their faith, they should consider another religion.",
            "Initially, the idea of the Iraq war was acceptable, but considering the heightened emotions and concerns following the September 11th attacks, I believe the U.S. went to war, in part, based on false pretexts that the administration used to justify their actions. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein's regime with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. This has always troubled me, as it seems like the administration deliberately misled the American public.\n\nColin Powell, who played a significant role in the administration, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the intelligence at the time of his UN presentation. I consider this a breach of office, even an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has been disrespecting the Constitution and has been trying to diminish its authority, especially since the 9/11 attacks. It appears that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and he also sought to expand the nation's energy supply, which again, is a dubious and underhanded approach.\n\nI think the Iraq war has dragged on long enough. However, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The current plan seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm concerned that this could also cause long-term issues, such as disputes over Iraq's sovereignty. From the news reports, the interim government seems weak, with the Prime Minister having limited control and extremist elements vying for power. I don't think that the political process in Iraq is stable right now.",

            "I don't think it's appropriate for states or the federal government to make it legal or consider it as such. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and any attempts to impose power over this issue would go against what's been established. It seems that those pushing for its illegality are favoring one religion over others, as most Christians and Catholics are opposed to it. I believe the government should not decide what churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, and creating an amendment on this would be contradictory and potentially harmful, as it could restrict people's freedom rather than the government's power. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this matter; I believe the decision should be left to the churches. There's no substantial reason other than personal beliefs for pushing this amendment, and it might even positively impact society more than not.",
            "The Iraq War\nInitially, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for war. They attempted to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though the connection was weak. By exploiting the public's anger and emotions, the government started the war in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the government not learning from past mistakes. Many American soldiers lost their lives, and the absence of a functioning government led to chaos. The U.S. tried to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their failed attempt in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and time required for such a transition.\n\nI believe the U.S. should not have entered the war and, if they did, should have better planned for all possible outcomes. The government did not adequately prepare for the aftermath, and the U.S. is still involved in Iraq today, nearly three years later. The U.S. government also misled the American people into believing the war would be quick and successful.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to finish what he started. However, now I'm torn between staying to support Iraq's transition to democracy and the high cost of American lives. The decision to invade Iraq also raises questions about the U.S. priorities, as other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being targeted. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm pessimistic about that happening.",
            "I have always been supportive of same-sex marriage. I believe it’s a personal preference and not something that should be controlled or restricted. It has been scientifically proven that sexual orientation is biological, not a choice, so it seems unfair to deny rights based on something beyond one's control. I find it inhumane to limit people's rights due to something they can't control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't believe that politics or government should interfere with this issue; it's a personal matter, not a state or federal one. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who live together but aren't married because they're not legally allowed to. They function just like any other family. It seems ridiculous that people like Bush would try to interpret the meaning of marriage in their own way.\n\nI've read and heard from many sources that being gay is likely due to biological factors, not environmental ones. I think it's wrong to make a big deal out of a decision that should be private and personal. It's not like someone can't get married in secret; they can just run off to Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to marry, it gets reported in the news. It should be a personal issue, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Once something is shared online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've already faced this issue. Anything you post online can shape others' opinions of you. If you discuss potentially harmful topics like violence, someone might take you seriously and report it. The school can't ignore this because they have a responsibility to act. However, not everything online should be taken literally, as some people might joke about serious topics. A friend of mine had a situation where someone overheard a comment about a school incident, which led to concerned authorities checking the person's Facebook. If something is brought to a school official's attention, they can't ignore it because they need to ensure safety. It's not their job to monitor every social media account, but if they are informed, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake accounts to monitor students either. It's not ethical or their responsibility.",
            "I feel that the war has persisted far too long. Initially, the goal of restoring democracy in another nation seemed noble. However, I believe we've since lost sight of that objective. It seems we're now waging war more to maintain our image as a superpower than for any genuine political reason. The original motivation may have been influenced by personal grievances from George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, that would be justified. However, if personal matters were a factor, it would not be fair. I think we established our purpose clearly in the initial months of the war, but the conflict has dragged on for too long, consuming immense resources that could be better spent on our own domestic issues. The Iraqi government should now be able to fend for itself, and it's time for us to withdraw. Sustaining this war while our own economy struggles with issues like poverty and infrastructure is unsustainable. The billions spent on this conflict could be better allocated to address our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and public works.",
            "Could I ask a question to clarify how this incident occurred?\n\nI wasn't sure, but it seems someone looked online and found information that prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nYes, that's understandable. If you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone. On platforms like Myspace, you might need to accept someone as a friend to see their profile, but you're essentially giving them permission to view your details. When you share information online, you must accept that many people will see it.\n\nHowever, it's impractical for someone to constantly monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues. It could lead to unfair treatment if only certain groups are targeted. It also depends on why someone accessed a profile—were they looking for evidence of potential harm or were they just casually browsing?\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I feel uneasy knowing that there are people out there who can learn a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen cases where people have used this information to meet someone in person, and that can be quite concerning.\n\nI limit what I share, but I also want to stay connected with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but I'm still concerned about who might be looking at my information.\n\nI've heard that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by their school. I find that a bit strange—was the school really in a position to restrict students' online activities?",

            "I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women, but also extends across different industries and job fields. For instance, women often face barriers like the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite being qualified, they may not be considered for promotions due to historical stereotypes. Similarly, men who take on traditionally female roles, such as stay-at-home fathers, can face disapproval. In the fashion industry, men can be dismissed because their involvement might not align with societal expectations. Depending on the field, gender bias can manifest in various ways. While progress is being made, such as women taking on higher executive roles, change is slow and requires patience. Social acceptance of unconventional roles is gradually increasing, necessitating a balanced approach to promoting these changes. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on one's background or grammatical proficiency, not just gender, indicating the multi-faceted nature of bias in society.",
            "My understanding is that while they didn't make it legal, they did decriminalize it, meaning it was downgraded from a criminal offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and brought in. Even though it might not completely erase the future ramifications, such as for job interviews, the costs associated with arrest, booking, and prosecution are significant. Many financially struggling municipalities might not prioritize decriminalization due to these costs, but places like Denver, with a more liberal mindset, might benefit from it. While marijuana shouldn't be made available everywhere, there's a financial argument for decriminalization to free up resources for other purposes. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about making it as widely available as cigarettes, as it could lead to more public smoking and driving under the influence.

It’s important to maintain these roots while also being adaptable to change. However, the strict adherence to dogma can sometimes come across as intolerant. A lot of Catholics are required to attend Church weekly and are expected to follow strict guidelines. This can make some people feel unwelcome if they don't fully follow the doctrine, including those of different religions or denominations. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic respectively, were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's denomination. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is often hypocritically not applied to those who don't fit the mold. Therefore, while some Catholic doctrine preaches love and acceptance, the actual practice often feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, I don't believe allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent any issues related to pedophilia, as those actions are likely motivated by personal desires rather than marital status.",
            "I\nI haven't fully decided on this issue\nSo\nI can't say which side is correct\nBut\nI think this is one of the most challenging subjects we're dealing with today\nBecause\nIt's so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage, which can be very tricky without upsetting anyone\nSo\nI'm unsure about\nI think\nAll civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be treated\nAnd\nAs\nDefined by the government\nConsidering it's a sacrament, people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment if they were baptized\nSo\nIf someone is married, I think they should be considered a civil union\nBecause\nThat's essentially what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't be subjected to separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't be asked about the type of marriage they had\nIt's just two people who have united together\nSo\nAnd\nRegarding gay marriage\nI mean\nIt would just be\nTwo people in a civil union\n\nIf all states could reach a logical agreement, they should push to make it a federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd\nIt's\nThe constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it's a significant cause for some people\nBut\nIt's not substantial enough to warrant a constitutional amendment\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define or ban\nGay marriage\nIn short",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, which makes me feel uncertain about homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I don't necessarily endorse their lifestyle, I believe that it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each individual state. Many states lean democratic, and I don't see a reason to disagree with their decisions if they choose to legalize gay marriage, as they reflect the values of the people living there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think each state should decide on its own. I don't agree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't be able to dictate how each state runs. I think this issue should be left to the individual states, not the president, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "To begin with, MySpace is publicly accessible, so when you post on it, you should expect that others, including school authorities, may see it. Thus, I believe it's reasonable for school officials to see your posts if it helps them prevent a school shooting or improve school safety. However, if they are solely monitoring student activities to catch them in trouble, that would be an invasion of privacy. But if their actions lead to a safer school, I don't see it as invasive. Ultimately, everything you post online can be monitored and used against you, so it's essential to be cautious about what you share. School officials should only be monitoring for genuine safety concerns.",
            "Initially, I fully supported the war due to my personal connection to the events of September 11. I was eager to retaliate against those who carried out the attacks, and I believed that a military response would create the same level of chaos they caused here. However, I now realize that our response was driven more by emotion and anger than strategic planning. We entered the conflict unprepared and with a vague understanding of what we were facing. Our approach was reactionary and not based on a clear plan for long-term success. I believe that the war has largely been a wasted effort, as the internal divisions among the locals have hindered our ability to instill lasting change. The people there are more concerned with their own conflicts than engaging with us, and I'm uncertain if our military presence is making a positive difference. I regret that our initial enthusiasm was not tempered by a well-thought-out strategy. Ultimately, I think it's time to leave and allow the situation to stabilize on its own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While it has strong views on issues like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, which is understandable, these views can seem outdated to some. I think adapting to more modern perspectives might help prevent the loss of followers. People are increasingly disagreeing with the Church's stance on these issues, which can make them uncomfortable. For instance, those who support abortion or same-sex marriage might not be comfortable in a faith that considers these practices wrong. I don't see why the Church can't allow female priests or married priests, but I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented past scandals. The Church argues that priests are married to God, but this doesn't preclude them from having family lives like other professionals.",
            "I personally am not against gay marriage. I believe that being gay is not a choice that someone makes consciously. People shouldn't be held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems wrong to say that a man and a woman can marry, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't given this topic much thought, but I do believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from getting married. I don't think it's a choice that someone makes and it's not something that the federal government should be involved in, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's simply who they are, and they shouldn't be punished or discriminated against for that.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there isn't a compelling reason to keep it illegal. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this is an oversimplification as there are many distinct aspects to these relationships. They can be compared to two sides of the same coin; while they differ in aspects, the essence is the same. Additionally, legalizing gay marriage would entail similar civil rights, such as property rights and healthcare provisions for partners, which are currently limited.\n\nScientific studies show that homosexual couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates and child-rearing skills as heterosexual couples. The primary issue seems to be a misunderstanding of what gay marriage actually is; it is a legal document from the government, not a religious ceremony. Allowing civil unions while denying marriage is akin to segregation. Furthermore, concerns about adoption and community issues are unfounded, as the issues are more about societal perceptions and treatment of children than about their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nI believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states, amending the constitution to reflect this. However, I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the matter, as his views are influenced by his religious beliefs. Most reasons for opposition are moral, but morality varies greatly among individuals and shouldn't be imposed on the entire population. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards while ignoring other cultural and moral concepts.\n\nMany people oppose gay marriage due to misconceptions about the psychological makeup of homosexuals, but these views are not supported by scientific research. Institutions that conduct studies on these subjects should be trusted over popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. Let me clarify something: The fact that a drug is illegal doesn't inherently make it beneficial. While I don't advocate for making such drugs available to the general public, I believe they can be used medicinally. I've seen this with controlled substances like oxycotton, Vicodin, and Percocets. The point is, it's not about the drug's legality, but about its benefits. Regarding marijuana, I don't think it's comparable to alcohol because it's not as harmful as harder drugs. I wouldn't rush to legalize it all at once, but rather gradually, and only after removing the negative stigma surrounding it. People would be more likely to use it responsibly once they see it differently.",
            "I believe the church has already adapted to the 21st century, becoming less stringent than it once was. When I was young, I used to go to church every Sunday, always dressed in matching outfits with my friends from my private school. Now, the church offers teenage masses that are shorter and more casual, with people dressing more relaxed, even in summer. I've noticed that the church has become more casual, with people wearing jeans and khakis to morning masses. Regarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think these issues could have been prevented by allowing female priests or priests to marry. I believe pedophilia is a genetic condition that cannot be cured by marital status. I think if a priest wants to marry but also practice their faith, they should consider another religion.",
            "Initially, the idea of the Iraq war was acceptable, but considering the heightened emotions and concerns following the September 11th attacks, I believe the U.S. went to war, in part, based on false pretexts that the administration used to justify their actions. The Bush administration linked Saddam Hussein's regime with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction, which later proved to be false. This has always troubled me, as it seems like the administration deliberately misled the American public.\n\nColin Powell, who played a significant role in the administration, has since admitted that he wasn't convinced by the intelligence at the time of his UN presentation. I consider this a breach of office, even an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration has been disrespecting the Constitution and has been trying to diminish its authority, especially since the 9/11 attacks. It appears that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein due to his father's administration, and he also sought to expand the nation's energy supply, which again, is a dubious and underhanded approach.\n\nI think the Iraq war has dragged on long enough. However, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war, causing more deaths. The current plan seems to be a coalition of neighboring countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to help restore order, but I'm concerned that this could also cause long-term issues, such as disputes over Iraq's sovereignty. From the news reports, the interim government seems weak, with the Prime Minister having limited control and extremist elements vying for power. I don't think that the political process in Iraq is stable right now.",

            "I don't think it's appropriate for states or the federal government to make it legal or consider it as such. The Constitution clearly states the separation of church and state, and any attempts to impose power over this issue would go against what's been established. It seems that those pushing for its illegality are favoring one religion over others, as most Christians and Catholics are opposed to it. I believe the government should not decide what churches can and can't make illegal. The separation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, and creating an amendment on this would be contradictory and potentially harmful, as it could restrict people's freedom rather than the government's power. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this matter; I believe the decision should be left to the churches. There's no substantial reason other than personal beliefs for pushing this amendment, and it might even positively impact society more than not.",
            "The Iraq War\nInitially, I don't believe the government was fully honest with the American people about the reasons for war. They attempted to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, even though the connection was weak. By exploiting the public's anger and emotions, the government started the war in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes. I think the war in Iraq is reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the government not learning from past mistakes. Many American soldiers lost their lives, and the absence of a functioning government led to chaos. The U.S. tried to establish a democratic government in Iraq, similar to their failed attempt in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and time required for such a transition.\n\nI believe the U.S. should not have entered the war and, if they did, should have better planned for all possible outcomes. The government did not adequately prepare for the aftermath, and the U.S. is still involved in Iraq today, nearly three years later. The U.S. government also misled the American people into believing the war would be quick and successful.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to finish what he started. However, now I'm torn between staying to support Iraq's transition to democracy and the high cost of American lives. The decision to invade Iraq also raises questions about the U.S. priorities, as other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being targeted. I hope the war ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm pessimistic about that happening.",
            "I have always been supportive of same-sex marriage. I believe it’s a personal preference and not something that should be controlled or restricted. It has been scientifically proven that sexual orientation is biological, not a choice, so it seems unfair to deny rights based on something beyond one's control. I find it inhumane to limit people's rights due to something they can't control. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't believe that politics or government should interfere with this issue; it's a personal matter, not a state or federal one. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who live together but aren't married because they're not legally allowed to. They function just like any other family. It seems ridiculous that people like Bush would try to interpret the meaning of marriage in their own way.\n\nI've read and heard from many sources that being gay is likely due to biological factors, not environmental ones. I think it's wrong to make a big deal out of a decision that should be private and personal. It's not like someone can't get married in secret; they can just run off to Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to marry, it gets reported in the news. It should be a personal issue, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "Once something is shared online, it's out in the open for everyone to see. As a Resident Assistant, I've already faced this issue. Anything you post online can shape others' opinions of you. If you discuss potentially harmful topics like violence, someone might take you seriously and report it. The school can't ignore this because they have a responsibility to act. However, not everything online should be taken literally, as some people might joke about serious topics. A friend of mine had a situation where someone overheard a comment about a school incident, which led to concerned authorities checking the person's Facebook. If something is brought to a school official's attention, they can't ignore it because they need to ensure safety. It's not their job to monitor every social media account, but if they are informed, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake accounts to monitor students either. It's not ethical or their responsibility.",
            "I feel that the war has persisted far too long. Initially, the goal of restoring democracy in another nation seemed noble. However, I believe we've since lost sight of that objective. It seems we're now waging war more to maintain our image as a superpower than for any genuine political reason. The original motivation may have been influenced by personal grievances from George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the purpose was to bring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system, that would be justified. However, if personal matters were a factor, it would not be fair. I think we established our purpose clearly in the initial months of the war, but the conflict has dragged on for too long, consuming immense resources that could be better spent on our own domestic issues. The Iraqi government should now be able to fend for itself, and it's time for us to withdraw. Sustaining this war while our own economy struggles with issues like poverty and infrastructure is unsustainable. The billions spent on this conflict could be better allocated to address our own pressing needs, such as healthcare and public works.",
            "Could I ask a question to clarify how this incident occurred?\n\nI wasn't sure, but it seems someone looked online and found information that prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nYes, that's understandable. If you post information on the internet, it's generally accessible to anyone. On platforms like Myspace, you might need to accept someone as a friend to see their profile, but you're essentially giving them permission to view your details. When you share information online, you must accept that many people will see it.\n\nHowever, it's impractical for someone to constantly monitor everyone's profiles to prevent issues. It could lead to unfair treatment if only certain groups are targeted. It also depends on why someone accessed a profile—were they looking for evidence of potential harm or were they just casually browsing?\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I feel uneasy knowing that there are people out there who can learn a lot about me just by looking at my profile. I've seen cases where people have used this information to meet someone in person, and that can be quite concerning.\n\nI limit what I share, but I also want to stay connected with friends. It's a delicate balance. I only accept people I know, but I'm still concerned about who might be looking at my information.\n\nI've heard that in high school, students were banned from using Myspace by their school. I find that a bit strange—was the school really in a position to restrict students' online activities?",

            "I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a significant issue in the United States. It's not limited to women, but also extends across different industries and job fields. For instance, women often face barriers like the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite being qualified, they may not be considered for promotions due to historical stereotypes. Similarly, men who take on traditionally female roles, such as stay-at-home fathers, can face disapproval. In the fashion industry, men can be dismissed because their involvement might not align with societal expectations. Depending on the field, gender bias can manifest in various ways. While progress is being made, such as women taking on higher executive roles, change is slow and requires patience. Social acceptance of unconventional roles is gradually increasing, necessitating a balanced approach to promoting these changes. Additionally, discrimination can occur based on one's background or grammatical proficiency, not just gender, indicating the multi-faceted nature of bias in society.",
            "My understanding is that while they didn't make it legal, they did decriminalize it, meaning it was downgraded from a criminal offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, where you get cited instead of arrested and brought in. Even though it might not completely erase the future ramifications, such as for job interviews, the costs associated with arrest, booking, and prosecution are significant. Many financially struggling municipalities might not prioritize decriminalization due to these costs, but places like Denver, with a more liberal mindset, might benefit from it. While marijuana shouldn't be made available everywhere, there's a financial argument for decriminalization to free up resources for other purposes. Additionally, I'm not sure how I feel about making it as widely available as cigarettes, as it could lead to more public smoking and driving under the influence.

It’s important to maintain these roots while also being adaptable to change. However, the strict adherence to dogma can sometimes come across as intolerant. A lot of Catholics are required to attend Church weekly and are expected to follow strict guidelines. This can make some people feel unwelcome if they don't fully follow the doctrine, including those of different religions or denominations. For instance, my parents, who were an Episcopalian and a Catholic respectively, were not allowed to marry in the Catholic Church because of my father's denomination. This seems contradictory to the Catholic teaching of loving others, which is often hypocritically not applied to those who don't fit the mold. Therefore, while some Catholic doctrine preaches love and acceptance, the actual practice often feels outdated and exclusionary. Additionally, I don't believe allowing priests to marry would necessarily prevent any issues related to pedophilia, as those actions are likely motivated by personal desires rather than marital status.",
            "I\nI haven't fully decided on this issue\nSo\nI can't say which side is correct\nBut\nI think this is one of the most challenging subjects we're dealing with today\nBecause\nIt's so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage, which can be very tricky without upsetting anyone\nSo\nI'm unsure about\nI think\nAll civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be treated\nAnd\nAs\nDefined by the government\nConsidering it's a sacrament, people wouldn't get tax breaks or special treatment if they were baptized\nSo\nIf someone is married, I think they should be considered a civil union\nBecause\nThat's essentially what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't be subjected to separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't be asked about the type of marriage they had\nIt's just two people who have united together\nSo\nAnd\nRegarding gay marriage\nI mean\nIt would just be\nTwo people in a civil union\n\nIf all states could reach a logical agreement, they should push to make it a federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is absurd\nIt's\nThe constitution shouldn't be amended for something\nI mean it's a significant cause for some people\nBut\nIt's not substantial enough to warrant a constitutional amendment\n\nIt's just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define or ban\nGay marriage\nIn short",
            "I grew up in a Christian household, which makes me feel uncertain about homosexuality, as I have many gay friends. While I don't necessarily endorse their lifestyle, I believe that it should be legal. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather a decision left to each individual state. Many states lean democratic, and I don't see a reason to disagree with their decisions if they choose to legalize gay marriage, as they reflect the values of the people living there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I think each state should decide on its own. I don't agree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as he doesn't live in every state and shouldn't be able to dictate how each state runs. I think this issue should be left to the individual states, not the president, as they will be the ones to live with the consequences of their decisions.",
            "To begin with, MySpace is publicly accessible, so when you post on it, you should expect that others, including school authorities, may see it. Thus, I believe it's reasonable for school officials to see your posts if it helps them prevent a school shooting or improve school safety. However, if they are solely monitoring student activities to catch them in trouble, that would be an invasion of privacy. But if their actions lead to a safer school, I don't see it as invasive. Ultimately, everything you post online can be monitored and used against you, so it's essential to be cautious about what you share. School officials should only be monitoring for genuine safety concerns.",
            "Initially, I fully supported the war due to my personal connection to the events of September 11. I was eager to retaliate against those who carried out the attacks, and I believed that a military response would create the same level of chaos they caused here. However, I now realize that our response was driven more by emotion and anger than strategic planning. We entered the conflict unprepared and with a vague understanding of what we were facing. Our approach was reactionary and not based on a clear plan for long-term success. I believe that the war has largely been a wasted effort, as the internal divisions among the locals have hindered our ability to instill lasting change. The people there are more concerned with their own conflicts than engaging with us, and I'm uncertain if our military presence is making a positive difference. I regret that our initial enthusiasm was not tempered by a well-thought-out strategy. Ultimately, I think it's time to leave and allow the situation to stabilize on its own."
