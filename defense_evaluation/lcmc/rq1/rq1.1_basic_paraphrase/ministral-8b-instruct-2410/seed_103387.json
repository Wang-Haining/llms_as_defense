            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. I've heard discussions about their dwindling membership, and I think it's due to their unaccepting stance on many issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their views are strong but somewhat outdated. If they embraced a more modern perspective, they might not face the same loss of followers. People are starting to disagree with the Church's positions on these subjects, causing some to turn away. For instance, if one is pro-choice or supports same-sex marriage, they may not feel comfortable following a church that opposes these views. I don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests, but I'm unsure if these changes would prevent the issues they currently face. The Church's loyalty to God, as they claim, should not preclude them from also having a family life. Everyone else manages to balance work and family life, so I see no reason why priests can't do the same.",
            "I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that sexual orientation isn't something people choose; it's just who they are. People shouldn't be judged or held accountable for it. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't. I think it's wrong for the government to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, I don't think the government should interfere because it's not a matter of national security or moral right. It's not the government's place to dictate who can and can't marry. It's not something that gay people should be penalized for, as it's a part of their nature.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized due to the lack of substantial arguments against it. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but they are different in numerous ways that prevent them from being considered the same. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Numerous civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should be extended to same-sex couples. For instance, a same-sex partner cannot visit or support a sick spouse in the hospital if not deemed \"family.\" I think it's absurd to deny this right to couples who will spend their lives together. Scientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is that people often conflate religious marriage with civil marriage. Same-sex couples are not requesting church ceremonies but rather legal recognition. If civil unions are acceptable, why not marriage? Segregation in the past was \"separate but unequal.\" Same-sex couples form relationships and have the same challenges and triumphs as heterosexual couples. Adoption and community concerns are valid, but evidence shows children are resilient and adaptable. School bullying is more of an issue than the children's upbringing. The federal government should make same-sex marriage legal nationwide. President Bush, influenced by his religious beliefs, opposes it, but moral viewpoints differ among individuals and groups. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country. People often hold negative views of homosexuality due to misconceptions about its origin, but psychological research contradicts these beliefs. People should rely on credible institutions rather than popular opinion to shape their views.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Let me clarify that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. While I believe it should not be available to the general public, it can be used for medicinal purposes. I understand that some illegal drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are beneficial and widely used in pharmacies. Similarly, I think marijuana can be beneficial and used for medical purposes, even though it is illegal. It's important to distinguish that marijuana's illegal status is not a reflection of its intrinsic value or potential benefits. Moreover, I don't believe marijuana is as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. I think it's crucial to remove the negative stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then gradually integrate it into legal frameworks. People should be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than in the past. As a child, I recall dressing up in cute outfits every Sunday when I attended church regularly. Now, I notice a more casual atmosphere, with services lasting only 30 minutes and people wearing beach clothes or jeans and khakis. The church I know has also grown more casual, even during morning masses. However, I don't know the politics of the church, so I can't comment on that.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been avoided by allowing female priests or priests to marry. Pedophilia is often a result of genetics, not marital status. Some men married with children may still be attracted to young kids, and I think the church couldn't have prevented these incidents. If they knew about them and covered them up, that would be wrong, but I don't believe they always did.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but the September 11th attacks had everyone shaken, and I believe we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, with the Bush administration falsely linking the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. This has always bothered me, and it still does. The administration lied to the American people, according to even Colin Powell, who later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented. I believe this is a serious issue and could potentially be an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration disregarded the constitution from the start, with a vengeance-driven agenda against Saddam Hussein, and possibly also aiming to secure more energy resources. Withdrawing now might lead to civil war, but the UN and US's plan to involve neighboring countries doesn't seem reliable in the long run due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the weak, divided interim government. The political process is chaotic, with radical elements vying for control.",

            "I truly don't think it's appropriate for a state to legalize or declare as legal something that the churches themselves should decide on. The Constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and any attempt to enforce rules over this would be a defiance of the constitutional principles. I believe that it's up to the churches to decide on such matters, and not the government. It's important to note that the vast majority of Catholics and Christians in the United States are against it, except in a few specific areas like Boston. The push for an amendment to make this illegal seems to be motivated by personal religious beliefs, which is not a valid reason for government intervention. I don't see how this would positively impact the economy or society. Therefore, I don't feel it's right for the government to be involved in this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nWell, to begin with, I believe the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, which in reality had little to do with Iraq. They exploited the public's anger and outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally oppose wars, especially preventive ones, and I think the government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the Vietnam War. The war in Iraq, like Vietnam, resulted in a significant loss of American lives and the removal of the Iraqi government. The government seemed unprepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a long, challenging process.\n\nThe government should have planned better for all possible outcomes and prepared for the long-term commitment required to stabilize a post-war country. The U.S. has been in Iraq for several years, and the conflict remains unresolved. I believe the government's initial portrayal of the war was misleading, making it seem like a short, successful campaign. The reality, however, is that establishing democracy is a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have supported George Bush if I could vote, mainly because I wanted him to finish what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult due to the high number of American casualties and the question of how much risk it's worth to establish a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, it's unclear why Iraq was the focus when other countries with similar issues have not been targeted.\n\nThe primary reason for invading Iraq was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. Other nations with confirmed weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, have not been targeted. This raises concerns about the honesty and thoroughness of the government's decision-making process.\n\nI hope the conflict ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm not optimistic about it happening anytime soon.",
            "I'm in favor of gay marriage. I've always held this view. I truly believe it's a personal choice, and research is increasingly suggesting it's more biological than sociological. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to deny people rights over something beyond their control, which seems inhuman to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and the government shouldn't interfere in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who function just like any other family, despite not being married due to the law. I think it's absurd for Bush to try to interpret the definition of marriage according to his beliefs. I've heard and read from many sources that being gay might be predisposed due to brain chemistry, not societal influences. It's just as personal and private as a heterosexual marriage. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to marry, it becomes a public affair. I believe it should be a personal, private matter, not a public or national issue.",
            "When you post something online, you're putting it out in a public forum. Everyone can see it, including people who might not have anything to do with you. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this personally. Once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing dangerous topics like bomb threats or shootings. If you're friends with someone on a social media platform like Myspace, they'll see your posts, and the school might too. If authorities hear about something potentially harmful, they can't ignore it, even if it might just be a joke gone wrong. Once something is online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. People can't control what others think or do with the information they find. While school officials shouldn't be friends with students online, if something dangerous comes to their attention, it's their job to take it seriously. Monitoring private conversations isn't appropriate, but if information is brought to their attention, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake profiles to monitor students, and I, as an R.A., wouldn't friend residents to keep track of their online activities. It's not my responsibility or desired to know what they're doing on social media.",
            "The war seems to have dragged on excessively. Initially, the aim was commendable, with the goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have strayed from this original purpose and are now involved in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. The motives behind the war may have been dubious, possibly influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. At the outset, the war served as a declaration of intent, but the prolonged conflict has blurred that purpose. The war has become an end in itself, and it's unclear if our initial goals were ever achieved. It's been going on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take control of its own affairs. We've been spending billions on this war at the expense of addressing our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own country and not on prolonged wars. It's time to end this conflict and redirect our resources towards our own pressing needs.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that something was prevented because someone found information online about it. Isn't that an invasion of privacy? When you post information on the internet, it's generally available for everyone to see, especially on platforms like Myspace. While you may need to be friends with someone to view their profile, if you give them permission to see it, it means you've accepted that trade-off. Therefore, when you put information online, you should understand that many people will see it. In this case, I believe it was good that someone found the information and prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nHowever, constantly monitoring everyone's profiles is not practical or fair, as it could lead to discrimination. It's important to consider the context in which the profile was found, whether someone was actively looking for evidence or just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that I know there are creepy people who can access my information. I've seen a TV show where a man easily found a girl's screen name and met her in less than a minute. This raises concerns about privacy and the ease with which people can gather personal information. I try to limit what I post, but I also want to maintain my online presence to communicate with friends. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've also heard that in high school, some students were banned from using Myspace by their school, which I found odd. I'm not sure how school officials have the right to restrict students' online activities. It seems like a privacy issue, but I'm not sure about the specifics.",
            "I have a few things to say about the Iraq War, but I feel uncomfortable doing so. I don't want to join those who claim they were against it from the start, as it's not really relevant now. The general consensus, except within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea. Polls show that 75-80% of people worldwide, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. The situation has been a disaster from the beginning and will continue to be so if we stay. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is too great for us to impose our views on them. Saddam was bad, but the potential consequences of invading had to be weighed against the benefits. I don't see any reason for us to stay. The administration may have reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any compelling ones. I'm open to a gradual withdrawal, but I think we should leave now. Eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year. We should respect their wishes. Leaving now would make us the good guys, even if we can't be the heroes we'd like to be.",
            "Yes, I do indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not just about women; it also extends to certain professions and societal expectations. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" where, despite being qualified, they may not be promoted to higher positions due to historical biases that favor men in leadership roles. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home with their children face societal disapproval and are often seen as less capable because of archaic gender roles. In the fashion industry, men are sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously if they're straight, as they're perceived as not understanding fashion from a woman's perspective. Discrimination isn't limited to gender; it also arises from one's background and education level. Ensuring equality is a gradual process, but progress is being made as more women are entering higher positions and societal attitudes are slowly changing. However, rushing these changes would only meet with resistance, so a balanced approach is key.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t make it legal. They decriminalized it, reducing the offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge with potential jail time. If someone gets caught, the penalty is like a citation, not a full arrest. While this change might be beneficial for job applications and other areas where criminal charges can be detrimental, the societal perception of marijuana use and its potential consequences on behavior and lifestyle remain significant concerns. Decriminalization can also save money for local governments by reducing the need for arrests, trials, and incarceration. However, not all communities are willing to make this change, especially those with strong anti-marijuana sentiments. In more liberal places like Denver, decriminalization has been well-received, allowing the city to allocate more funds to education and social programs. While marijuana should not be made readily available like cigarettes, it’s important to consider the potential financial benefits of decriminalization. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects, their impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people may use substances responsibly, while others may not. Therefore, it's difficult to generalize the effects of substances.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nMany of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing these things for a long time\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to have a strong connection to tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible and adapt to change\nUm\nMany Catholics believe they must attend church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey adhere strictly to how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church can be harsh towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't accept people who aren't completely Catholic\nAnd\nThey also don't accept people of other religions\nUm\nFor example\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nMy mother was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my father's religion\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat's not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat's a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it's so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say if one side is correct or incorrect. However, I do think this is the most challenging topic we're currently dealing with. It's difficult to address the separation of church and state and how to define marriage without upsetting someone. I'm not sure whether all civil unions should be seen as marriage, or how the government should classify them. After all, people wouldn't get special treatment or recognition for being married if they were just baptized. Therefore, I believe that couples who are married should be seen as in a civil union. That's what it is - two people united together. So, if all states can agree on a logical approach, they should work towards making it a federal law. However, I think it's ridiculous to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. It's not a pressing enough issue to warrant such a significant change.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so I must admit that the topic of homosexuality is a bit ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, and I feel that the decision should be left to each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nA lot of states are predominantly Democratic, and in these states, there's likely to be support for gay marriage. If you're living in a state that supports it, it's not fair to disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect that.\n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be decided on a state-by-state basis. I don't believe that the current president should be able to impose his views on all the states. Each state should make its own decision, as they will be the ones affected by it.\n\nI don't think it's fair for the president to decide how every state should run, especially since he won't be in office for much longer. If a new president from a different party changes their mind on the issue, it could just go back and forth. Therefore, it's best to leave the decision up to each individual state.",
            "Let's discuss the matter at hand. I don't entirely agree with the notion that Myspace is private. By definition, a bulletin board is meant for public viewing. If a student posts anything on the internet, they should be aware that it's visible to others, including school officials. They have every right to see it, even if it's not posted under the school's name, as they can access it from their personal devices. However, if the purpose is to prevent a school shooting, then I believe it's justified. School officials should only monitor students if they have reason to believe it's for the safety of the students and the school. Constantly monitoring students without cause is an invasion of privacy. I wouldn't expect students to post something with the intent of getting caught, and the same goes for school officials. If they're monitoring to prevent harm or create a safer environment, it's acceptable. However, I don't think it's justifiable to monitor students' online activities to catch them in questionable behaviors. It's important to remember that once something is posted online, it's there forever, and it can come back to haunt them. I believe that the school officials were acting in good faith to ensure the safety of the students and the school.",
            "Initially, I wholeheartedly supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I believed we should retaliate and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, looking back, I think we were driven more by emotions and lacked a clear plan. We went in unprepared and naive about what we would encounter. I'm now firmly against the war as I don't believe we've achieved anything meaningful. The people in the region seem more interested in fighting each other than us, and their war tactics are vastly different from ours. I feel we were more driven by emotion and revenge than strategic planning. The Iraq War was declared partly due to public pressure, and while we didn't have a choice but to react, our approach was flawed. There was no clear objective or unity regarding what we were supposed to achieve. I don't think we can change their culture, and I'm doubtful we'll make enough progress to justify our prolonged presence. We're only hurting ourselves by staying. No, it's time to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. I've heard discussions about their dwindling membership, and I think it's due to their unaccepting stance on many issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their views are strong but somewhat outdated. If they embraced a more modern perspective, they might not face the same loss of followers. People are starting to disagree with the Church's positions on these subjects, causing some to turn away. For instance, if one is pro-choice or supports same-sex marriage, they may not feel comfortable following a church that opposes these views. I don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests, but I'm unsure if these changes would prevent the issues they currently face. The Church's loyalty to God, as they claim, should not preclude them from also having a family life. Everyone else manages to balance work and family life, so I see no reason why priests can't do the same.",
            "I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that sexual orientation isn't something people choose; it's just who they are. People shouldn't be judged or held accountable for it. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't. I think it's wrong for the government to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, I don't think the government should interfere because it's not a matter of national security or moral right. It's not the government's place to dictate who can and can't marry. It's not something that gay people should be penalized for, as it's a part of their nature.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized due to the lack of substantial arguments against it. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but they are different in numerous ways that prevent them from being considered the same. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Numerous civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should be extended to same-sex couples. For instance, a same-sex partner cannot visit or support a sick spouse in the hospital if not deemed \"family.\" I think it's absurd to deny this right to couples who will spend their lives together. Scientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is that people often conflate religious marriage with civil marriage. Same-sex couples are not requesting church ceremonies but rather legal recognition. If civil unions are acceptable, why not marriage? Segregation in the past was \"separate but unequal.\" Same-sex couples form relationships and have the same challenges and triumphs as heterosexual couples. Adoption and community concerns are valid, but evidence shows children are resilient and adaptable. School bullying is more of an issue than the children's upbringing. The federal government should make same-sex marriage legal nationwide. President Bush, influenced by his religious beliefs, opposes it, but moral viewpoints differ among individuals and groups. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country. People often hold negative views of homosexuality due to misconceptions about its origin, but psychological research contradicts these beliefs. People should rely on credible institutions rather than popular opinion to shape their views.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Let me clarify that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. While I believe it should not be available to the general public, it can be used for medicinal purposes. I understand that some illegal drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are beneficial and widely used in pharmacies. Similarly, I think marijuana can be beneficial and used for medical purposes, even though it is illegal. It's important to distinguish that marijuana's illegal status is not a reflection of its intrinsic value or potential benefits. Moreover, I don't believe marijuana is as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. I think it's crucial to remove the negative stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then gradually integrate it into legal frameworks. People should be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than in the past. As a child, I recall dressing up in cute outfits every Sunday when I attended church regularly. Now, I notice a more casual atmosphere, with services lasting only 30 minutes and people wearing beach clothes or jeans and khakis. The church I know has also grown more casual, even during morning masses. However, I don't know the politics of the church, so I can't comment on that.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been avoided by allowing female priests or priests to marry. Pedophilia is often a result of genetics, not marital status. Some men married with children may still be attracted to young kids, and I think the church couldn't have prevented these incidents. If they knew about them and covered them up, that would be wrong, but I don't believe they always did.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but the September 11th attacks had everyone shaken, and I believe we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, with the Bush administration falsely linking the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. This has always bothered me, and it still does. The administration lied to the American people, according to even Colin Powell, who later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented. I believe this is a serious issue and could potentially be an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration disregarded the constitution from the start, with a vengeance-driven agenda against Saddam Hussein, and possibly also aiming to secure more energy resources. Withdrawing now might lead to civil war, but the UN and US's plan to involve neighboring countries doesn't seem reliable in the long run due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the weak, divided interim government. The political process is chaotic, with radical elements vying for control.",

            "I truly don't think it's appropriate for a state to legalize or declare as legal something that the churches themselves should decide on. The Constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and any attempt to enforce rules over this would be a defiance of the constitutional principles. I believe that it's up to the churches to decide on such matters, and not the government. It's important to note that the vast majority of Catholics and Christians in the United States are against it, except in a few specific areas like Boston. The push for an amendment to make this illegal seems to be motivated by personal religious beliefs, which is not a valid reason for government intervention. I don't see how this would positively impact the economy or society. Therefore, I don't feel it's right for the government to be involved in this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nWell, to begin with, I believe the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, which in reality had little to do with Iraq. They exploited the public's anger and outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally oppose wars, especially preventive ones, and I think the government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the Vietnam War. The war in Iraq, like Vietnam, resulted in a significant loss of American lives and the removal of the Iraqi government. The government seemed unprepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a long, challenging process.\n\nThe government should have planned better for all possible outcomes and prepared for the long-term commitment required to stabilize a post-war country. The U.S. has been in Iraq for several years, and the conflict remains unresolved. I believe the government's initial portrayal of the war was misleading, making it seem like a short, successful campaign. The reality, however, is that establishing democracy is a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have supported George Bush if I could vote, mainly because I wanted him to finish what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult due to the high number of American casualties and the question of how much risk it's worth to establish a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, it's unclear why Iraq was the focus when other countries with similar issues have not been targeted.\n\nThe primary reason for invading Iraq was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. Other nations with confirmed weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, have not been targeted. This raises concerns about the honesty and thoroughness of the government's decision-making process.\n\nI hope the conflict ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm not optimistic about it happening anytime soon.",
            "I'm in favor of gay marriage. I've always held this view. I truly believe it's a personal choice, and research is increasingly suggesting it's more biological than sociological. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to deny people rights over something beyond their control, which seems inhuman to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and the government shouldn't interfere in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who function just like any other family, despite not being married due to the law. I think it's absurd for Bush to try to interpret the definition of marriage according to his beliefs. I've heard and read from many sources that being gay might be predisposed due to brain chemistry, not societal influences. It's just as personal and private as a heterosexual marriage. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to marry, it becomes a public affair. I believe it should be a personal, private matter, not a public or national issue.",
            "When you post something online, you're putting it out in a public forum. Everyone can see it, including people who might not have anything to do with you. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this personally. Once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing dangerous topics like bomb threats or shootings. If you're friends with someone on a social media platform like Myspace, they'll see your posts, and the school might too. If authorities hear about something potentially harmful, they can't ignore it, even if it might just be a joke gone wrong. Once something is online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. People can't control what others think or do with the information they find. While school officials shouldn't be friends with students online, if something dangerous comes to their attention, it's their job to take it seriously. Monitoring private conversations isn't appropriate, but if information is brought to their attention, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake profiles to monitor students, and I, as an R.A., wouldn't friend residents to keep track of their online activities. It's not my responsibility or desired to know what they're doing on social media.",
            "The war seems to have dragged on excessively. Initially, the aim was commendable, with the goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have strayed from this original purpose and are now involved in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. The motives behind the war may have been dubious, possibly influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. At the outset, the war served as a declaration of intent, but the prolonged conflict has blurred that purpose. The war has become an end in itself, and it's unclear if our initial goals were ever achieved. It's been going on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take control of its own affairs. We've been spending billions on this war at the expense of addressing our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own country and not on prolonged wars. It's time to end this conflict and redirect our resources towards our own pressing needs.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that something was prevented because someone found information online about it. Isn't that an invasion of privacy? When you post information on the internet, it's generally available for everyone to see, especially on platforms like Myspace. While you may need to be friends with someone to view their profile, if you give them permission to see it, it means you've accepted that trade-off. Therefore, when you put information online, you should understand that many people will see it. In this case, I believe it was good that someone found the information and prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nHowever, constantly monitoring everyone's profiles is not practical or fair, as it could lead to discrimination. It's important to consider the context in which the profile was found, whether someone was actively looking for evidence or just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that I know there are creepy people who can access my information. I've seen a TV show where a man easily found a girl's screen name and met her in less than a minute. This raises concerns about privacy and the ease with which people can gather personal information. I try to limit what I post, but I also want to maintain my online presence to communicate with friends. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've also heard that in high school, some students were banned from using Myspace by their school, which I found odd. I'm not sure how school officials have the right to restrict students' online activities. It seems like a privacy issue, but I'm not sure about the specifics.",
            "I have a few things to say about the Iraq War, but I feel uncomfortable doing so. I don't want to join those who claim they were against it from the start, as it's not really relevant now. The general consensus, except within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea. Polls show that 75-80% of people worldwide, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. The situation has been a disaster from the beginning and will continue to be so if we stay. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is too great for us to impose our views on them. Saddam was bad, but the potential consequences of invading had to be weighed against the benefits. I don't see any reason for us to stay. The administration may have reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any compelling ones. I'm open to a gradual withdrawal, but I think we should leave now. Eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year. We should respect their wishes. Leaving now would make us the good guys, even if we can't be the heroes we'd like to be.",
            "Yes, I do indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not just about women; it also extends to certain professions and societal expectations. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" where, despite being qualified, they may not be promoted to higher positions due to historical biases that favor men in leadership roles. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home with their children face societal disapproval and are often seen as less capable because of archaic gender roles. In the fashion industry, men are sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously if they're straight, as they're perceived as not understanding fashion from a woman's perspective. Discrimination isn't limited to gender; it also arises from one's background and education level. Ensuring equality is a gradual process, but progress is being made as more women are entering higher positions and societal attitudes are slowly changing. However, rushing these changes would only meet with resistance, so a balanced approach is key.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t make it legal. They decriminalized it, reducing the offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge with potential jail time. If someone gets caught, the penalty is like a citation, not a full arrest. While this change might be beneficial for job applications and other areas where criminal charges can be detrimental, the societal perception of marijuana use and its potential consequences on behavior and lifestyle remain significant concerns. Decriminalization can also save money for local governments by reducing the need for arrests, trials, and incarceration. However, not all communities are willing to make this change, especially those with strong anti-marijuana sentiments. In more liberal places like Denver, decriminalization has been well-received, allowing the city to allocate more funds to education and social programs. While marijuana should not be made readily available like cigarettes, it’s important to consider the potential financial benefits of decriminalization. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects, their impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people may use substances responsibly, while others may not. Therefore, it's difficult to generalize the effects of substances.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nMany of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing these things for a long time\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to have a strong connection to tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible and adapt to change\nUm\nMany Catholics believe they must attend church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey adhere strictly to how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church can be harsh towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't accept people who aren't completely Catholic\nAnd\nThey also don't accept people of other religions\nUm\nFor example\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nMy mother was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my father's religion\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat's not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat's a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it's so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say if one side is correct or incorrect. However, I do think this is the most challenging topic we're currently dealing with. It's difficult to address the separation of church and state and how to define marriage without upsetting someone. I'm not sure whether all civil unions should be seen as marriage, or how the government should classify them. After all, people wouldn't get special treatment or recognition for being married if they were just baptized. Therefore, I believe that couples who are married should be seen as in a civil union. That's what it is - two people united together. So, if all states can agree on a logical approach, they should work towards making it a federal law. However, I think it's ridiculous to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. It's not a pressing enough issue to warrant such a significant change.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so I must admit that the topic of homosexuality is a bit ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, and I feel that the decision should be left to each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nA lot of states are predominantly Democratic, and in these states, there's likely to be support for gay marriage. If you're living in a state that supports it, it's not fair to disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect that.\n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be decided on a state-by-state basis. I don't believe that the current president should be able to impose his views on all the states. Each state should make its own decision, as they will be the ones affected by it.\n\nI don't think it's fair for the president to decide how every state should run, especially since he won't be in office for much longer. If a new president from a different party changes their mind on the issue, it could just go back and forth. Therefore, it's best to leave the decision up to each individual state.",
            "Let's discuss the matter at hand. I don't entirely agree with the notion that Myspace is private. By definition, a bulletin board is meant for public viewing. If a student posts anything on the internet, they should be aware that it's visible to others, including school officials. They have every right to see it, even if it's not posted under the school's name, as they can access it from their personal devices. However, if the purpose is to prevent a school shooting, then I believe it's justified. School officials should only monitor students if they have reason to believe it's for the safety of the students and the school. Constantly monitoring students without cause is an invasion of privacy. I wouldn't expect students to post something with the intent of getting caught, and the same goes for school officials. If they're monitoring to prevent harm or create a safer environment, it's acceptable. However, I don't think it's justifiable to monitor students' online activities to catch them in questionable behaviors. It's important to remember that once something is posted online, it's there forever, and it can come back to haunt them. I believe that the school officials were acting in good faith to ensure the safety of the students and the school.",
            "Initially, I wholeheartedly supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I believed we should retaliate and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, looking back, I think we were driven more by emotions and lacked a clear plan. We went in unprepared and naive about what we would encounter. I'm now firmly against the war as I don't believe we've achieved anything meaningful. The people in the region seem more interested in fighting each other than us, and their war tactics are vastly different from ours. I feel we were more driven by emotion and revenge than strategic planning. The Iraq War was declared partly due to public pressure, and while we didn't have a choice but to react, our approach was flawed. There was no clear objective or unity regarding what we were supposed to achieve. I don't think we can change their culture, and I'm doubtful we'll make enough progress to justify our prolonged presence. We're only hurting ourselves by staying. No, it's time to leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe the Catholic Church needs to adapt in several ways. I've heard discussions about their dwindling membership, and I think it's due to their unaccepting stance on many issues, such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. Their views are strong but somewhat outdated. If they embraced a more modern perspective, they might not face the same loss of followers. People are starting to disagree with the Church's positions on these subjects, causing some to turn away. For instance, if one is pro-choice or supports same-sex marriage, they may not feel comfortable following a church that opposes these views. I don't see a reason why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests, but I'm unsure if these changes would prevent the issues they currently face. The Church's loyalty to God, as they claim, should not preclude them from also having a family life. Everyone else manages to balance work and family life, so I see no reason why priests can't do the same.",
            "I don't have a problem with gay marriage. I believe that sexual orientation isn't something people choose; it's just who they are. People shouldn't be judged or held accountable for it. It's not fair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't. I think it's wrong for the government to restrict marriage based on sexual orientation.\n\nMoreover, I don't think the government should interfere because it's not a matter of national security or moral right. It's not the government's place to dictate who can and can't marry. It's not something that gay people should be penalized for, as it's a part of their nature.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized due to the lack of substantial arguments against it. Many people argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but they are different in numerous ways that prevent them from being considered the same. It's like comparing apples to oranges. Numerous civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, should be extended to same-sex couples. For instance, a same-sex partner cannot visit or support a sick spouse in the hospital if not deemed \"family.\" I think it's absurd to deny this right to couples who will spend their lives together. Scientific studies show that same-sex couples have the same relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The primary issue is that people often conflate religious marriage with civil marriage. Same-sex couples are not requesting church ceremonies but rather legal recognition. If civil unions are acceptable, why not marriage? Segregation in the past was \"separate but unequal.\" Same-sex couples form relationships and have the same challenges and triumphs as heterosexual couples. Adoption and community concerns are valid, but evidence shows children are resilient and adaptable. School bullying is more of an issue than the children's upbringing. The federal government should make same-sex marriage legal nationwide. President Bush, influenced by his religious beliefs, opposes it, but moral viewpoints differ among individuals and groups. It's hypocritical for the government to enforce religious standards on the entire country. People often hold negative views of homosexuality due to misconceptions about its origin, but psychological research contradicts these beliefs. People should rely on credible institutions rather than popular opinion to shape their views.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Let me clarify that just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. While I believe it should not be available to the general public, it can be used for medicinal purposes. I understand that some illegal drugs like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are beneficial and widely used in pharmacies. Similarly, I think marijuana can be beneficial and used for medical purposes, even though it is illegal. It's important to distinguish that marijuana's illegal status is not a reflection of its intrinsic value or potential benefits. Moreover, I don't believe marijuana is as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine. I think it's crucial to remove the negative stigma surrounding marijuana first, and then gradually integrate it into legal frameworks. People should be able to use it responsibly, especially for medical purposes.",
            "I believe the church has adapted to the 21st century, becoming less strict than in the past. As a child, I recall dressing up in cute outfits every Sunday when I attended church regularly. Now, I notice a more casual atmosphere, with services lasting only 30 minutes and people wearing beach clothes or jeans and khakis. The church I know has also grown more casual, even during morning masses. However, I don't know the politics of the church, so I can't comment on that.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think these issues could have been avoided by allowing female priests or priests to marry. Pedophilia is often a result of genetics, not marital status. Some men married with children may still be attracted to young kids, and I think the church couldn't have prevented these incidents. If they knew about them and covered them up, that would be wrong, but I don't believe they always did.",
            "Initially, I was fine with the idea, but the September 11th attacks had everyone shaken, and I believe we invaded Iraq under false pretenses, with the Bush administration falsely linking the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction. This has always bothered me, and it still does. The administration lied to the American people, according to even Colin Powell, who later admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence he presented. I believe this is a serious issue and could potentially be an impeachable offense. I think the Bush administration disregarded the constitution from the start, with a vengeance-driven agenda against Saddam Hussein, and possibly also aiming to secure more energy resources. Withdrawing now might lead to civil war, but the UN and US's plan to involve neighboring countries doesn't seem reliable in the long run due to Iraq's sovereignty issues and the weak, divided interim government. The political process is chaotic, with radical elements vying for control.",

            "I truly don't think it's appropriate for a state to legalize or declare as legal something that the churches themselves should decide on. The Constitution clearly states separation of church and state, and any attempt to enforce rules over this would be a defiance of the constitutional principles. I believe that it's up to the churches to decide on such matters, and not the government. It's important to note that the vast majority of Catholics and Christians in the United States are against it, except in a few specific areas like Boston. The push for an amendment to make this illegal seems to be motivated by personal religious beliefs, which is not a valid reason for government intervention. I don't see how this would positively impact the economy or society. Therefore, I don't feel it's right for the government to be involved in this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nWell, to begin with, I believe the government wasn't entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the September 11th terrorist attacks, which in reality had little to do with Iraq. They exploited the public's anger and outrage over the attacks to justify the invasion in 2003.\n\nI personally oppose wars, especially preventive ones, and I think the government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the Vietnam War. The war in Iraq, like Vietnam, resulted in a significant loss of American lives and the removal of the Iraqi government. The government seemed unprepared for the chaos and power vacuum that followed, and the effort to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a long, challenging process.\n\nThe government should have planned better for all possible outcomes and prepared for the long-term commitment required to stabilize a post-war country. The U.S. has been in Iraq for several years, and the conflict remains unresolved. I believe the government's initial portrayal of the war was misleading, making it seem like a short, successful campaign. The reality, however, is that establishing democracy is a complex and time-consuming process.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I would have supported George Bush if I could vote, mainly because I wanted him to finish what he started. However, the decision to continue the war is difficult due to the high number of American casualties and the question of how much risk it's worth to establish a free democratic Iraq. Moreover, it's unclear why Iraq was the focus when other countries with similar issues have not been targeted.\n\nThe primary reason for invading Iraq was the alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, which were never found. Other nations with confirmed weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, have not been targeted. This raises concerns about the honesty and thoroughness of the government's decision-making process.\n\nI hope the conflict ends soon and brings peace to Iraq, but I'm not optimistic about it happening anytime soon.",
            "I'm in favor of gay marriage. I've always held this view. I truly believe it's a personal choice, and research is increasingly suggesting it's more biological than sociological. Therefore, I don't think it's fair to deny people rights over something beyond their control, which seems inhuman to me. I've always been an advocate for gay marriage. I think politics and the government shouldn't interfere in this matter, as it's a personal and household issue, not a state-level one. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who function just like any other family, despite not being married due to the law. I think it's absurd for Bush to try to interpret the definition of marriage according to his beliefs. I've heard and read from many sources that being gay might be predisposed due to brain chemistry, not societal influences. It's just as personal and private as a heterosexual marriage. If a straight couple wants to get married, they can do so without anyone knowing, but if a gay couple wants to marry, it becomes a public affair. I believe it should be a personal, private matter, not a public or national issue.",
            "When you post something online, you're putting it out in a public forum. Everyone can see it, including people who might not have anything to do with you. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this personally. Once something is out there, it can shape people's opinions of you, especially if you're discussing dangerous topics like bomb threats or shootings. If you're friends with someone on a social media platform like Myspace, they'll see your posts, and the school might too. If authorities hear about something potentially harmful, they can't ignore it, even if it might just be a joke gone wrong. Once something is online, there's no expectation of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't post it. People can't control what others think or do with the information they find. While school officials shouldn't be friends with students online, if something dangerous comes to their attention, it's their job to take it seriously. Monitoring private conversations isn't appropriate, but if information is brought to their attention, they must act. Teachers shouldn't create fake profiles to monitor students, and I, as an R.A., wouldn't friend residents to keep track of their online activities. It's not my responsibility or desired to know what they're doing on social media.",
            "The war seems to have dragged on excessively. Initially, the aim was commendable, with the goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have strayed from this original purpose and are now involved in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. The motives behind the war may have been dubious, possibly influenced by George Bush's father's past disputes with Saddam Hussein. At the outset, the war served as a declaration of intent, but the prolonged conflict has blurred that purpose. The war has become an end in itself, and it's unclear if our initial goals were ever achieved. It's been going on too long, and it's time for the Iraqi government to take control of its own affairs. We've been spending billions on this war at the expense of addressing our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure. The money could be better spent on improving our own country and not on prolonged wars. It's time to end this conflict and redirect our resources towards our own pressing needs.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something? It seems that something was prevented because someone found information online about it. Isn't that an invasion of privacy? When you post information on the internet, it's generally available for everyone to see, especially on platforms like Myspace. While you may need to be friends with someone to view their profile, if you give them permission to see it, it means you've accepted that trade-off. Therefore, when you put information online, you should understand that many people will see it. In this case, I believe it was good that someone found the information and prevented a potential tragedy.\n\nHowever, constantly monitoring everyone's profiles is not practical or fair, as it could lead to discrimination. It's important to consider the context in which the profile was found, whether someone was actively looking for evidence or just happened to stumble upon it.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook, and it bothers me that I know there are creepy people who can access my information. I've seen a TV show where a man easily found a girl's screen name and met her in less than a minute. This raises concerns about privacy and the ease with which people can gather personal information. I try to limit what I post, but I also want to maintain my online presence to communicate with friends. It's a delicate balance.\n\nI've also heard that in high school, some students were banned from using Myspace by their school, which I found odd. I'm not sure how school officials have the right to restrict students' online activities. It seems like a privacy issue, but I'm not sure about the specifics.",
            "I have a few things to say about the Iraq War, but I feel uncomfortable doing so. I don't want to join those who claim they were against it from the start, as it's not really relevant now. The general consensus, except within the administration, is that the war was a bad idea. Polls show that 75-80% of people worldwide, including 80% of Iraqis and 70% of U.S. troops, think it was a mistake and that we should withdraw within a year. The situation has been a disaster from the beginning and will continue to be so if we stay. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is too great for us to impose our views on them. Saddam was bad, but the potential consequences of invading had to be weighed against the benefits. I don't see any reason for us to stay. The administration may have reasons for staying, but I haven't heard any compelling ones. I'm open to a gradual withdrawal, but I think we should leave now. Eighty percent of Iraqis want us to leave within the year. We should respect their wishes. Leaving now would make us the good guys, even if we can't be the heroes we'd like to be.",
            "Yes, I do indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a prominent issue in the United States. It's not just about women; it also extends to certain professions and societal expectations. For instance, women often face the \"glass ceiling\" where, despite being qualified, they may not be promoted to higher positions due to historical biases that favor men in leadership roles. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home with their children face societal disapproval and are often seen as less capable because of archaic gender roles. In the fashion industry, men are sometimes overlooked or not taken seriously if they're straight, as they're perceived as not understanding fashion from a woman's perspective. Discrimination isn't limited to gender; it also arises from one's background and education level. Ensuring equality is a gradual process, but progress is being made as more women are entering higher positions and societal attitudes are slowly changing. However, rushing these changes would only meet with resistance, so a balanced approach is key.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t make it legal. They decriminalized it, reducing the offense to a minor infraction like a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge with potential jail time. If someone gets caught, the penalty is like a citation, not a full arrest. While this change might be beneficial for job applications and other areas where criminal charges can be detrimental, the societal perception of marijuana use and its potential consequences on behavior and lifestyle remain significant concerns. Decriminalization can also save money for local governments by reducing the need for arrests, trials, and incarceration. However, not all communities are willing to make this change, especially those with strong anti-marijuana sentiments. In more liberal places like Denver, decriminalization has been well-received, allowing the city to allocate more funds to education and social programs. While marijuana should not be made readily available like cigarettes, it’s important to consider the potential financial benefits of decriminalization. Additionally, while both alcohol and marijuana can have negative effects, their impact varies greatly from person to person. Some people may use substances responsibly, while others may not. Therefore, it's difficult to generalize the effects of substances.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nMany of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nThey've been doing these things for a long time\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to have a strong connection to tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible and adapt to change\nUm\nMany Catholics believe they must attend church weekly\nAnd\nUm\nThey adhere strictly to how things should be done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel the Catholic Church can be harsh towards those who don't follow the doctrine perfectly\nAnd\nUm\nThey don't accept people who aren't completely Catholic\nAnd\nThey also don't accept people of other religions\nUm\nFor example\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nMy mother was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my father's religion\n\nAnd\nUm\nThat's not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe were always taught to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat's a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt's hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it's so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike pedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I haven't fully decided on this issue yet, so I can't say if one side is correct or incorrect. However, I do think this is the most challenging topic we're currently dealing with. It's difficult to address the separation of church and state and how to define marriage without upsetting someone. I'm not sure whether all civil unions should be seen as marriage, or how the government should classify them. After all, people wouldn't get special treatment or recognition for being married if they were just baptized. Therefore, I believe that couples who are married should be seen as in a civil union. That's what it is - two people united together. So, if all states can agree on a logical approach, they should work towards making it a federal law. However, I think it's ridiculous to amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. It's not a pressing enough issue to warrant such a significant change.",
            "I was brought up in a Christian household, so I must admit that the topic of homosexuality is a bit ambiguous for me. I have many gay friends, and while I may not necessarily agree with the lifestyle, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, and I feel that the decision should be left to each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nA lot of states are predominantly Democratic, and in these states, there's likely to be support for gay marriage. If you're living in a state that supports it, it's not fair to disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect that.\n\nI think that homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalization should be decided on a state-by-state basis. I don't believe that the current president should be able to impose his views on all the states. Each state should make its own decision, as they will be the ones affected by it.\n\nI don't think it's fair for the president to decide how every state should run, especially since he won't be in office for much longer. If a new president from a different party changes their mind on the issue, it could just go back and forth. Therefore, it's best to leave the decision up to each individual state.",
            "Let's discuss the matter at hand. I don't entirely agree with the notion that Myspace is private. By definition, a bulletin board is meant for public viewing. If a student posts anything on the internet, they should be aware that it's visible to others, including school officials. They have every right to see it, even if it's not posted under the school's name, as they can access it from their personal devices. However, if the purpose is to prevent a school shooting, then I believe it's justified. School officials should only monitor students if they have reason to believe it's for the safety of the students and the school. Constantly monitoring students without cause is an invasion of privacy. I wouldn't expect students to post something with the intent of getting caught, and the same goes for school officials. If they're monitoring to prevent harm or create a safer environment, it's acceptable. However, I don't think it's justifiable to monitor students' online activities to catch them in questionable behaviors. It's important to remember that once something is posted online, it's there forever, and it can come back to haunt them. I believe that the school officials were acting in good faith to ensure the safety of the students and the school.",
            "Initially, I wholeheartedly supported the war due to the personal impact of 9/11. I believed we should retaliate and cause as much disruption as they did here. However, looking back, I think we were driven more by emotions and lacked a clear plan. We went in unprepared and naive about what we would encounter. I'm now firmly against the war as I don't believe we've achieved anything meaningful. The people in the region seem more interested in fighting each other than us, and their war tactics are vastly different from ours. I feel we were more driven by emotion and revenge than strategic planning. The Iraq War was declared partly due to public pressure, and while we didn't have a choice but to react, our approach was flawed. There was no clear objective or unity regarding what we were supposed to achieve. I don't think we can change their culture, and I'm doubtful we'll make enough progress to justify our prolonged presence. We're only hurting ourselves by staying. No, it's time to leave."
