            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to remain relevant.  Many people are leaving the church because its stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is seen as outdated and inflexible. The church's strong, traditional views on these topics clash with the evolving views of society, leading to a disconnect with some members.  Allowing for more modern interpretations and perspectives, such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to be married, could help the church bridge this gap and avoid further decline in membership.",
            "I don't have a strong opinion on gay marriage, but I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry just because they are gay. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, so people shouldn't be held responsible for it. It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI think it's like being born straight or gay – it's not a decision you make. I don't believe the federal government should be involved in this issue because it's a personal matter and not a legal or moral issue.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people shouldn't be treated differently or punished for their sexual orientation.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there's no valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but I believe these relationships are fundamentally different.  They are like two sides of the same coin – distinct yet interconnected. \n\nLegalizing gay marriage grants them essential civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a partner of a gay couple may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized partner or make medical decisions because they lack legal recognition.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nIt's important to understand that gay couples are seeking a legal document from the government, not religious approval. They are asking for equal recognition under the law, not an endorsement by any particular faith.  \n\nConcerns about adoption and community impacts are unfounded. Children of gay couples thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nUltimately, this debate boils down to fairness and equality. The government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, rooted in religious beliefs, is inconsistent with the separation of church and state.  \n\nIt's crucial to base our policies on evidence and reason, not prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that homosexuality is a psychological disorder. We should rely on scientific research and expert opinions, not stereotypes and cultural biases.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. While I strongly oppose making illegal drugs widely accessible to the public, I support their use for medicinal purposes. Many controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin are legally used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits. It's illogical to deny these potential benefits based solely on societal stigma surrounding marijuana. \n\nI believe marijuana should be approached gradually, with its legal status evolving over time to allow for responsible use. While alcohol can also be abused, its current legal status doesn't necessarily make it a worse substance.  \n\nThe negative image surrounding marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and removing this stigma could encourage responsible use, particularly for medical applications.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in recent times, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe that younger generations are catered to with shorter, more casual services. While acknowledging the church's past strictness, they see these adaptations as positive.  \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, the speaker doubts that allowing female priests or marriage would have prevented these issues. They argue that pedophilia is rooted in individual genetics and personality, rather than celibacy or marital status. They believe those with such inclinations would still act on them regardless of their marital or professional status. \n\nThe speaker suggests that individuals who desire marriage and religious practice might consider other faiths that allow for both.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, arguing that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking it to 9/11 and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. They believe these actions constitute malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. The speaker also criticizes the administration's disregard for the Constitution and their perceived intent to go to war. They suggest that President Bush had personal animosity towards Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's presidency and ulterior motives related to energy resources.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the US withdrew immediately, the speaker expresses concern about the proposed solution of a coalition of regional nations stabilizing Iraq. They worry this will further complicate the situation by raising issues of Iraqi sovereignty and potentially exacerbating political instability.\n\nThe speaker points to the ineffective Iraqi Parliament, the Prime Minister's limited control, and the prominence of radical factions like al-Sadr's party as evidence of the ongoing political turmoil. They conclude with a pessimistic outlook on the situation, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of the Iraqi political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty about the War in Iraq, feeling it lacks a clear purpose and is driven by a desire for revenge after the 9/11 attacks. They question the justification for ongoing US involvement, citing the goal of establishing democracy and securing oil resources, while acknowledging the negative consequences for Iraqis and the potential for resentment. They struggle with the conflicting perspectives of supporting troops while recognizing the war's destructive impact on Iraqi society and culture. The speaker ultimately believes the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, potentially exacerbating tensions and hindering lasting peace.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere with religious practices, citing the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate on this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious viewpoint over others, as demonstrated by the push for an amendment based on the personal beliefs of a Catholic individual.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any attempt to ban the practice would be discriminatory and potentially harmful to society. They believe the decision regarding its legality should rest solely with the churches themselves, as it is a matter of personal faith and conscience.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They strongly oppose war, especially preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes. The speaker criticizes the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion, the removal of the Iraqi government, and the inability to create a stable democracy. They argue that the US government underestimated the challenges of implementing democracy in Iraq and deceived the public about the war's swift and successful outcome. The speaker acknowledges the dilemma of leaving Iraq after the US has been involved for so long, but also expresses concern over the high number of American casualties and the questionable motivations behind the war, particularly the potential role of oil resources. They question the US government's decision-making process, citing the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq and the silence regarding North Korea's known nuclear program. Ultimately, the speaker expresses a desire for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a matter of personal preference, and there's increasing evidence that sexual orientation is biological rather than sociological.  Taking away rights from people based on something they have no control over, like their sexual orientation, is inhumane. I believe government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, individual decision, not a public issue.\n\nI know several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, despite not being legally married.  It's unfair that they can't have the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples. I think it's inappropriate for politicians like President Bush to try to define marriage according to their own beliefs.\n\nScientific research suggests that homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly linked to brain chemistry. This is different from sociological explanations that suggest sexual orientation is influenced by upbringing or environment. \n\nFurthermore, marriage should be a private matter. Heterosexual couples can easily get married without any public attention, but gay couples face media scrutiny and social pressure. Marriage equality should be a personal choice, not a subject of public debate or government control.",
            "Sharing content online makes it public and visible to everyone.  As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've encountered situations where online posts have impacted people's perceptions. If you post about potentially harmful actions, like violence or threats, someone might take it seriously and report it, leading to consequences. Schools have a responsibility to address such concerns, even if the post was intended as a joke, as they need to ensure student safety. \n\nWhile there's no expectation of privacy on public platforms, it's important to consider the potential impact of your online presence. If you don't want something to be seen or interpreted in a certain way, it's best not to share it online.  \n\nIt's also crucial to remember that school officials shouldn't be overly intrusive by monitoring students' private online activity. However, if a concerning post is brought to their attention by someone with access to it, they have a responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action. The line blurs when school officials impersonate students or engage in excessive monitoring, which crosses ethical boundaries.",
            "The speaker believes the war has been prolonged unnecessarily. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, the speaker feels that objective has been lost. They suspect the war's continuation is driven by a desire to assert global dominance rather than any genuine commitment to democracy. The speaker also questions the initial motives, suggesting a possible connection to personal vendettas from George Bush Sr. \n\nAlthough the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country under tyranny as justifiable, they argue that the purpose has become distorted over time. They feel the war is now driven by a need to achieve victory, regardless of the original cause, and that the prolonged conflict has become detrimental to the US economy. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that the billions spent on the war could be better allocated to domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They believe the war is no longer serving a meaningful purpose and should end, allowing the citizens of the war-torn country to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The conversation centers around the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace.  While acknowledging that information shared online is generally public, the speaker raises concerns about the potential for misuse and invasion of privacy. They discuss instances where someone might stumble upon concerning information on a profile and potentially prevent harm, but also question the feasibility and ethicality of actively monitoring student profiles for potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experiences with Facebook, highlighting the discomfort of knowing that strangers can access personal information and potentially exploit it. They mention a news story about a man who easily obtained personal details from a girl's profile and used it to contact her, emphasizing the risks associated with online interactions. \n\nFinally, the speaker reflects on the controversy surrounding schools banning Myspace, questioning the authority of institutions to dictate students' online activity and expressing uncertainty about the legality of such restrictions.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake from the beginning, citing widespread public opinion against it both domestically and internationally. They argue that the war has been a disaster and that pulling out is also likely to be challenging.  The speaker believes the cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East make it difficult for American administrations to understand the region and impose their own ideals. While acknowledging that Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading another country. \n\nThe speaker believes the U.S. should leave Iraq as soon as possible, citing polls showing a strong desire for withdrawal among Iraqi citizens. They argue that if the U.S. asks the Iraqi people if they want them to stay and they say no, it would be a legitimate reason for withdrawal. While acknowledging that the U.S. will likely never be seen as \"the good guys\" in the Middle East, they believe leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just about women; it also affects men depending on their field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal biases. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home can be judged and stereotyped. In industries like fashion, men may be met with skepticism because of preconceived notions about masculinity.  However, gradual change is occurring. More women are attaining leadership positions, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, and society is slowly challenging traditional gender roles. While change is slow, continued efforts to highlight the strengths and contributions of individuals regardless of gender or background are crucial.  Additionally, discrimination can stem from factors beyond gender, such as socioeconomic background or regional accents, further emphasizing the need for inclusivity and understanding.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They explain that decriminalization reduces possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a lesser offense, akin to a traffic ticket. While decriminalization removes some of the severe legal consequences associated with drug charges, it doesn't entirely eliminate future ramifications, particularly for job applications.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the financial implications of decriminalization, arguing that it can save municipalities money by reducing the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. They suggest that cities with more liberal viewpoints, like Denver, may be more receptive to decriminalization due to the potential financial benefits, allowing them to allocate resources to other important areas like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that complete legalization of marijuana raises concerns about its widespread accessibility and potential negative societal impacts, comparing it to the normalization of cigarette smoking. They express apprehension about the normalization of marijuana use in public spaces and the potential for increased instances of driving under the influence.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the subjective nature of drug effects, stating that both alcohol and marijuana have adverse consequences, though they manifest differently in individuals. They emphasize the variability in people's reactions to substances, highlighting the challenges of making generalizations about their overall impact.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has both positive and negative aspects. \n\nWhile I appreciate its emphasis on tradition, I also think it's important for institutions to adapt to change. One issue I have is the Church's strict adherence to doctrine and its perceived intolerance towards those who don't perfectly conform or belong to other religions.  \n\nFor example, my parents' marriage was denied in the Catholic Church because my father was Episcopalian, which demonstrates a lack of acceptance towards other faiths. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, creating a hypocritical situation. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that some Catholic teachings are outdated and the Church clings to them despite inconsistencies with modern values. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it could be beneficial, but it likely wouldn't prevent child abuse as that is a separate issue rooted in individual behavior rather than marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue yet, so I can't say definitively which side is right or wrong. However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today. Balancing the separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is incredibly delicate and easily leads to offense. \n\nI think all civil unions should be treated equally, regardless of religious or societal classifications.  The government shouldn't get involved in defining marriage based on religious doctrine, just as they don't for baptisms or other religious practices. If two people enter into a civil union, it should be recognized as such without further scrutiny.\n\nIdeally, if states can reach a consensus on a fair approach to same-sex marriage, they should push for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for issues that, while important to some, don't warrant such a significant change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legal. I think this issue should be decided at a state level rather than nationally.  \n\nDifferent states have diverse political leanings. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and individuals living in those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I believe all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal opportunities.  Therefore, I support legalizing same-sex marriage based on the discretion of each state.  \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't believe he should impose his views on the entire country, as each state has the right to govern itself.  \n\nFurthermore, the political landscape is constantly changing. If a future president lifts the ban, it will create a back-and-forth situation. It's more sensible to let each state decide on this issue, as they will be the ones living with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that Myspace being a public platform means that school officials have the right to access student posts, even if they aren't using the school's name. They argue that since anything on the internet is accessible, students should expect their posts to be seen by others, including school officials.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that searching for information about student misconduct is an invasion of privacy, but justifies school officials' actions if it prevents harm or improves school safety. They compare it to the measures taken after the terrorist attacks, where drills and security measures were implemented to ensure student safety. Ultimately, the speaker concludes that school officials' actions, though potentially controversial, are justifiable if they aim to prevent tragedies like Columbine.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about inflicting the same pain they caused us. However, I believe the intense emotions surrounding the event led to overlooking long-term consequences and a lack of preparedness. We went in without a clear plan and, in my view, it backfired.\n\nWhile I initially supported the war, I'm now strongly against it. I don't see it accomplishing anything.  If the Iraqi people continue to be divided, they won't be able to effectively fight us. I've become emotionally detached from the situation, feeling a lack of empathy for the people involved.\n\nI realize we went into the war unprepared, unaware of the challenges we would face. Their approach to war is vastly different from ours; they are more brutal and seem driven by a desire to expel us rather than improve their country.\n\nI believe we should withdraw and let them resolve their own issues. The initial motivation seemed to be revenge, fueled by public sentiment and President Bush's desire to act decisively. \n\nAlthough I understand the need to respond to the attacks, I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan. There was a lack of unity and clear objectives, which ultimately hindered our efforts.\n\nI think we went in driven by anger and emotion, which has only perpetuated the conflict. I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or values. Progress has been made, but not enough to justify our continued presence. I fear that once we leave, the situation will collapse, and our prolonged involvement is ultimately self-defeating."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to remain relevant.  Many people are leaving the church because its stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is seen as outdated and inflexible. The church's strong, traditional views on these topics clash with the evolving views of society, leading to a disconnect with some members.  Allowing for more modern interpretations and perspectives, such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to be married, could help the church bridge this gap and avoid further decline in membership.",
            "I don't have a strong opinion on gay marriage, but I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry just because they are gay. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, so people shouldn't be held responsible for it. It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI think it's like being born straight or gay – it's not a decision you make. I don't believe the federal government should be involved in this issue because it's a personal matter and not a legal or moral issue.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people shouldn't be treated differently or punished for their sexual orientation.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there's no valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but I believe these relationships are fundamentally different.  They are like two sides of the same coin – distinct yet interconnected. \n\nLegalizing gay marriage grants them essential civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a partner of a gay couple may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized partner or make medical decisions because they lack legal recognition.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nIt's important to understand that gay couples are seeking a legal document from the government, not religious approval. They are asking for equal recognition under the law, not an endorsement by any particular faith.  \n\nConcerns about adoption and community impacts are unfounded. Children of gay couples thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nUltimately, this debate boils down to fairness and equality. The government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, rooted in religious beliefs, is inconsistent with the separation of church and state.  \n\nIt's crucial to base our policies on evidence and reason, not prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that homosexuality is a psychological disorder. We should rely on scientific research and expert opinions, not stereotypes and cultural biases.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. While I strongly oppose making illegal drugs widely accessible to the public, I support their use for medicinal purposes. Many controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin are legally used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits. It's illogical to deny these potential benefits based solely on societal stigma surrounding marijuana. \n\nI believe marijuana should be approached gradually, with its legal status evolving over time to allow for responsible use. While alcohol can also be abused, its current legal status doesn't necessarily make it a worse substance.  \n\nThe negative image surrounding marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and removing this stigma could encourage responsible use, particularly for medical applications.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in recent times, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe that younger generations are catered to with shorter, more casual services. While acknowledging the church's past strictness, they see these adaptations as positive.  \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, the speaker doubts that allowing female priests or marriage would have prevented these issues. They argue that pedophilia is rooted in individual genetics and personality, rather than celibacy or marital status. They believe those with such inclinations would still act on them regardless of their marital or professional status. \n\nThe speaker suggests that individuals who desire marriage and religious practice might consider other faiths that allow for both.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, arguing that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking it to 9/11 and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. They believe these actions constitute malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. The speaker also criticizes the administration's disregard for the Constitution and their perceived intent to go to war. They suggest that President Bush had personal animosity towards Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's presidency and ulterior motives related to energy resources.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the US withdrew immediately, the speaker expresses concern about the proposed solution of a coalition of regional nations stabilizing Iraq. They worry this will further complicate the situation by raising issues of Iraqi sovereignty and potentially exacerbating political instability.\n\nThe speaker points to the ineffective Iraqi Parliament, the Prime Minister's limited control, and the prominence of radical factions like al-Sadr's party as evidence of the ongoing political turmoil. They conclude with a pessimistic outlook on the situation, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of the Iraqi political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty about the War in Iraq, feeling it lacks a clear purpose and is driven by a desire for revenge after the 9/11 attacks. They question the justification for ongoing US involvement, citing the goal of establishing democracy and securing oil resources, while acknowledging the negative consequences for Iraqis and the potential for resentment. They struggle with the conflicting perspectives of supporting troops while recognizing the war's destructive impact on Iraqi society and culture. The speaker ultimately believes the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, potentially exacerbating tensions and hindering lasting peace.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere with religious practices, citing the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate on this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious viewpoint over others, as demonstrated by the push for an amendment based on the personal beliefs of a Catholic individual.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any attempt to ban the practice would be discriminatory and potentially harmful to society. They believe the decision regarding its legality should rest solely with the churches themselves, as it is a matter of personal faith and conscience.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They strongly oppose war, especially preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes. The speaker criticizes the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion, the removal of the Iraqi government, and the inability to create a stable democracy. They argue that the US government underestimated the challenges of implementing democracy in Iraq and deceived the public about the war's swift and successful outcome. The speaker acknowledges the dilemma of leaving Iraq after the US has been involved for so long, but also expresses concern over the high number of American casualties and the questionable motivations behind the war, particularly the potential role of oil resources. They question the US government's decision-making process, citing the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq and the silence regarding North Korea's known nuclear program. Ultimately, the speaker expresses a desire for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a matter of personal preference, and there's increasing evidence that sexual orientation is biological rather than sociological.  Taking away rights from people based on something they have no control over, like their sexual orientation, is inhumane. I believe government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, individual decision, not a public issue.\n\nI know several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, despite not being legally married.  It's unfair that they can't have the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples. I think it's inappropriate for politicians like President Bush to try to define marriage according to their own beliefs.\n\nScientific research suggests that homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly linked to brain chemistry. This is different from sociological explanations that suggest sexual orientation is influenced by upbringing or environment. \n\nFurthermore, marriage should be a private matter. Heterosexual couples can easily get married without any public attention, but gay couples face media scrutiny and social pressure. Marriage equality should be a personal choice, not a subject of public debate or government control.",
            "Sharing content online makes it public and visible to everyone.  As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've encountered situations where online posts have impacted people's perceptions. If you post about potentially harmful actions, like violence or threats, someone might take it seriously and report it, leading to consequences. Schools have a responsibility to address such concerns, even if the post was intended as a joke, as they need to ensure student safety. \n\nWhile there's no expectation of privacy on public platforms, it's important to consider the potential impact of your online presence. If you don't want something to be seen or interpreted in a certain way, it's best not to share it online.  \n\nIt's also crucial to remember that school officials shouldn't be overly intrusive by monitoring students' private online activity. However, if a concerning post is brought to their attention by someone with access to it, they have a responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action. The line blurs when school officials impersonate students or engage in excessive monitoring, which crosses ethical boundaries.",
            "The speaker believes the war has been prolonged unnecessarily. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, the speaker feels that objective has been lost. They suspect the war's continuation is driven by a desire to assert global dominance rather than any genuine commitment to democracy. The speaker also questions the initial motives, suggesting a possible connection to personal vendettas from George Bush Sr. \n\nAlthough the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country under tyranny as justifiable, they argue that the purpose has become distorted over time. They feel the war is now driven by a need to achieve victory, regardless of the original cause, and that the prolonged conflict has become detrimental to the US economy. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that the billions spent on the war could be better allocated to domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They believe the war is no longer serving a meaningful purpose and should end, allowing the citizens of the war-torn country to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The conversation centers around the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace.  While acknowledging that information shared online is generally public, the speaker raises concerns about the potential for misuse and invasion of privacy. They discuss instances where someone might stumble upon concerning information on a profile and potentially prevent harm, but also question the feasibility and ethicality of actively monitoring student profiles for potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experiences with Facebook, highlighting the discomfort of knowing that strangers can access personal information and potentially exploit it. They mention a news story about a man who easily obtained personal details from a girl's profile and used it to contact her, emphasizing the risks associated with online interactions. \n\nFinally, the speaker reflects on the controversy surrounding schools banning Myspace, questioning the authority of institutions to dictate students' online activity and expressing uncertainty about the legality of such restrictions.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake from the beginning, citing widespread public opinion against it both domestically and internationally. They argue that the war has been a disaster and that pulling out is also likely to be challenging.  The speaker believes the cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East make it difficult for American administrations to understand the region and impose their own ideals. While acknowledging that Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading another country. \n\nThe speaker believes the U.S. should leave Iraq as soon as possible, citing polls showing a strong desire for withdrawal among Iraqi citizens. They argue that if the U.S. asks the Iraqi people if they want them to stay and they say no, it would be a legitimate reason for withdrawal. While acknowledging that the U.S. will likely never be seen as \"the good guys\" in the Middle East, they believe leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just about women; it also affects men depending on their field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal biases. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home can be judged and stereotyped. In industries like fashion, men may be met with skepticism because of preconceived notions about masculinity.  However, gradual change is occurring. More women are attaining leadership positions, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, and society is slowly challenging traditional gender roles. While change is slow, continued efforts to highlight the strengths and contributions of individuals regardless of gender or background are crucial.  Additionally, discrimination can stem from factors beyond gender, such as socioeconomic background or regional accents, further emphasizing the need for inclusivity and understanding.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They explain that decriminalization reduces possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a lesser offense, akin to a traffic ticket. While decriminalization removes some of the severe legal consequences associated with drug charges, it doesn't entirely eliminate future ramifications, particularly for job applications.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the financial implications of decriminalization, arguing that it can save municipalities money by reducing the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. They suggest that cities with more liberal viewpoints, like Denver, may be more receptive to decriminalization due to the potential financial benefits, allowing them to allocate resources to other important areas like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that complete legalization of marijuana raises concerns about its widespread accessibility and potential negative societal impacts, comparing it to the normalization of cigarette smoking. They express apprehension about the normalization of marijuana use in public spaces and the potential for increased instances of driving under the influence.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the subjective nature of drug effects, stating that both alcohol and marijuana have adverse consequences, though they manifest differently in individuals. They emphasize the variability in people's reactions to substances, highlighting the challenges of making generalizations about their overall impact.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has both positive and negative aspects. \n\nWhile I appreciate its emphasis on tradition, I also think it's important for institutions to adapt to change. One issue I have is the Church's strict adherence to doctrine and its perceived intolerance towards those who don't perfectly conform or belong to other religions.  \n\nFor example, my parents' marriage was denied in the Catholic Church because my father was Episcopalian, which demonstrates a lack of acceptance towards other faiths. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, creating a hypocritical situation. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that some Catholic teachings are outdated and the Church clings to them despite inconsistencies with modern values. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it could be beneficial, but it likely wouldn't prevent child abuse as that is a separate issue rooted in individual behavior rather than marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue yet, so I can't say definitively which side is right or wrong. However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today. Balancing the separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is incredibly delicate and easily leads to offense. \n\nI think all civil unions should be treated equally, regardless of religious or societal classifications.  The government shouldn't get involved in defining marriage based on religious doctrine, just as they don't for baptisms or other religious practices. If two people enter into a civil union, it should be recognized as such without further scrutiny.\n\nIdeally, if states can reach a consensus on a fair approach to same-sex marriage, they should push for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for issues that, while important to some, don't warrant such a significant change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legal. I think this issue should be decided at a state level rather than nationally.  \n\nDifferent states have diverse political leanings. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and individuals living in those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I believe all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal opportunities.  Therefore, I support legalizing same-sex marriage based on the discretion of each state.  \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't believe he should impose his views on the entire country, as each state has the right to govern itself.  \n\nFurthermore, the political landscape is constantly changing. If a future president lifts the ban, it will create a back-and-forth situation. It's more sensible to let each state decide on this issue, as they will be the ones living with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that Myspace being a public platform means that school officials have the right to access student posts, even if they aren't using the school's name. They argue that since anything on the internet is accessible, students should expect their posts to be seen by others, including school officials.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that searching for information about student misconduct is an invasion of privacy, but justifies school officials' actions if it prevents harm or improves school safety. They compare it to the measures taken after the terrorist attacks, where drills and security measures were implemented to ensure student safety. Ultimately, the speaker concludes that school officials' actions, though potentially controversial, are justifiable if they aim to prevent tragedies like Columbine.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about inflicting the same pain they caused us. However, I believe the intense emotions surrounding the event led to overlooking long-term consequences and a lack of preparedness. We went in without a clear plan and, in my view, it backfired.\n\nWhile I initially supported the war, I'm now strongly against it. I don't see it accomplishing anything.  If the Iraqi people continue to be divided, they won't be able to effectively fight us. I've become emotionally detached from the situation, feeling a lack of empathy for the people involved.\n\nI realize we went into the war unprepared, unaware of the challenges we would face. Their approach to war is vastly different from ours; they are more brutal and seem driven by a desire to expel us rather than improve their country.\n\nI believe we should withdraw and let them resolve their own issues. The initial motivation seemed to be revenge, fueled by public sentiment and President Bush's desire to act decisively. \n\nAlthough I understand the need to respond to the attacks, I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan. There was a lack of unity and clear objectives, which ultimately hindered our efforts.\n\nI think we went in driven by anger and emotion, which has only perpetuated the conflict. I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or values. Progress has been made, but not enough to justify our continued presence. I fear that once we leave, the situation will collapse, and our prolonged involvement is ultimately self-defeating."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to remain relevant.  Many people are leaving the church because its stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is seen as outdated and inflexible. The church's strong, traditional views on these topics clash with the evolving views of society, leading to a disconnect with some members.  Allowing for more modern interpretations and perspectives, such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to be married, could help the church bridge this gap and avoid further decline in membership.",
            "I don't have a strong opinion on gay marriage, but I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry just because they are gay. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, so people shouldn't be held responsible for it. It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI think it's like being born straight or gay – it's not a decision you make. I don't believe the federal government should be involved in this issue because it's a personal matter and not a legal or moral issue.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people shouldn't be treated differently or punished for their sexual orientation.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there's no valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but I believe these relationships are fundamentally different.  They are like two sides of the same coin – distinct yet interconnected. \n\nLegalizing gay marriage grants them essential civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a partner of a gay couple may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized partner or make medical decisions because they lack legal recognition.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nIt's important to understand that gay couples are seeking a legal document from the government, not religious approval. They are asking for equal recognition under the law, not an endorsement by any particular faith.  \n\nConcerns about adoption and community impacts are unfounded. Children of gay couples thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nUltimately, this debate boils down to fairness and equality. The government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, rooted in religious beliefs, is inconsistent with the separation of church and state.  \n\nIt's crucial to base our policies on evidence and reason, not prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that homosexuality is a psychological disorder. We should rely on scientific research and expert opinions, not stereotypes and cultural biases.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. While I strongly oppose making illegal drugs widely accessible to the public, I support their use for medicinal purposes. Many controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin are legally used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits. It's illogical to deny these potential benefits based solely on societal stigma surrounding marijuana. \n\nI believe marijuana should be approached gradually, with its legal status evolving over time to allow for responsible use. While alcohol can also be abused, its current legal status doesn't necessarily make it a worse substance.  \n\nThe negative image surrounding marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and removing this stigma could encourage responsible use, particularly for medical applications.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in recent times, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe that younger generations are catered to with shorter, more casual services. While acknowledging the church's past strictness, they see these adaptations as positive.  \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, the speaker doubts that allowing female priests or marriage would have prevented these issues. They argue that pedophilia is rooted in individual genetics and personality, rather than celibacy or marital status. They believe those with such inclinations would still act on them regardless of their marital or professional status. \n\nThe speaker suggests that individuals who desire marriage and religious practice might consider other faiths that allow for both.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, arguing that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking it to 9/11 and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. They believe these actions constitute malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. The speaker also criticizes the administration's disregard for the Constitution and their perceived intent to go to war. They suggest that President Bush had personal animosity towards Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's presidency and ulterior motives related to energy resources.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the US withdrew immediately, the speaker expresses concern about the proposed solution of a coalition of regional nations stabilizing Iraq. They worry this will further complicate the situation by raising issues of Iraqi sovereignty and potentially exacerbating political instability.\n\nThe speaker points to the ineffective Iraqi Parliament, the Prime Minister's limited control, and the prominence of radical factions like al-Sadr's party as evidence of the ongoing political turmoil. They conclude with a pessimistic outlook on the situation, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of the Iraqi political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty about the War in Iraq, feeling it lacks a clear purpose and is driven by a desire for revenge after the 9/11 attacks. They question the justification for ongoing US involvement, citing the goal of establishing democracy and securing oil resources, while acknowledging the negative consequences for Iraqis and the potential for resentment. They struggle with the conflicting perspectives of supporting troops while recognizing the war's destructive impact on Iraqi society and culture. The speaker ultimately believes the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, potentially exacerbating tensions and hindering lasting peace.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere with religious practices, citing the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate on this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious viewpoint over others, as demonstrated by the push for an amendment based on the personal beliefs of a Catholic individual.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any attempt to ban the practice would be discriminatory and potentially harmful to society. They believe the decision regarding its legality should rest solely with the churches themselves, as it is a matter of personal faith and conscience.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They strongly oppose war, especially preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes. The speaker criticizes the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion, the removal of the Iraqi government, and the inability to create a stable democracy. They argue that the US government underestimated the challenges of implementing democracy in Iraq and deceived the public about the war's swift and successful outcome. The speaker acknowledges the dilemma of leaving Iraq after the US has been involved for so long, but also expresses concern over the high number of American casualties and the questionable motivations behind the war, particularly the potential role of oil resources. They question the US government's decision-making process, citing the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq and the silence regarding North Korea's known nuclear program. Ultimately, the speaker expresses a desire for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a matter of personal preference, and there's increasing evidence that sexual orientation is biological rather than sociological.  Taking away rights from people based on something they have no control over, like their sexual orientation, is inhumane. I believe government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, individual decision, not a public issue.\n\nI know several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, despite not being legally married.  It's unfair that they can't have the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples. I think it's inappropriate for politicians like President Bush to try to define marriage according to their own beliefs.\n\nScientific research suggests that homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly linked to brain chemistry. This is different from sociological explanations that suggest sexual orientation is influenced by upbringing or environment. \n\nFurthermore, marriage should be a private matter. Heterosexual couples can easily get married without any public attention, but gay couples face media scrutiny and social pressure. Marriage equality should be a personal choice, not a subject of public debate or government control.",
            "Sharing content online makes it public and visible to everyone.  As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've encountered situations where online posts have impacted people's perceptions. If you post about potentially harmful actions, like violence or threats, someone might take it seriously and report it, leading to consequences. Schools have a responsibility to address such concerns, even if the post was intended as a joke, as they need to ensure student safety. \n\nWhile there's no expectation of privacy on public platforms, it's important to consider the potential impact of your online presence. If you don't want something to be seen or interpreted in a certain way, it's best not to share it online.  \n\nIt's also crucial to remember that school officials shouldn't be overly intrusive by monitoring students' private online activity. However, if a concerning post is brought to their attention by someone with access to it, they have a responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action. The line blurs when school officials impersonate students or engage in excessive monitoring, which crosses ethical boundaries.",
            "The speaker believes the war has been prolonged unnecessarily. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, the speaker feels that objective has been lost. They suspect the war's continuation is driven by a desire to assert global dominance rather than any genuine commitment to democracy. The speaker also questions the initial motives, suggesting a possible connection to personal vendettas from George Bush Sr. \n\nAlthough the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country under tyranny as justifiable, they argue that the purpose has become distorted over time. They feel the war is now driven by a need to achieve victory, regardless of the original cause, and that the prolonged conflict has become detrimental to the US economy. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that the billions spent on the war could be better allocated to domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They believe the war is no longer serving a meaningful purpose and should end, allowing the citizens of the war-torn country to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The conversation centers around the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace.  While acknowledging that information shared online is generally public, the speaker raises concerns about the potential for misuse and invasion of privacy. They discuss instances where someone might stumble upon concerning information on a profile and potentially prevent harm, but also question the feasibility and ethicality of actively monitoring student profiles for potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experiences with Facebook, highlighting the discomfort of knowing that strangers can access personal information and potentially exploit it. They mention a news story about a man who easily obtained personal details from a girl's profile and used it to contact her, emphasizing the risks associated with online interactions. \n\nFinally, the speaker reflects on the controversy surrounding schools banning Myspace, questioning the authority of institutions to dictate students' online activity and expressing uncertainty about the legality of such restrictions.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake from the beginning, citing widespread public opinion against it both domestically and internationally. They argue that the war has been a disaster and that pulling out is also likely to be challenging.  The speaker believes the cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East make it difficult for American administrations to understand the region and impose their own ideals. While acknowledging that Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading another country. \n\nThe speaker believes the U.S. should leave Iraq as soon as possible, citing polls showing a strong desire for withdrawal among Iraqi citizens. They argue that if the U.S. asks the Iraqi people if they want them to stay and they say no, it would be a legitimate reason for withdrawal. While acknowledging that the U.S. will likely never be seen as \"the good guys\" in the Middle East, they believe leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just about women; it also affects men depending on their field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal biases. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home can be judged and stereotyped. In industries like fashion, men may be met with skepticism because of preconceived notions about masculinity.  However, gradual change is occurring. More women are attaining leadership positions, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, and society is slowly challenging traditional gender roles. While change is slow, continued efforts to highlight the strengths and contributions of individuals regardless of gender or background are crucial.  Additionally, discrimination can stem from factors beyond gender, such as socioeconomic background or regional accents, further emphasizing the need for inclusivity and understanding.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They explain that decriminalization reduces possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a lesser offense, akin to a traffic ticket. While decriminalization removes some of the severe legal consequences associated with drug charges, it doesn't entirely eliminate future ramifications, particularly for job applications.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the financial implications of decriminalization, arguing that it can save municipalities money by reducing the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. They suggest that cities with more liberal viewpoints, like Denver, may be more receptive to decriminalization due to the potential financial benefits, allowing them to allocate resources to other important areas like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that complete legalization of marijuana raises concerns about its widespread accessibility and potential negative societal impacts, comparing it to the normalization of cigarette smoking. They express apprehension about the normalization of marijuana use in public spaces and the potential for increased instances of driving under the influence.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the subjective nature of drug effects, stating that both alcohol and marijuana have adverse consequences, though they manifest differently in individuals. They emphasize the variability in people's reactions to substances, highlighting the challenges of making generalizations about their overall impact.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has both positive and negative aspects. \n\nWhile I appreciate its emphasis on tradition, I also think it's important for institutions to adapt to change. One issue I have is the Church's strict adherence to doctrine and its perceived intolerance towards those who don't perfectly conform or belong to other religions.  \n\nFor example, my parents' marriage was denied in the Catholic Church because my father was Episcopalian, which demonstrates a lack of acceptance towards other faiths. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, creating a hypocritical situation. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that some Catholic teachings are outdated and the Church clings to them despite inconsistencies with modern values. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it could be beneficial, but it likely wouldn't prevent child abuse as that is a separate issue rooted in individual behavior rather than marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue yet, so I can't say definitively which side is right or wrong. However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today. Balancing the separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is incredibly delicate and easily leads to offense. \n\nI think all civil unions should be treated equally, regardless of religious or societal classifications.  The government shouldn't get involved in defining marriage based on religious doctrine, just as they don't for baptisms or other religious practices. If two people enter into a civil union, it should be recognized as such without further scrutiny.\n\nIdeally, if states can reach a consensus on a fair approach to same-sex marriage, they should push for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for issues that, while important to some, don't warrant such a significant change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legal. I think this issue should be decided at a state level rather than nationally.  \n\nDifferent states have diverse political leanings. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and individuals living in those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I believe all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal opportunities.  Therefore, I support legalizing same-sex marriage based on the discretion of each state.  \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't believe he should impose his views on the entire country, as each state has the right to govern itself.  \n\nFurthermore, the political landscape is constantly changing. If a future president lifts the ban, it will create a back-and-forth situation. It's more sensible to let each state decide on this issue, as they will be the ones living with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that Myspace being a public platform means that school officials have the right to access student posts, even if they aren't using the school's name. They argue that since anything on the internet is accessible, students should expect their posts to be seen by others, including school officials.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that searching for information about student misconduct is an invasion of privacy, but justifies school officials' actions if it prevents harm or improves school safety. They compare it to the measures taken after the terrorist attacks, where drills and security measures were implemented to ensure student safety. Ultimately, the speaker concludes that school officials' actions, though potentially controversial, are justifiable if they aim to prevent tragedies like Columbine.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about inflicting the same pain they caused us. However, I believe the intense emotions surrounding the event led to overlooking long-term consequences and a lack of preparedness. We went in without a clear plan and, in my view, it backfired.\n\nWhile I initially supported the war, I'm now strongly against it. I don't see it accomplishing anything.  If the Iraqi people continue to be divided, they won't be able to effectively fight us. I've become emotionally detached from the situation, feeling a lack of empathy for the people involved.\n\nI realize we went into the war unprepared, unaware of the challenges we would face. Their approach to war is vastly different from ours; they are more brutal and seem driven by a desire to expel us rather than improve their country.\n\nI believe we should withdraw and let them resolve their own issues. The initial motivation seemed to be revenge, fueled by public sentiment and President Bush's desire to act decisively. \n\nAlthough I understand the need to respond to the attacks, I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan. There was a lack of unity and clear objectives, which ultimately hindered our efforts.\n\nI think we went in driven by anger and emotion, which has only perpetuated the conflict. I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or values. Progress has been made, but not enough to justify our continued presence. I fear that once we leave, the situation will collapse, and our prolonged involvement is ultimately self-defeating."
