            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The speaker feels that if the Church were more accepting of diverse viewpoints, it wouldn't face this decline in followers. \n\nThey also suggest that allowing female priests and married priests could help bridge the gap with modern society. While acknowledging that these changes might not have prevented past scandals, the speaker believes they could contribute to a more inclusive and relevant Church.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but deny that right to same-sex couples. It feels like a personal matter, and the federal government shouldn't intervene in people's lives regarding their relationships.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there are no compelling reasons against it. While some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, this is unfounded. Gay relationships are diverse and should not be conflated with heterosexual relationships.  \n\nDenying marriage equality to LGBTQ+ individuals deprives them of crucial civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a sick partner might be barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital due to legal limitations. \n\nScientific research shows that same-sex couples experience similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. Ultimately, marriage is a legal contract, not a religious sacrament, and the government should not interfere with personal choices in this regard.\n\nConcerns about adoption and societal impacts are often based on unfounded fears. Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The real issue often lies in societal prejudice and discrimination, as evidenced by instances of bullying and exclusion faced by children of LGBTQ+ parents. \n\nThe government should ensure equal rights for all its citizens, including LGBTQ+ individuals, by legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  It's hypocritical to oppose same-sex marriage while simultaneously upholding the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, demonstrating a selective application of religious values in public policy.\n\nFinally, the notion that homosexuality stems from psychological damage is scientifically inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and it's crucial to rely on evidence-based information rather than prejudices and unfounded beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't automatically mean it's harmful. I think making marijuana accessible for medicinal purposes is a good idea because its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply due to its legal status.  \n\nMany controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in pharmacies for their medicinal value.  It's unfair to deny marijuana the same consideration just because of societal stigma. We should embrace its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that alcohol can also be harmful if abused, I believe marijuana, if used responsibly, has less potential for abuse.  I think a gradual integration of marijuana into society, starting with legalizing it for medical purposes, would be beneficial. Removing the stigma surrounding marijuana is crucial to encouraging responsible use.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. However, it's not as dangerous as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal reasons.",

They observe a change in the atmosphere, with more casual dress and families arriving late to mass. While they acknowledge the church's stance on priestly celibacy, they don't believe allowing priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia, suggesting that it stems from individual predispositions rather than the lack of marriage. They argue that individuals with this inclination may still develop it even if married. The speaker also believes that genetics plays a role in pedophilia, making it difficult to conceal. They criticize the church for covering up instances of abuse but acknowledge that not all cases were necessarily known.",
            "The speaker expresses deep disapproval of the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses used by the Bush administration to justify invading Iraq. They criticize the administration for misleading the American people about the connection between Iraq, Osama Bin Laden, and 9/11, as well as their claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and possibly even an impeachable offense. \n\nThey also believe the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution and had a pre-existing intention to go to war.  The speaker suggests that the younger Bush's personal feelings towards Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and a desire to secure energy resources may have influenced the decision to invade. \n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the U.S. withdraws immediately, the speaker remains critical of the current political situation in Iraq. They express concerns about the UN and U.S. proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations taking control, fearing it will further complicate matters by undermining Iraqi sovereignty.  The speaker highlights the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi Parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the continued influence of radical factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, all of which contribute to the instability and uncertainty in the country.",
            "The speaker expresses a conflicted view on the War in Iraq. They believe it was initially motivated by a desire for revenge for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose, seeing it as an attempt to impose American democracy and access oil. They acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracy in Iraq and the potential negative consequences of both withdrawing or remaining. They also express concerns about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. While acknowledging the personal sacrifices of soldiers and the suffering of Iraqi civilians, they ultimately believe that the war is counterproductive and will likely lead to further instability and resentment towards the United States.",
            "The speaker firmly believes that the government should not be involved in legalizing or criminalizing certain practices, particularly those related to religion. They argue that the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the Constitution, prevents the government from imposing its will on religious beliefs. They feel that attempts to create a law or amendment regarding this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious perspective over others.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that religious decisions should be left to individual churches and denominations, as different faiths hold diverse views. They see the proposed amendment as a personal crusade driven by the initiator's own Catholic beliefs, rather than a legitimate societal concern. They believe it would be an unusual amendment, unlike others, which typically aim to restrict government power rather than individual freedoms. The speaker concludes that such an amendment is unnecessary and potentially beneficial to society.",
            "The speaker believes the US government was dishonest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They oppose preemptive war and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the US government for not anticipating the chaos and insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, arguing that the US attempted to deceive the public about the ease of establishing democracy in Iraq. \n\nThey acknowledge the difficulty of withdrawing from Iraq after years of involvement, but also question the high cost in American lives for a \"free democratic Iraq.\" The speaker further criticizes the US government's inconsistencies in dealing with other countries, like North Korea, which have weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that oil and resource control are more significant factors in US foreign policy. \n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses a hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has biological roots rather than being solely sociological. Denying individuals rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane.  \n\nI believe politics and government should stay out of this issue. Marriage is a personal and family matter, not a governmental one. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live and function like any other family, even though they can't marry. \n\nI think President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation are misguided. \n\nScientific evidence suggests that sexual orientation may have a biological basis, possibly even a chemical component in the brain, rather than being influenced by upbringing or environmental factors. \n\nOne of the key issues is the public scrutiny gay couples face when seeking to marry. While heterosexual couples can easily get married privately, gay couples' unions often become public events. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public and political one.",

Schools may be alerted to potentially dangerous content by students or concerned individuals. Since anything shared online is publicly accessible, there's a limited expectation of privacy.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of what you post online, as it can have real-world consequences. Schools should not actively monitor students' online activity, but they are obligated to take seriously any information brought to their attention that suggests a potential threat.",
            "The speaker believes the war has become too prolonged and has strayed from its original purpose. They initially supported the war as a means to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, they now feel that the goal has been obscured, and the war is perhaps driven by a desire to assert global dominance.  The speaker also questions the initial motivations, suggesting potential personal conflicts involving former President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein may have influenced the decision to go to war.\n\nWhile the speaker acknowledges the initial purpose of bringing democracy to the country, they argue that the war has lost its justification. They believe the initial goal was achieved in the early stages, and the prolonged conflict feels unnecessary.  The speaker emphasizes that the war has become financially draining, diverting resources from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. They feel the money spent on the war could be better allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns.",

They acknowledge that information shared online is generally public, but question the extent to which someone should be able to monitor profiles for potential threats. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of discrimination and the impracticality of having someone constantly watch profiles. They also share personal experiences with online privacy concerns, mentioning instances where strangers knew personal details about them from their social media presence. The speaker concludes by mentioning a situation where a high school banned students from using Myspace, questioning the school's authority to restrict students' access to the platform.",
            "I feel hesitant to discuss the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it. However, it's impossible to ignore the overwhelming global consensus that the war was a mistake, including within Iraq itself and even among U.S. troops currently stationed there.  \n\nWhile I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, I believe invading Iraq was a catastrophic decision with disastrous consequences. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it impossible to impose democracy on the region. The war has been a failure from the start, and withdrawing is likely to be equally challenging. \n\nAlthough I understand the administration may have reasons for wanting to stay, I haven't heard any convincing arguments. If they plan to withdraw gradually, that's acceptable. However, the Iraqi people themselves have repeatedly expressed their desire for us to leave, and I believe we should respect their wishes.  Leaving might be messy, but at least it would demonstrate that we are listening to the people we are trying to help.",
            "I believe gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States, and it's not just against women. The specific field of work can also play a role. While women generally face more obstacles due to societal expectations and the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also be discriminated against. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children might face judgment and disapproval from society that expects them to be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry might be doubted or taken less seriously simply because of their gender, as the field is often associated with femininity. These examples illustrate how societal norms and stereotypes can lead to discrimination based on gender, even in different industries. Although progress has been made, change is slow. The increasing presence of women in leadership positions and the growing acceptance of stay-at-home fathers are positive signs, but more work is needed to overcome deeply ingrained societal biases.",
            "The speaker explains the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They argue that decriminalization, which treats possession as a minor offense like a traffic ticket, reduces the harsh consequences associated with criminal charges. While future ramifications like job interview issues may still exist, decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. The speaker believes this frees up funds that could be used for more beneficial public services. They acknowledge that some communities oppose decriminalization due to moral reasons. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a positive step that allows for greater financial flexibility. The speaker also discusses the potential downsides of full legalization, such as increased accessibility and potential for public consumption, which they believe could be awkward and socially unacceptable. Finally, they acknowledge that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects, and individual reactions to these substances vary greatly.",
            "I believe Catholicism has both positive and negative aspects. While tradition is important, the Church can be inflexible and resistant to change. Many Catholics feel obligated to attend church weekly and adhere strictly to doctrines.  This strictness can lead to judgment towards those who don't perfectly follow the rules, including those from different religions.\n\nFor example, my parents faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church often emphasizes certain actions but its practices contradict these teachings, seeming outdated.\n\nWhile allowing priests to marry might seem appealing, I doubt it would prevent child abuse.  Abuse stems from a fundamental issue and is not directly linked to a priest's marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue, so I can't say definitively whether either side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most challenging topics we face because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage. \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense to anyone.  I think civil unions might be a better approach.  \n\nInstead of the government defining marriage, especially considering its religious significance, perhaps it should be viewed like baptism, where the government doesn't intervene in religious matters.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, it doesn't matter what kind of ceremony they had. They are united, and the government shouldn't differentiate based on religious beliefs.\n\nIf all states agree on a solution, they should push for federal law.  \n\nI strongly oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution for something this personal and  important to certain groups, but not fundamentally affecting the nation, seems excessive.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I feel strongly that this issue should be decided at the state level rather than by the federal government.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings; Democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while Republican states may oppose it.  Individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by that state's government.\n\nI believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalizing same-sex marriage at the state level allows for individual states to make decisions that reflect the values of their residents. \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't think he should dictate the laws of every state. It's more appropriate for decisions like this to be made at a local level, where citizens are directly affected.  The issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is president, so it's best to leave it to the states to determine what's best for their communities.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials were justified in viewing a student's profile. They argue that anything posted online is accessible to anyone, including school officials, regardless of whether they are accessing it through a school device. While acknowledging that searching for student misconduct solely on social media is an invasion of privacy, the speaker feels that if there are legitimate concerns about student safety or potential harm, school officials' actions are justifiable. \n\nThe speaker uses the example of school security drills and the need to prevent incidents like Columbine to illustrate the school's responsibility to ensure student safety. They emphasize that, ultimately, the school's goal is to create a safe environment for all students, and viewing a student's online activity can be a tool to achieve that goal.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 had a profound personal impact on me.  I felt strongly about retaliating against those responsible for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went into the conflict unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired.\n\nI've become disillusioned with the situation. I feel the internal conflicts within Iraq prevent them from addressing external threats, making our presence ineffective.  I've become detached from the situation, even questioning the humanity of the people involved due to their constant fighting.\n\nOur understanding of war differs greatly from theirs. Their approach is more brutal and less about national betterment, which makes it difficult to achieve our objectives.  I believe we should leave Iraq and allow them to resolve their own issues. \n\nThe initial decision to go to war was likely fueled by public sentiment and a desire for revenge, rather than rational analysis. While I understand the pressure on President Bush to act after 9/11, I believe a more thoughtful and comprehensive plan was needed. The lack of a clear objective and unity of purpose contributed to our difficulties.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing the deeply ingrained cultural and political dynamics of Iraq.  I fear that any progress we make will be short-lived, and our continued presence is ultimately detrimental to both ourselves and Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views to avoid losing members. They cite issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control as examples of where the Church's stance feels outdated and alienates people.  The speaker feels that if the Church were more accepting of diverse viewpoints, it wouldn't face this decline in followers. \n\nThey also suggest that allowing female priests and married priests could help bridge the gap with modern society. While acknowledging that these changes might not have prevented past scandals, the speaker believes they could contribute to a more inclusive and relevant Church.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but deny that right to same-sex couples. It feels like a personal matter, and the federal government shouldn't intervene in people's lives regarding their relationships.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there are no compelling reasons against it. While some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, this is unfounded. Gay relationships are diverse and should not be conflated with heterosexual relationships.  \n\nDenying marriage equality to LGBTQ+ individuals deprives them of crucial civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a sick partner might be barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital due to legal limitations. \n\nScientific research shows that same-sex couples experience similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. Ultimately, marriage is a legal contract, not a religious sacrament, and the government should not interfere with personal choices in this regard.\n\nConcerns about adoption and societal impacts are often based on unfounded fears. Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The real issue often lies in societal prejudice and discrimination, as evidenced by instances of bullying and exclusion faced by children of LGBTQ+ parents. \n\nThe government should ensure equal rights for all its citizens, including LGBTQ+ individuals, by legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  It's hypocritical to oppose same-sex marriage while simultaneously upholding the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, demonstrating a selective application of religious values in public policy.\n\nFinally, the notion that homosexuality stems from psychological damage is scientifically inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and it's crucial to rely on evidence-based information rather than prejudices and unfounded beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't automatically mean it's harmful. I think making marijuana accessible for medicinal purposes is a good idea because its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply due to its legal status.  \n\nMany controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in pharmacies for their medicinal value.  It's unfair to deny marijuana the same consideration just because of societal stigma. We should embrace its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that alcohol can also be harmful if abused, I believe marijuana, if used responsibly, has less potential for abuse.  I think a gradual integration of marijuana into society, starting with legalizing it for medical purposes, would be beneficial. Removing the stigma surrounding marijuana is crucial to encouraging responsible use.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. However, it's not as dangerous as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting a shift towards casual attire and shorter services. They observe a change in the atmosphere, with more casual dress and families arriving late to mass. While they acknowledge the church's stance on priestly celibacy, they don't believe allowing priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia, suggesting that it stems from individual predispositions rather than the lack of marriage. They argue that individuals with this inclination may still develop it even if married. The speaker also believes that genetics plays a role in pedophilia, making it difficult to conceal. They criticize the church for covering up instances of abuse but acknowledge that not all cases were necessarily known.",
            "The speaker expresses deep disapproval of the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses used by the Bush administration to justify invading Iraq. They criticize the administration for misleading the American people about the connection between Iraq, Osama Bin Laden, and 9/11, as well as their claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and possibly even an impeachable offense. \n\nThey also believe the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution and had a pre-existing intention to go to war.  The speaker suggests that the younger Bush's personal feelings towards Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and a desire to secure energy resources may have influenced the decision to invade. \n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the U.S. withdraws immediately, the speaker remains critical of the current political situation in Iraq. They express concerns about the UN and U.S. proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations taking control, fearing it will further complicate matters by undermining Iraqi sovereignty.  The speaker highlights the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi Parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the continued influence of radical factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, all of which contribute to the instability and uncertainty in the country.",
            "The speaker expresses a conflicted view on the War in Iraq. They believe it was initially motivated by a desire for revenge for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose, seeing it as an attempt to impose American democracy and access oil. They acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracy in Iraq and the potential negative consequences of both withdrawing or remaining. They also express concerns about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. While acknowledging the personal sacrifices of soldiers and the suffering of Iraqi civilians, they ultimately believe that the war is counterproductive and will likely lead to further instability and resentment towards the United States.",
            "The speaker firmly believes that the government should not be involved in legalizing or criminalizing certain practices, particularly those related to religion. They argue that the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the Constitution, prevents the government from imposing its will on religious beliefs. They feel that attempts to create a law or amendment regarding this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious perspective over others.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that religious decisions should be left to individual churches and denominations, as different faiths hold diverse views. They see the proposed amendment as a personal crusade driven by the initiator's own Catholic beliefs, rather than a legitimate societal concern. They believe it would be an unusual amendment, unlike others, which typically aim to restrict government power rather than individual freedoms. The speaker concludes that such an amendment is unnecessary and potentially beneficial to society.",
            "The speaker believes the US government was dishonest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They oppose preemptive war and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the US government for not anticipating the chaos and insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, arguing that the US attempted to deceive the public about the ease of establishing democracy in Iraq. \n\nThey acknowledge the difficulty of withdrawing from Iraq after years of involvement, but also question the high cost in American lives for a \"free democratic Iraq.\" The speaker further criticizes the US government's inconsistencies in dealing with other countries, like North Korea, which have weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that oil and resource control are more significant factors in US foreign policy. \n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses a hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has biological roots rather than being solely sociological. Denying individuals rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane.  \n\nI believe politics and government should stay out of this issue. Marriage is a personal and family matter, not a governmental one. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live and function like any other family, even though they can't marry. \n\nI think President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation are misguided. \n\nScientific evidence suggests that sexual orientation may have a biological basis, possibly even a chemical component in the brain, rather than being influenced by upbringing or environmental factors. \n\nOne of the key issues is the public scrutiny gay couples face when seeking to marry. While heterosexual couples can easily get married privately, gay couples' unions often become public events. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public and political one.",
            "Posting information online makes it publicly accessible.  It can influence people's perceptions of you, and serious topics like threats or violence should be avoided. While it's important to remember that not everything online is meant to be taken seriously, schools have a responsibility to address potential threats.  \n\nA person's online activity can be alarming to others, even if it was intended as a joke.  Schools may be alerted to potentially dangerous content by students or concerned individuals. Since anything shared online is publicly accessible, there's a limited expectation of privacy.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of what you post online, as it can have real-world consequences. Schools should not actively monitor students' online activity, but they are obligated to take seriously any information brought to their attention that suggests a potential threat.",
            "The speaker believes the war has become too prolonged and has strayed from its original purpose. They initially supported the war as a means to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, they now feel that the goal has been obscured, and the war is perhaps driven by a desire to assert global dominance.  The speaker also questions the initial motivations, suggesting potential personal conflicts involving former President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein may have influenced the decision to go to war.\n\nWhile the speaker acknowledges the initial purpose of bringing democracy to the country, they argue that the war has lost its justification. They believe the initial goal was achieved in the early stages, and the prolonged conflict feels unnecessary.  The speaker emphasizes that the war has become financially draining, diverting resources from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. They feel the money spent on the war could be better allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of someone finding potentially harmful information on social media profiles and preventing a tragedy. They acknowledge that information shared online is generally public, but question the extent to which someone should be able to monitor profiles for potential threats. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of discrimination and the impracticality of having someone constantly watch profiles. They also share personal experiences with online privacy concerns, mentioning instances where strangers knew personal details about them from their social media presence. The speaker concludes by mentioning a situation where a high school banned students from using Myspace, questioning the school's authority to restrict students' access to the platform.",
            "I feel hesitant to discuss the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it. However, it's impossible to ignore the overwhelming global consensus that the war was a mistake, including within Iraq itself and even among U.S. troops currently stationed there.  \n\nWhile I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, I believe invading Iraq was a catastrophic decision with disastrous consequences. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it impossible to impose democracy on the region. The war has been a failure from the start, and withdrawing is likely to be equally challenging. \n\nAlthough I understand the administration may have reasons for wanting to stay, I haven't heard any convincing arguments. If they plan to withdraw gradually, that's acceptable. However, the Iraqi people themselves have repeatedly expressed their desire for us to leave, and I believe we should respect their wishes.  Leaving might be messy, but at least it would demonstrate that we are listening to the people we are trying to help.",
            "I believe gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States, and it's not just against women. The specific field of work can also play a role. While women generally face more obstacles due to societal expectations and the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also be discriminated against. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children might face judgment and disapproval from society that expects them to be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry might be doubted or taken less seriously simply because of their gender, as the field is often associated with femininity. These examples illustrate how societal norms and stereotypes can lead to discrimination based on gender, even in different industries. Although progress has been made, change is slow. The increasing presence of women in leadership positions and the growing acceptance of stay-at-home fathers are positive signs, but more work is needed to overcome deeply ingrained societal biases.",
            "The speaker explains the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They argue that decriminalization, which treats possession as a minor offense like a traffic ticket, reduces the harsh consequences associated with criminal charges. While future ramifications like job interview issues may still exist, decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. The speaker believes this frees up funds that could be used for more beneficial public services. They acknowledge that some communities oppose decriminalization due to moral reasons. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a positive step that allows for greater financial flexibility. The speaker also discusses the potential downsides of full legalization, such as increased accessibility and potential for public consumption, which they believe could be awkward and socially unacceptable. Finally, they acknowledge that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects, and individual reactions to these substances vary greatly.",
            "I believe Catholicism has both positive and negative aspects. While tradition is important, the Church can be inflexible and resistant to change. Many Catholics feel obligated to attend church weekly and adhere strictly to doctrines.  This strictness can lead to judgment towards those who don't perfectly follow the rules, including those from different religions.\n\nFor example, my parents faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church often emphasizes certain actions but its practices contradict these teachings, seeming outdated.\n\nWhile allowing priests to marry might seem appealing, I doubt it would prevent child abuse.  Abuse stems from a fundamental issue and is not directly linked to a priest's marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue, so I can't say definitively whether either side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most challenging topics we face because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage. \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense to anyone.  I think civil unions might be a better approach.  \n\nInstead of the government defining marriage, especially considering its religious significance, perhaps it should be viewed like baptism, where the government doesn't intervene in religious matters.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, it doesn't matter what kind of ceremony they had. They are united, and the government shouldn't differentiate based on religious beliefs.\n\nIf all states agree on a solution, they should push for federal law.  \n\nI strongly oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution for something this personal and  important to certain groups, but not fundamentally affecting the nation, seems excessive.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I feel strongly that this issue should be decided at the state level rather than by the federal government.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings; Democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while Republican states may oppose it.  Individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by that state's government.\n\nI believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalizing same-sex marriage at the state level allows for individual states to make decisions that reflect the values of their residents. \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't think he should dictate the laws of every state. It's more appropriate for decisions like this to be made at a local level, where citizens are directly affected.  The issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is president, so it's best to leave it to the states to determine what's best for their communities.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials were justified in viewing a student's profile. They argue that anything posted online is accessible to anyone, including school officials, regardless of whether they are accessing it through a school device. While acknowledging that searching for student misconduct solely on social media is an invasion of privacy, the speaker feels that if there are legitimate concerns about student safety or potential harm, school officials' actions are justifiable. \n\nThe speaker uses the example of school security drills and the need to prevent incidents like Columbine to illustrate the school's responsibility to ensure student safety. They emphasize that, ultimately, the school's goal is to create a safe environment for all students, and viewing a student's online activity can be a tool to achieve that goal.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 had a profound personal impact on me.  I felt strongly about retaliating against those responsible for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went into the conflict unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired.\n\nI've become disillusioned with the situation. I feel the internal conflicts within Iraq prevent them from addressing external threats, making our presence ineffective.  I've become detached from the situation, even questioning the humanity of the people involved due to their constant fighting.\n\nOur understanding of war differs greatly from theirs. Their approach is more brutal and less about national betterment, which makes it difficult to achieve our objectives.  I believe we should leave Iraq and allow them to resolve their own issues. \n\nThe initial decision to go to war was likely fueled by public sentiment and a desire for revenge, rather than rational analysis. While I understand the pressure on President Bush to act after 9/11, I believe a more thoughtful and comprehensive plan was needed. The lack of a clear objective and unity of purpose contributed to our difficulties.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing the deeply ingrained cultural and political dynamics of Iraq.  I fear that any progress we make will be short-lived, and our continued presence is ultimately detrimental to both ourselves and Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views to avoid losing members. They cite issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control as examples of where the Church's stance feels outdated and alienates people.  The speaker feels that if the Church were more accepting of diverse viewpoints, it wouldn't face this decline in followers. \n\nThey also suggest that allowing female priests and married priests could help bridge the gap with modern society. While acknowledging that these changes might not have prevented past scandals, the speaker believes they could contribute to a more inclusive and relevant Church.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but deny that right to same-sex couples. It feels like a personal matter, and the federal government shouldn't intervene in people's lives regarding their relationships.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there are no compelling reasons against it. While some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, this is unfounded. Gay relationships are diverse and should not be conflated with heterosexual relationships.  \n\nDenying marriage equality to LGBTQ+ individuals deprives them of crucial civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a sick partner might be barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital due to legal limitations. \n\nScientific research shows that same-sex couples experience similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. Ultimately, marriage is a legal contract, not a religious sacrament, and the government should not interfere with personal choices in this regard.\n\nConcerns about adoption and societal impacts are often based on unfounded fears. Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The real issue often lies in societal prejudice and discrimination, as evidenced by instances of bullying and exclusion faced by children of LGBTQ+ parents. \n\nThe government should ensure equal rights for all its citizens, including LGBTQ+ individuals, by legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  It's hypocritical to oppose same-sex marriage while simultaneously upholding the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, demonstrating a selective application of religious values in public policy.\n\nFinally, the notion that homosexuality stems from psychological damage is scientifically inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and it's crucial to rely on evidence-based information rather than prejudices and unfounded beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't automatically mean it's harmful. I think making marijuana accessible for medicinal purposes is a good idea because its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply due to its legal status.  \n\nMany controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in pharmacies for their medicinal value.  It's unfair to deny marijuana the same consideration just because of societal stigma. We should embrace its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that alcohol can also be harmful if abused, I believe marijuana, if used responsibly, has less potential for abuse.  I think a gradual integration of marijuana into society, starting with legalizing it for medical purposes, would be beneficial. Removing the stigma surrounding marijuana is crucial to encouraging responsible use.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. However, it's not as dangerous as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting a shift towards casual attire and shorter services. They observe a change in the atmosphere, with more casual dress and families arriving late to mass. While they acknowledge the church's stance on priestly celibacy, they don't believe allowing priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia, suggesting that it stems from individual predispositions rather than the lack of marriage. They argue that individuals with this inclination may still develop it even if married. The speaker also believes that genetics plays a role in pedophilia, making it difficult to conceal. They criticize the church for covering up instances of abuse but acknowledge that not all cases were necessarily known.",
            "The speaker expresses deep disapproval of the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses used by the Bush administration to justify invading Iraq. They criticize the administration for misleading the American people about the connection between Iraq, Osama Bin Laden, and 9/11, as well as their claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and possibly even an impeachable offense. \n\nThey also believe the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution and had a pre-existing intention to go to war.  The speaker suggests that the younger Bush's personal feelings towards Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and a desire to secure energy resources may have influenced the decision to invade. \n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the U.S. withdraws immediately, the speaker remains critical of the current political situation in Iraq. They express concerns about the UN and U.S. proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations taking control, fearing it will further complicate matters by undermining Iraqi sovereignty.  The speaker highlights the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi Parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the continued influence of radical factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, all of which contribute to the instability and uncertainty in the country.",
            "The speaker expresses a conflicted view on the War in Iraq. They believe it was initially motivated by a desire for revenge for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose, seeing it as an attempt to impose American democracy and access oil. They acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracy in Iraq and the potential negative consequences of both withdrawing or remaining. They also express concerns about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. While acknowledging the personal sacrifices of soldiers and the suffering of Iraqi civilians, they ultimately believe that the war is counterproductive and will likely lead to further instability and resentment towards the United States.",
            "The speaker firmly believes that the government should not be involved in legalizing or criminalizing certain practices, particularly those related to religion. They argue that the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the Constitution, prevents the government from imposing its will on religious beliefs. They feel that attempts to create a law or amendment regarding this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious perspective over others.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that religious decisions should be left to individual churches and denominations, as different faiths hold diverse views. They see the proposed amendment as a personal crusade driven by the initiator's own Catholic beliefs, rather than a legitimate societal concern. They believe it would be an unusual amendment, unlike others, which typically aim to restrict government power rather than individual freedoms. The speaker concludes that such an amendment is unnecessary and potentially beneficial to society.",
            "The speaker believes the US government was dishonest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They oppose preemptive war and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the US government for not anticipating the chaos and insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, arguing that the US attempted to deceive the public about the ease of establishing democracy in Iraq. \n\nThey acknowledge the difficulty of withdrawing from Iraq after years of involvement, but also question the high cost in American lives for a \"free democratic Iraq.\" The speaker further criticizes the US government's inconsistencies in dealing with other countries, like North Korea, which have weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that oil and resource control are more significant factors in US foreign policy. \n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses a hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has biological roots rather than being solely sociological. Denying individuals rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane.  \n\nI believe politics and government should stay out of this issue. Marriage is a personal and family matter, not a governmental one. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live and function like any other family, even though they can't marry. \n\nI think President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation are misguided. \n\nScientific evidence suggests that sexual orientation may have a biological basis, possibly even a chemical component in the brain, rather than being influenced by upbringing or environmental factors. \n\nOne of the key issues is the public scrutiny gay couples face when seeking to marry. While heterosexual couples can easily get married privately, gay couples' unions often become public events. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public and political one.",
            "Posting information online makes it publicly accessible.  It can influence people's perceptions of you, and serious topics like threats or violence should be avoided. While it's important to remember that not everything online is meant to be taken seriously, schools have a responsibility to address potential threats.  \n\nA person's online activity can be alarming to others, even if it was intended as a joke.  Schools may be alerted to potentially dangerous content by students or concerned individuals. Since anything shared online is publicly accessible, there's a limited expectation of privacy.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of what you post online, as it can have real-world consequences. Schools should not actively monitor students' online activity, but they are obligated to take seriously any information brought to their attention that suggests a potential threat.",
            "The speaker believes the war has become too prolonged and has strayed from its original purpose. They initially supported the war as a means to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, they now feel that the goal has been obscured, and the war is perhaps driven by a desire to assert global dominance.  The speaker also questions the initial motivations, suggesting potential personal conflicts involving former President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein may have influenced the decision to go to war.\n\nWhile the speaker acknowledges the initial purpose of bringing democracy to the country, they argue that the war has lost its justification. They believe the initial goal was achieved in the early stages, and the prolonged conflict feels unnecessary.  The speaker emphasizes that the war has become financially draining, diverting resources from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. They feel the money spent on the war could be better allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of someone finding potentially harmful information on social media profiles and preventing a tragedy. They acknowledge that information shared online is generally public, but question the extent to which someone should be able to monitor profiles for potential threats. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of discrimination and the impracticality of having someone constantly watch profiles. They also share personal experiences with online privacy concerns, mentioning instances where strangers knew personal details about them from their social media presence. The speaker concludes by mentioning a situation where a high school banned students from using Myspace, questioning the school's authority to restrict students' access to the platform.",
            "I feel hesitant to discuss the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it. However, it's impossible to ignore the overwhelming global consensus that the war was a mistake, including within Iraq itself and even among U.S. troops currently stationed there.  \n\nWhile I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, I believe invading Iraq was a catastrophic decision with disastrous consequences. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it impossible to impose democracy on the region. The war has been a failure from the start, and withdrawing is likely to be equally challenging. \n\nAlthough I understand the administration may have reasons for wanting to stay, I haven't heard any convincing arguments. If they plan to withdraw gradually, that's acceptable. However, the Iraqi people themselves have repeatedly expressed their desire for us to leave, and I believe we should respect their wishes.  Leaving might be messy, but at least it would demonstrate that we are listening to the people we are trying to help.",
            "I believe gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States, and it's not just against women. The specific field of work can also play a role. While women generally face more obstacles due to societal expectations and the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also be discriminated against. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children might face judgment and disapproval from society that expects them to be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry might be doubted or taken less seriously simply because of their gender, as the field is often associated with femininity. These examples illustrate how societal norms and stereotypes can lead to discrimination based on gender, even in different industries. Although progress has been made, change is slow. The increasing presence of women in leadership positions and the growing acceptance of stay-at-home fathers are positive signs, but more work is needed to overcome deeply ingrained societal biases.",
            "The speaker explains the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They argue that decriminalization, which treats possession as a minor offense like a traffic ticket, reduces the harsh consequences associated with criminal charges. While future ramifications like job interview issues may still exist, decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. The speaker believes this frees up funds that could be used for more beneficial public services. They acknowledge that some communities oppose decriminalization due to moral reasons. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a positive step that allows for greater financial flexibility. The speaker also discusses the potential downsides of full legalization, such as increased accessibility and potential for public consumption, which they believe could be awkward and socially unacceptable. Finally, they acknowledge that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects, and individual reactions to these substances vary greatly.",
            "I believe Catholicism has both positive and negative aspects. While tradition is important, the Church can be inflexible and resistant to change. Many Catholics feel obligated to attend church weekly and adhere strictly to doctrines.  This strictness can lead to judgment towards those who don't perfectly follow the rules, including those from different religions.\n\nFor example, my parents faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church often emphasizes certain actions but its practices contradict these teachings, seeming outdated.\n\nWhile allowing priests to marry might seem appealing, I doubt it would prevent child abuse.  Abuse stems from a fundamental issue and is not directly linked to a priest's marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue, so I can't say definitively whether either side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most challenging topics we face because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage. \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense to anyone.  I think civil unions might be a better approach.  \n\nInstead of the government defining marriage, especially considering its religious significance, perhaps it should be viewed like baptism, where the government doesn't intervene in religious matters.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, it doesn't matter what kind of ceremony they had. They are united, and the government shouldn't differentiate based on religious beliefs.\n\nIf all states agree on a solution, they should push for federal law.  \n\nI strongly oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution for something this personal and  important to certain groups, but not fundamentally affecting the nation, seems excessive.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I feel strongly that this issue should be decided at the state level rather than by the federal government.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings; Democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while Republican states may oppose it.  Individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by that state's government.\n\nI believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalizing same-sex marriage at the state level allows for individual states to make decisions that reflect the values of their residents. \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't think he should dictate the laws of every state. It's more appropriate for decisions like this to be made at a local level, where citizens are directly affected.  The issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is president, so it's best to leave it to the states to determine what's best for their communities.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials were justified in viewing a student's profile. They argue that anything posted online is accessible to anyone, including school officials, regardless of whether they are accessing it through a school device. While acknowledging that searching for student misconduct solely on social media is an invasion of privacy, the speaker feels that if there are legitimate concerns about student safety or potential harm, school officials' actions are justifiable. \n\nThe speaker uses the example of school security drills and the need to prevent incidents like Columbine to illustrate the school's responsibility to ensure student safety. They emphasize that, ultimately, the school's goal is to create a safe environment for all students, and viewing a student's online activity can be a tool to achieve that goal.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 had a profound personal impact on me.  I felt strongly about retaliating against those responsible for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went into the conflict unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired.\n\nI've become disillusioned with the situation. I feel the internal conflicts within Iraq prevent them from addressing external threats, making our presence ineffective.  I've become detached from the situation, even questioning the humanity of the people involved due to their constant fighting.\n\nOur understanding of war differs greatly from theirs. Their approach is more brutal and less about national betterment, which makes it difficult to achieve our objectives.  I believe we should leave Iraq and allow them to resolve their own issues. \n\nThe initial decision to go to war was likely fueled by public sentiment and a desire for revenge, rather than rational analysis. While I understand the pressure on President Bush to act after 9/11, I believe a more thoughtful and comprehensive plan was needed. The lack of a clear objective and unity of purpose contributed to our difficulties.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing the deeply ingrained cultural and political dynamics of Iraq.  I fear that any progress we make will be short-lived, and our continued presence is ultimately detrimental to both ourselves and Iraq."
