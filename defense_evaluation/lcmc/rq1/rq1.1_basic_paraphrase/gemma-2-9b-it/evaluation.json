            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The speaker feels that if the Church were more accepting of diverse viewpoints, it wouldn't face this decline in followers. \n\nThey also suggest that allowing female priests and married priests could help bridge the gap with modern society. While acknowledging that these changes might not have prevented past scandals, the speaker believes they could contribute to a more inclusive and relevant Church.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but deny that right to same-sex couples. It feels like a personal matter, and the federal government shouldn't intervene in people's lives regarding their relationships.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there are no compelling reasons against it. While some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, this is unfounded. Gay relationships are diverse and should not be conflated with heterosexual relationships.  \n\nDenying marriage equality to LGBTQ+ individuals deprives them of crucial civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a sick partner might be barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital due to legal limitations. \n\nScientific research shows that same-sex couples experience similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. Ultimately, marriage is a legal contract, not a religious sacrament, and the government should not interfere with personal choices in this regard.\n\nConcerns about adoption and societal impacts are often based on unfounded fears. Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The real issue often lies in societal prejudice and discrimination, as evidenced by instances of bullying and exclusion faced by children of LGBTQ+ parents. \n\nThe government should ensure equal rights for all its citizens, including LGBTQ+ individuals, by legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  It's hypocritical to oppose same-sex marriage while simultaneously upholding the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, demonstrating a selective application of religious values in public policy.\n\nFinally, the notion that homosexuality stems from psychological damage is scientifically inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and it's crucial to rely on evidence-based information rather than prejudices and unfounded beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't automatically mean it's harmful. I think making marijuana accessible for medicinal purposes is a good idea because its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply due to its legal status.  \n\nMany controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in pharmacies for their medicinal value.  It's unfair to deny marijuana the same consideration just because of societal stigma. We should embrace its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that alcohol can also be harmful if abused, I believe marijuana, if used responsibly, has less potential for abuse.  I think a gradual integration of marijuana into society, starting with legalizing it for medical purposes, would be beneficial. Removing the stigma surrounding marijuana is crucial to encouraging responsible use.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. However, it's not as dangerous as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal reasons.",

They observe a change in the atmosphere, with more casual dress and families arriving late to mass. While they acknowledge the church's stance on priestly celibacy, they don't believe allowing priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia, suggesting that it stems from individual predispositions rather than the lack of marriage. They argue that individuals with this inclination may still develop it even if married. The speaker also believes that genetics plays a role in pedophilia, making it difficult to conceal. They criticize the church for covering up instances of abuse but acknowledge that not all cases were necessarily known.",
            "The speaker expresses deep disapproval of the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses used by the Bush administration to justify invading Iraq. They criticize the administration for misleading the American people about the connection between Iraq, Osama Bin Laden, and 9/11, as well as their claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and possibly even an impeachable offense. \n\nThey also believe the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution and had a pre-existing intention to go to war.  The speaker suggests that the younger Bush's personal feelings towards Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and a desire to secure energy resources may have influenced the decision to invade. \n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the U.S. withdraws immediately, the speaker remains critical of the current political situation in Iraq. They express concerns about the UN and U.S. proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations taking control, fearing it will further complicate matters by undermining Iraqi sovereignty.  The speaker highlights the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi Parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the continued influence of radical factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, all of which contribute to the instability and uncertainty in the country.",
            "The speaker expresses a conflicted view on the War in Iraq. They believe it was initially motivated by a desire for revenge for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose, seeing it as an attempt to impose American democracy and access oil. They acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracy in Iraq and the potential negative consequences of both withdrawing or remaining. They also express concerns about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. While acknowledging the personal sacrifices of soldiers and the suffering of Iraqi civilians, they ultimately believe that the war is counterproductive and will likely lead to further instability and resentment towards the United States.",
            "The speaker firmly believes that the government should not be involved in legalizing or criminalizing certain practices, particularly those related to religion. They argue that the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the Constitution, prevents the government from imposing its will on religious beliefs. They feel that attempts to create a law or amendment regarding this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious perspective over others.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that religious decisions should be left to individual churches and denominations, as different faiths hold diverse views. They see the proposed amendment as a personal crusade driven by the initiator's own Catholic beliefs, rather than a legitimate societal concern. They believe it would be an unusual amendment, unlike others, which typically aim to restrict government power rather than individual freedoms. The speaker concludes that such an amendment is unnecessary and potentially beneficial to society.",
            "The speaker believes the US government was dishonest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They oppose preemptive war and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the US government for not anticipating the chaos and insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, arguing that the US attempted to deceive the public about the ease of establishing democracy in Iraq. \n\nThey acknowledge the difficulty of withdrawing from Iraq after years of involvement, but also question the high cost in American lives for a \"free democratic Iraq.\" The speaker further criticizes the US government's inconsistencies in dealing with other countries, like North Korea, which have weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that oil and resource control are more significant factors in US foreign policy. \n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses a hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has biological roots rather than being solely sociological. Denying individuals rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane.  \n\nI believe politics and government should stay out of this issue. Marriage is a personal and family matter, not a governmental one. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live and function like any other family, even though they can't marry. \n\nI think President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation are misguided. \n\nScientific evidence suggests that sexual orientation may have a biological basis, possibly even a chemical component in the brain, rather than being influenced by upbringing or environmental factors. \n\nOne of the key issues is the public scrutiny gay couples face when seeking to marry. While heterosexual couples can easily get married privately, gay couples' unions often become public events. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public and political one.",

Schools may be alerted to potentially dangerous content by students or concerned individuals. Since anything shared online is publicly accessible, there's a limited expectation of privacy.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of what you post online, as it can have real-world consequences. Schools should not actively monitor students' online activity, but they are obligated to take seriously any information brought to their attention that suggests a potential threat.",
            "The speaker believes the war has become too prolonged and has strayed from its original purpose. They initially supported the war as a means to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, they now feel that the goal has been obscured, and the war is perhaps driven by a desire to assert global dominance.  The speaker also questions the initial motivations, suggesting potential personal conflicts involving former President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein may have influenced the decision to go to war.\n\nWhile the speaker acknowledges the initial purpose of bringing democracy to the country, they argue that the war has lost its justification. They believe the initial goal was achieved in the early stages, and the prolonged conflict feels unnecessary.  The speaker emphasizes that the war has become financially draining, diverting resources from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. They feel the money spent on the war could be better allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns.",

They acknowledge that information shared online is generally public, but question the extent to which someone should be able to monitor profiles for potential threats. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of discrimination and the impracticality of having someone constantly watch profiles. They also share personal experiences with online privacy concerns, mentioning instances where strangers knew personal details about them from their social media presence. The speaker concludes by mentioning a situation where a high school banned students from using Myspace, questioning the school's authority to restrict students' access to the platform.",
            "I feel hesitant to discuss the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it. However, it's impossible to ignore the overwhelming global consensus that the war was a mistake, including within Iraq itself and even among U.S. troops currently stationed there.  \n\nWhile I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, I believe invading Iraq was a catastrophic decision with disastrous consequences. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it impossible to impose democracy on the region. The war has been a failure from the start, and withdrawing is likely to be equally challenging. \n\nAlthough I understand the administration may have reasons for wanting to stay, I haven't heard any convincing arguments. If they plan to withdraw gradually, that's acceptable. However, the Iraqi people themselves have repeatedly expressed their desire for us to leave, and I believe we should respect their wishes.  Leaving might be messy, but at least it would demonstrate that we are listening to the people we are trying to help.",
            "I believe gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States, and it's not just against women. The specific field of work can also play a role. While women generally face more obstacles due to societal expectations and the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also be discriminated against. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children might face judgment and disapproval from society that expects them to be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry might be doubted or taken less seriously simply because of their gender, as the field is often associated with femininity. These examples illustrate how societal norms and stereotypes can lead to discrimination based on gender, even in different industries. Although progress has been made, change is slow. The increasing presence of women in leadership positions and the growing acceptance of stay-at-home fathers are positive signs, but more work is needed to overcome deeply ingrained societal biases.",
            "The speaker explains the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They argue that decriminalization, which treats possession as a minor offense like a traffic ticket, reduces the harsh consequences associated with criminal charges. While future ramifications like job interview issues may still exist, decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. The speaker believes this frees up funds that could be used for more beneficial public services. They acknowledge that some communities oppose decriminalization due to moral reasons. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a positive step that allows for greater financial flexibility. The speaker also discusses the potential downsides of full legalization, such as increased accessibility and potential for public consumption, which they believe could be awkward and socially unacceptable. Finally, they acknowledge that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects, and individual reactions to these substances vary greatly.",
            "I believe Catholicism has both positive and negative aspects. While tradition is important, the Church can be inflexible and resistant to change. Many Catholics feel obligated to attend church weekly and adhere strictly to doctrines.  This strictness can lead to judgment towards those who don't perfectly follow the rules, including those from different religions.\n\nFor example, my parents faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church often emphasizes certain actions but its practices contradict these teachings, seeming outdated.\n\nWhile allowing priests to marry might seem appealing, I doubt it would prevent child abuse.  Abuse stems from a fundamental issue and is not directly linked to a priest's marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue, so I can't say definitively whether either side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most challenging topics we face because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage. \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense to anyone.  I think civil unions might be a better approach.  \n\nInstead of the government defining marriage, especially considering its religious significance, perhaps it should be viewed like baptism, where the government doesn't intervene in religious matters.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, it doesn't matter what kind of ceremony they had. They are united, and the government shouldn't differentiate based on religious beliefs.\n\nIf all states agree on a solution, they should push for federal law.  \n\nI strongly oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution for something this personal and  important to certain groups, but not fundamentally affecting the nation, seems excessive.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I feel strongly that this issue should be decided at the state level rather than by the federal government.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings; Democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while Republican states may oppose it.  Individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by that state's government.\n\nI believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalizing same-sex marriage at the state level allows for individual states to make decisions that reflect the values of their residents. \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't think he should dictate the laws of every state. It's more appropriate for decisions like this to be made at a local level, where citizens are directly affected.  The issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is president, so it's best to leave it to the states to determine what's best for their communities.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials were justified in viewing a student's profile. They argue that anything posted online is accessible to anyone, including school officials, regardless of whether they are accessing it through a school device. While acknowledging that searching for student misconduct solely on social media is an invasion of privacy, the speaker feels that if there are legitimate concerns about student safety or potential harm, school officials' actions are justifiable. \n\nThe speaker uses the example of school security drills and the need to prevent incidents like Columbine to illustrate the school's responsibility to ensure student safety. They emphasize that, ultimately, the school's goal is to create a safe environment for all students, and viewing a student's online activity can be a tool to achieve that goal.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 had a profound personal impact on me.  I felt strongly about retaliating against those responsible for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went into the conflict unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired.\n\nI've become disillusioned with the situation. I feel the internal conflicts within Iraq prevent them from addressing external threats, making our presence ineffective.  I've become detached from the situation, even questioning the humanity of the people involved due to their constant fighting.\n\nOur understanding of war differs greatly from theirs. Their approach is more brutal and less about national betterment, which makes it difficult to achieve our objectives.  I believe we should leave Iraq and allow them to resolve their own issues. \n\nThe initial decision to go to war was likely fueled by public sentiment and a desire for revenge, rather than rational analysis. While I understand the pressure on President Bush to act after 9/11, I believe a more thoughtful and comprehensive plan was needed. The lack of a clear objective and unity of purpose contributed to our difficulties.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing the deeply ingrained cultural and political dynamics of Iraq.  I fear that any progress we make will be short-lived, and our continued presence is ultimately detrimental to both ourselves and Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views to avoid losing members. They cite issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control as examples of where the Church's stance feels outdated and alienates people.  The speaker feels that if the Church were more accepting of diverse viewpoints, it wouldn't face this decline in followers. \n\nThey also suggest that allowing female priests and married priests could help bridge the gap with modern society. While acknowledging that these changes might not have prevented past scandals, the speaker believes they could contribute to a more inclusive and relevant Church.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but deny that right to same-sex couples. It feels like a personal matter, and the federal government shouldn't intervene in people's lives regarding their relationships.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there are no compelling reasons against it. While some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, this is unfounded. Gay relationships are diverse and should not be conflated with heterosexual relationships.  \n\nDenying marriage equality to LGBTQ+ individuals deprives them of crucial civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a sick partner might be barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital due to legal limitations. \n\nScientific research shows that same-sex couples experience similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. Ultimately, marriage is a legal contract, not a religious sacrament, and the government should not interfere with personal choices in this regard.\n\nConcerns about adoption and societal impacts are often based on unfounded fears. Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The real issue often lies in societal prejudice and discrimination, as evidenced by instances of bullying and exclusion faced by children of LGBTQ+ parents. \n\nThe government should ensure equal rights for all its citizens, including LGBTQ+ individuals, by legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  It's hypocritical to oppose same-sex marriage while simultaneously upholding the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, demonstrating a selective application of religious values in public policy.\n\nFinally, the notion that homosexuality stems from psychological damage is scientifically inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and it's crucial to rely on evidence-based information rather than prejudices and unfounded beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't automatically mean it's harmful. I think making marijuana accessible for medicinal purposes is a good idea because its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply due to its legal status.  \n\nMany controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in pharmacies for their medicinal value.  It's unfair to deny marijuana the same consideration just because of societal stigma. We should embrace its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that alcohol can also be harmful if abused, I believe marijuana, if used responsibly, has less potential for abuse.  I think a gradual integration of marijuana into society, starting with legalizing it for medical purposes, would be beneficial. Removing the stigma surrounding marijuana is crucial to encouraging responsible use.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. However, it's not as dangerous as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting a shift towards casual attire and shorter services. They observe a change in the atmosphere, with more casual dress and families arriving late to mass. While they acknowledge the church's stance on priestly celibacy, they don't believe allowing priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia, suggesting that it stems from individual predispositions rather than the lack of marriage. They argue that individuals with this inclination may still develop it even if married. The speaker also believes that genetics plays a role in pedophilia, making it difficult to conceal. They criticize the church for covering up instances of abuse but acknowledge that not all cases were necessarily known.",
            "The speaker expresses deep disapproval of the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses used by the Bush administration to justify invading Iraq. They criticize the administration for misleading the American people about the connection between Iraq, Osama Bin Laden, and 9/11, as well as their claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and possibly even an impeachable offense. \n\nThey also believe the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution and had a pre-existing intention to go to war.  The speaker suggests that the younger Bush's personal feelings towards Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and a desire to secure energy resources may have influenced the decision to invade. \n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the U.S. withdraws immediately, the speaker remains critical of the current political situation in Iraq. They express concerns about the UN and U.S. proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations taking control, fearing it will further complicate matters by undermining Iraqi sovereignty.  The speaker highlights the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi Parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the continued influence of radical factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, all of which contribute to the instability and uncertainty in the country.",
            "The speaker expresses a conflicted view on the War in Iraq. They believe it was initially motivated by a desire for revenge for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose, seeing it as an attempt to impose American democracy and access oil. They acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracy in Iraq and the potential negative consequences of both withdrawing or remaining. They also express concerns about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. While acknowledging the personal sacrifices of soldiers and the suffering of Iraqi civilians, they ultimately believe that the war is counterproductive and will likely lead to further instability and resentment towards the United States.",
            "The speaker firmly believes that the government should not be involved in legalizing or criminalizing certain practices, particularly those related to religion. They argue that the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the Constitution, prevents the government from imposing its will on religious beliefs. They feel that attempts to create a law or amendment regarding this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious perspective over others.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that religious decisions should be left to individual churches and denominations, as different faiths hold diverse views. They see the proposed amendment as a personal crusade driven by the initiator's own Catholic beliefs, rather than a legitimate societal concern. They believe it would be an unusual amendment, unlike others, which typically aim to restrict government power rather than individual freedoms. The speaker concludes that such an amendment is unnecessary and potentially beneficial to society.",
            "The speaker believes the US government was dishonest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They oppose preemptive war and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the US government for not anticipating the chaos and insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, arguing that the US attempted to deceive the public about the ease of establishing democracy in Iraq. \n\nThey acknowledge the difficulty of withdrawing from Iraq after years of involvement, but also question the high cost in American lives for a \"free democratic Iraq.\" The speaker further criticizes the US government's inconsistencies in dealing with other countries, like North Korea, which have weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that oil and resource control are more significant factors in US foreign policy. \n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses a hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has biological roots rather than being solely sociological. Denying individuals rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane.  \n\nI believe politics and government should stay out of this issue. Marriage is a personal and family matter, not a governmental one. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live and function like any other family, even though they can't marry. \n\nI think President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation are misguided. \n\nScientific evidence suggests that sexual orientation may have a biological basis, possibly even a chemical component in the brain, rather than being influenced by upbringing or environmental factors. \n\nOne of the key issues is the public scrutiny gay couples face when seeking to marry. While heterosexual couples can easily get married privately, gay couples' unions often become public events. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public and political one.",
            "Posting information online makes it publicly accessible.  It can influence people's perceptions of you, and serious topics like threats or violence should be avoided. While it's important to remember that not everything online is meant to be taken seriously, schools have a responsibility to address potential threats.  \n\nA person's online activity can be alarming to others, even if it was intended as a joke.  Schools may be alerted to potentially dangerous content by students or concerned individuals. Since anything shared online is publicly accessible, there's a limited expectation of privacy.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of what you post online, as it can have real-world consequences. Schools should not actively monitor students' online activity, but they are obligated to take seriously any information brought to their attention that suggests a potential threat.",
            "The speaker believes the war has become too prolonged and has strayed from its original purpose. They initially supported the war as a means to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, they now feel that the goal has been obscured, and the war is perhaps driven by a desire to assert global dominance.  The speaker also questions the initial motivations, suggesting potential personal conflicts involving former President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein may have influenced the decision to go to war.\n\nWhile the speaker acknowledges the initial purpose of bringing democracy to the country, they argue that the war has lost its justification. They believe the initial goal was achieved in the early stages, and the prolonged conflict feels unnecessary.  The speaker emphasizes that the war has become financially draining, diverting resources from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. They feel the money spent on the war could be better allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of someone finding potentially harmful information on social media profiles and preventing a tragedy. They acknowledge that information shared online is generally public, but question the extent to which someone should be able to monitor profiles for potential threats. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of discrimination and the impracticality of having someone constantly watch profiles. They also share personal experiences with online privacy concerns, mentioning instances where strangers knew personal details about them from their social media presence. The speaker concludes by mentioning a situation where a high school banned students from using Myspace, questioning the school's authority to restrict students' access to the platform.",
            "I feel hesitant to discuss the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it. However, it's impossible to ignore the overwhelming global consensus that the war was a mistake, including within Iraq itself and even among U.S. troops currently stationed there.  \n\nWhile I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, I believe invading Iraq was a catastrophic decision with disastrous consequences. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it impossible to impose democracy on the region. The war has been a failure from the start, and withdrawing is likely to be equally challenging. \n\nAlthough I understand the administration may have reasons for wanting to stay, I haven't heard any convincing arguments. If they plan to withdraw gradually, that's acceptable. However, the Iraqi people themselves have repeatedly expressed their desire for us to leave, and I believe we should respect their wishes.  Leaving might be messy, but at least it would demonstrate that we are listening to the people we are trying to help.",
            "I believe gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States, and it's not just against women. The specific field of work can also play a role. While women generally face more obstacles due to societal expectations and the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also be discriminated against. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children might face judgment and disapproval from society that expects them to be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry might be doubted or taken less seriously simply because of their gender, as the field is often associated with femininity. These examples illustrate how societal norms and stereotypes can lead to discrimination based on gender, even in different industries. Although progress has been made, change is slow. The increasing presence of women in leadership positions and the growing acceptance of stay-at-home fathers are positive signs, but more work is needed to overcome deeply ingrained societal biases.",
            "The speaker explains the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They argue that decriminalization, which treats possession as a minor offense like a traffic ticket, reduces the harsh consequences associated with criminal charges. While future ramifications like job interview issues may still exist, decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. The speaker believes this frees up funds that could be used for more beneficial public services. They acknowledge that some communities oppose decriminalization due to moral reasons. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a positive step that allows for greater financial flexibility. The speaker also discusses the potential downsides of full legalization, such as increased accessibility and potential for public consumption, which they believe could be awkward and socially unacceptable. Finally, they acknowledge that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects, and individual reactions to these substances vary greatly.",
            "I believe Catholicism has both positive and negative aspects. While tradition is important, the Church can be inflexible and resistant to change. Many Catholics feel obligated to attend church weekly and adhere strictly to doctrines.  This strictness can lead to judgment towards those who don't perfectly follow the rules, including those from different religions.\n\nFor example, my parents faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church often emphasizes certain actions but its practices contradict these teachings, seeming outdated.\n\nWhile allowing priests to marry might seem appealing, I doubt it would prevent child abuse.  Abuse stems from a fundamental issue and is not directly linked to a priest's marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue, so I can't say definitively whether either side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most challenging topics we face because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage. \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense to anyone.  I think civil unions might be a better approach.  \n\nInstead of the government defining marriage, especially considering its religious significance, perhaps it should be viewed like baptism, where the government doesn't intervene in religious matters.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, it doesn't matter what kind of ceremony they had. They are united, and the government shouldn't differentiate based on religious beliefs.\n\nIf all states agree on a solution, they should push for federal law.  \n\nI strongly oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution for something this personal and  important to certain groups, but not fundamentally affecting the nation, seems excessive.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I feel strongly that this issue should be decided at the state level rather than by the federal government.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings; Democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while Republican states may oppose it.  Individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by that state's government.\n\nI believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalizing same-sex marriage at the state level allows for individual states to make decisions that reflect the values of their residents. \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't think he should dictate the laws of every state. It's more appropriate for decisions like this to be made at a local level, where citizens are directly affected.  The issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is president, so it's best to leave it to the states to determine what's best for their communities.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials were justified in viewing a student's profile. They argue that anything posted online is accessible to anyone, including school officials, regardless of whether they are accessing it through a school device. While acknowledging that searching for student misconduct solely on social media is an invasion of privacy, the speaker feels that if there are legitimate concerns about student safety or potential harm, school officials' actions are justifiable. \n\nThe speaker uses the example of school security drills and the need to prevent incidents like Columbine to illustrate the school's responsibility to ensure student safety. They emphasize that, ultimately, the school's goal is to create a safe environment for all students, and viewing a student's online activity can be a tool to achieve that goal.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 had a profound personal impact on me.  I felt strongly about retaliating against those responsible for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went into the conflict unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired.\n\nI've become disillusioned with the situation. I feel the internal conflicts within Iraq prevent them from addressing external threats, making our presence ineffective.  I've become detached from the situation, even questioning the humanity of the people involved due to their constant fighting.\n\nOur understanding of war differs greatly from theirs. Their approach is more brutal and less about national betterment, which makes it difficult to achieve our objectives.  I believe we should leave Iraq and allow them to resolve their own issues. \n\nThe initial decision to go to war was likely fueled by public sentiment and a desire for revenge, rather than rational analysis. While I understand the pressure on President Bush to act after 9/11, I believe a more thoughtful and comprehensive plan was needed. The lack of a clear objective and unity of purpose contributed to our difficulties.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing the deeply ingrained cultural and political dynamics of Iraq.  I fear that any progress we make will be short-lived, and our continued presence is ultimately detrimental to both ourselves and Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views to avoid losing members. They cite issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control as examples of where the Church's stance feels outdated and alienates people.  The speaker feels that if the Church were more accepting of diverse viewpoints, it wouldn't face this decline in followers. \n\nThey also suggest that allowing female priests and married priests could help bridge the gap with modern society. While acknowledging that these changes might not have prevented past scandals, the speaker believes they could contribute to a more inclusive and relevant Church.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to prevent same-sex couples from marrying. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but deny that right to same-sex couples. It feels like a personal matter, and the federal government shouldn't intervene in people's lives regarding their relationships.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there are no compelling reasons against it. While some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, this is unfounded. Gay relationships are diverse and should not be conflated with heterosexual relationships.  \n\nDenying marriage equality to LGBTQ+ individuals deprives them of crucial civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a sick partner might be barred from visiting their loved one in the hospital due to legal limitations. \n\nScientific research shows that same-sex couples experience similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. Ultimately, marriage is a legal contract, not a religious sacrament, and the government should not interfere with personal choices in this regard.\n\nConcerns about adoption and societal impacts are often based on unfounded fears. Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The real issue often lies in societal prejudice and discrimination, as evidenced by instances of bullying and exclusion faced by children of LGBTQ+ parents. \n\nThe government should ensure equal rights for all its citizens, including LGBTQ+ individuals, by legalizing gay marriage nationwide.  It's hypocritical to oppose same-sex marriage while simultaneously upholding the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance, demonstrating a selective application of religious values in public policy.\n\nFinally, the notion that homosexuality stems from psychological damage is scientifically inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked this myth, and it's crucial to rely on evidence-based information rather than prejudices and unfounded beliefs.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that even though a drug is illegal, it doesn't automatically mean it's harmful. I think making marijuana accessible for medicinal purposes is a good idea because its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply due to its legal status.  \n\nMany controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are used in pharmacies for their medicinal value.  It's unfair to deny marijuana the same consideration just because of societal stigma. We should embrace its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that alcohol can also be harmful if abused, I believe marijuana, if used responsibly, has less potential for abuse.  I think a gradual integration of marijuana into society, starting with legalizing it for medical purposes, would be beneficial. Removing the stigma surrounding marijuana is crucial to encouraging responsible use.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. However, it's not as dangerous as drugs like heroin or cocaine. If we change the perception of marijuana as a harmful substance, people might be more likely to use it responsibly, especially for medicinal reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting a shift towards casual attire and shorter services. They observe a change in the atmosphere, with more casual dress and families arriving late to mass. While they acknowledge the church's stance on priestly celibacy, they don't believe allowing priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia, suggesting that it stems from individual predispositions rather than the lack of marriage. They argue that individuals with this inclination may still develop it even if married. The speaker also believes that genetics plays a role in pedophilia, making it difficult to conceal. They criticize the church for covering up instances of abuse but acknowledge that not all cases were necessarily known.",
            "The speaker expresses deep disapproval of the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses used by the Bush administration to justify invading Iraq. They criticize the administration for misleading the American people about the connection between Iraq, Osama Bin Laden, and 9/11, as well as their claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.  The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and possibly even an impeachable offense. \n\nThey also believe the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution and had a pre-existing intention to go to war.  The speaker suggests that the younger Bush's personal feelings towards Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and a desire to secure energy resources may have influenced the decision to invade. \n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the U.S. withdraws immediately, the speaker remains critical of the current political situation in Iraq. They express concerns about the UN and U.S. proposed solution of a coalition of surrounding nations taking control, fearing it will further complicate matters by undermining Iraqi sovereignty.  The speaker highlights the ineffectiveness of the Iraqi Parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the continued influence of radical factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party, all of which contribute to the instability and uncertainty in the country.",
            "The speaker expresses a conflicted view on the War in Iraq. They believe it was initially motivated by a desire for revenge for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose, seeing it as an attempt to impose American democracy and access oil. They acknowledge the difficulties of establishing democracy in Iraq and the potential negative consequences of both withdrawing or remaining. They also express concerns about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. While acknowledging the personal sacrifices of soldiers and the suffering of Iraqi civilians, they ultimately believe that the war is counterproductive and will likely lead to further instability and resentment towards the United States.",
            "The speaker firmly believes that the government should not be involved in legalizing or criminalizing certain practices, particularly those related to religion. They argue that the separation of church and state, as enshrined in the Constitution, prevents the government from imposing its will on religious beliefs. They feel that attempts to create a law or amendment regarding this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious perspective over others.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that religious decisions should be left to individual churches and denominations, as different faiths hold diverse views. They see the proposed amendment as a personal crusade driven by the initiator's own Catholic beliefs, rather than a legitimate societal concern. They believe it would be an unusual amendment, unlike others, which typically aim to restrict government power rather than individual freedoms. The speaker concludes that such an amendment is unnecessary and potentially beneficial to society.",
            "The speaker believes the US government was dishonest with the American people about the reasons for invading Iraq, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They oppose preemptive war and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the US government for not anticipating the chaos and insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein's government, arguing that the US attempted to deceive the public about the ease of establishing democracy in Iraq. \n\nThey acknowledge the difficulty of withdrawing from Iraq after years of involvement, but also question the high cost in American lives for a \"free democratic Iraq.\" The speaker further criticizes the US government's inconsistencies in dealing with other countries, like North Korea, which have weapons of mass destruction, suggesting that oil and resource control are more significant factors in US foreign policy. \n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses a hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has biological roots rather than being solely sociological. Denying individuals rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane.  \n\nI believe politics and government should stay out of this issue. Marriage is a personal and family matter, not a governmental one. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live and function like any other family, even though they can't marry. \n\nI think President Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation are misguided. \n\nScientific evidence suggests that sexual orientation may have a biological basis, possibly even a chemical component in the brain, rather than being influenced by upbringing or environmental factors. \n\nOne of the key issues is the public scrutiny gay couples face when seeking to marry. While heterosexual couples can easily get married privately, gay couples' unions often become public events. Marriage should be a private matter, not a public and political one.",
            "Posting information online makes it publicly accessible.  It can influence people's perceptions of you, and serious topics like threats or violence should be avoided. While it's important to remember that not everything online is meant to be taken seriously, schools have a responsibility to address potential threats.  \n\nA person's online activity can be alarming to others, even if it was intended as a joke.  Schools may be alerted to potentially dangerous content by students or concerned individuals. Since anything shared online is publicly accessible, there's a limited expectation of privacy.\n\nIt's important to be mindful of what you post online, as it can have real-world consequences. Schools should not actively monitor students' online activity, but they are obligated to take seriously any information brought to their attention that suggests a potential threat.",
            "The speaker believes the war has become too prolonged and has strayed from its original purpose. They initially supported the war as a means to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system. However, they now feel that the goal has been obscured, and the war is perhaps driven by a desire to assert global dominance.  The speaker also questions the initial motivations, suggesting potential personal conflicts involving former President George H.W. Bush and Saddam Hussein may have influenced the decision to go to war.\n\nWhile the speaker acknowledges the initial purpose of bringing democracy to the country, they argue that the war has lost its justification. They believe the initial goal was achieved in the early stages, and the prolonged conflict feels unnecessary.  The speaker emphasizes that the war has become financially draining, diverting resources from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. They feel the money spent on the war could be better allocated to address these pressing domestic concerns.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of someone finding potentially harmful information on social media profiles and preventing a tragedy. They acknowledge that information shared online is generally public, but question the extent to which someone should be able to monitor profiles for potential threats. The speaker expresses concern about the possibility of discrimination and the impracticality of having someone constantly watch profiles. They also share personal experiences with online privacy concerns, mentioning instances where strangers knew personal details about them from their social media presence. The speaker concludes by mentioning a situation where a high school banned students from using Myspace, questioning the school's authority to restrict students' access to the platform.",
            "I feel hesitant to discuss the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it. However, it's impossible to ignore the overwhelming global consensus that the war was a mistake, including within Iraq itself and even among U.S. troops currently stationed there.  \n\nWhile I acknowledge that Saddam Hussein was a dictator, I believe invading Iraq was a catastrophic decision with disastrous consequences. The cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make it impossible to impose democracy on the region. The war has been a failure from the start, and withdrawing is likely to be equally challenging. \n\nAlthough I understand the administration may have reasons for wanting to stay, I haven't heard any convincing arguments. If they plan to withdraw gradually, that's acceptable. However, the Iraqi people themselves have repeatedly expressed their desire for us to leave, and I believe we should respect their wishes.  Leaving might be messy, but at least it would demonstrate that we are listening to the people we are trying to help.",
            "I believe gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States, and it's not just against women. The specific field of work can also play a role. While women generally face more obstacles due to societal expectations and the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also be discriminated against. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children might face judgment and disapproval from society that expects them to be the primary breadwinners. Similarly, men in the fashion industry might be doubted or taken less seriously simply because of their gender, as the field is often associated with femininity. These examples illustrate how societal norms and stereotypes can lead to discrimination based on gender, even in different industries. Although progress has been made, change is slow. The increasing presence of women in leadership positions and the growing acceptance of stay-at-home fathers are positive signs, but more work is needed to overcome deeply ingrained societal biases.",
            "The speaker explains the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They argue that decriminalization, which treats possession as a minor offense like a traffic ticket, reduces the harsh consequences associated with criminal charges. While future ramifications like job interview issues may still exist, decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. The speaker believes this frees up funds that could be used for more beneficial public services. They acknowledge that some communities oppose decriminalization due to moral reasons. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, decriminalization is seen as a positive step that allows for greater financial flexibility. The speaker also discusses the potential downsides of full legalization, such as increased accessibility and potential for public consumption, which they believe could be awkward and socially unacceptable. Finally, they acknowledge that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects, and individual reactions to these substances vary greatly.",
            "I believe Catholicism has both positive and negative aspects. While tradition is important, the Church can be inflexible and resistant to change. Many Catholics feel obligated to attend church weekly and adhere strictly to doctrines.  This strictness can lead to judgment towards those who don't perfectly follow the rules, including those from different religions.\n\nFor example, my parents faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This lack of tolerance contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others. The Church often emphasizes certain actions but its practices contradict these teachings, seeming outdated.\n\nWhile allowing priests to marry might seem appealing, I doubt it would prevent child abuse.  Abuse stems from a fundamental issue and is not directly linked to a priest's marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue, so I can't say definitively whether either side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is one of the most challenging topics we face because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage. \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense to anyone.  I think civil unions might be a better approach.  \n\nInstead of the government defining marriage, especially considering its religious significance, perhaps it should be viewed like baptism, where the government doesn't intervene in religious matters.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, it doesn't matter what kind of ceremony they had. They are united, and the government shouldn't differentiate based on religious beliefs.\n\nIf all states agree on a solution, they should push for federal law.  \n\nI strongly oppose a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage. Amending the constitution for something this personal and  important to certain groups, but not fundamentally affecting the nation, seems excessive.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I feel strongly that this issue should be decided at the state level rather than by the federal government.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings; Democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while Republican states may oppose it.  Individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by that state's government.\n\nI believe homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and legalizing same-sex marriage at the state level allows for individual states to make decisions that reflect the values of their residents. \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't think he should dictate the laws of every state. It's more appropriate for decisions like this to be made at a local level, where citizens are directly affected.  The issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is president, so it's best to leave it to the states to determine what's best for their communities.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials were justified in viewing a student's profile. They argue that anything posted online is accessible to anyone, including school officials, regardless of whether they are accessing it through a school device. While acknowledging that searching for student misconduct solely on social media is an invasion of privacy, the speaker feels that if there are legitimate concerns about student safety or potential harm, school officials' actions are justifiable. \n\nThe speaker uses the example of school security drills and the need to prevent incidents like Columbine to illustrate the school's responsibility to ensure student safety. They emphasize that, ultimately, the school's goal is to create a safe environment for all students, and viewing a student's online activity can be a tool to achieve that goal.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 had a profound personal impact on me.  I felt strongly about retaliating against those responsible for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went into the conflict unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired.\n\nI've become disillusioned with the situation. I feel the internal conflicts within Iraq prevent them from addressing external threats, making our presence ineffective.  I've become detached from the situation, even questioning the humanity of the people involved due to their constant fighting.\n\nOur understanding of war differs greatly from theirs. Their approach is more brutal and less about national betterment, which makes it difficult to achieve our objectives.  I believe we should leave Iraq and allow them to resolve their own issues. \n\nThe initial decision to go to war was likely fueled by public sentiment and a desire for revenge, rather than rational analysis. While I understand the pressure on President Bush to act after 9/11, I believe a more thoughtful and comprehensive plan was needed. The lack of a clear objective and unity of purpose contributed to our difficulties.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing the deeply ingrained cultural and political dynamics of Iraq.  I fear that any progress we make will be short-lived, and our continued presence is ultimately detrimental to both ourselves and Iraq."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes that the Catholic Church needs to update its views on several issues to prevent further decline in followers. They argue that the Church's stance on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is considered outdated by many, leading to disagreement and alienation.  The speaker acknowledges the Church's right to hold these views but suggests that a more modern perspective could be beneficial. They also mention the issue of priests being celibate, questioning why they cannot be married like other professionals who balance their work and family lives. The speaker concludes by expressing their belief that allowing priests to marry would not necessarily have prevented the recent scandals but could offer a more relatable and contemporary approach.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held accountable for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow opposite-sex couples to marry but not same-sex couples. \n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter and doesn't involve national security or morality.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legal because there's no valid reason to oppose it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but this comparison is flawed.  Marriage equality is about civil rights, including access to benefits like healthcare and property ownership, which are denied to unmarried partners. Scientific research shows that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nOpponents often cite religious objections, but legal marriage is a government matter, not a religious one. Denying marriage rights based on religion is discriminatory. Allowing civil unions but not marriage creates a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nConcerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded. Children of same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. Fears about societal influence are based on prejudice, not evidence.  \n\nThe federal government should ensure marriage equality across all states. President Bush's stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are rooted in religious morality. However, government policies should not be dictated by a single religious viewpoint, as this undermines the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. \n\nDismissing homosexuality as a psychological defect based on outdated beliefs is harmful and inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. Public discourse should be based on scientific evidence and empathy, not prejudice and misinformation.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that the illegality of a substance doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't support making marijuana readily available to the public, I think it should be used for medical purposes.  Many illegal drugs, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits.  \n\nI don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, although both can be abused.  I believe marijuana should be gradually legalized to prevent widespread abuse, but the stigma surrounding it needs to be addressed first.  \n\nThe negative image of marijuana stems from its illegal status, which makes people perceive it as dangerous.  However, it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine.  If we change that perception, people might use marijuana responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, moving away from strictness. They observe changes like shorter masses, casual attire, and a designated mass for teenagers. While they acknowledge these changes, they don't delve into the church's internal politics. Regarding the issue of pedophilia among priests, the speaker doesn't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these occurrences, attributing the issue to individual genetics rather than societal factors. They believe pedophilia is inherent and cannot be masked by marriage. While condemning any cover-ups, they suggest that the church may not have always been aware of these instances.",
            "I initially agreed with the idea of the Iraq War, but the events of 9/11 heavily influenced the situation. The Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to justify the war, falsely claiming links between Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and weapons of mass destruction. These claims have since been proven false, and this dishonesty deeply troubles me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions seem like a blatant lie to the American people, an impeachable offense. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this administration disrespects the Constitution and has been undermining it since 9/11.\n\nIt appears they entered office with a pre-existing desire for war, possibly driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's administration and a desire to secure energy resources. This approach is manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and further bloodshed. The proposed alternative involves a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could create long-term problems.\n\nThe current Iraqi government is struggling. The Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control. Powerful figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we fought against recently, now hold significant political influence. This creates a highly volatile political landscape with various factions vying for power, making the situation extremely complex.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty and confusion about the War in Iraq. They believe it's pointless and driven more by revenge than legitimate reasons, questioning the long-term goal of establishing a US-style democracy in Iraq. They acknowledge the complexities of the situation, highlighting the potential for both positive and negative consequences depending on whether the US stays or leaves. The speaker acknowledges the human cost of the war, considering the impact on families with loved ones serving in Iraq and the lives of Iraqi civilians. They worry about the potential for increased resentment and instability if the US continues to exert influence in Iraq, fearing it could fuel further conflict and extremism. Ultimately, the speaker believes the war is likely to drag on indefinitely, leaving a legacy of damage and uncertainty.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere in this issue, citing the separation of church and state as a fundamental principle enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate morality or religious beliefs would violate this principle and amount to favoring one religious perspective over others. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the idea of a constitutional amendment banning the practice, viewing it as a restrictive measure that contradicts the Constitution's emphasis on religious tolerance. They believe it would be unique in its purpose, aiming to limit individual freedoms rather than government powers. \n\nThe speaker concludes that the decision regarding the legality of the practice should rest solely with individual churches and religious institutions, not the government. They see no compelling reason for government intervention, suggesting that the proposal stems solely from personal beliefs rather than any tangible societal benefit.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, connecting it to the September 11th attacks despite limited real connection.  They are fundamentally against war, particularly preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. The speaker criticizes the US for attempting to install a democratic government in Iraq without sufficient planning or understanding of the complexities involved, comparing it to the US's own long struggle to establish democracy. They believe the US government underestimated the challenges and misled the public about the war's feasibility and potential outcomes. The speaker questions the US's motivations for the war, suggesting oil and resource control may be at play, and points to the lack of found weapons of mass destruction as evidence of flawed government decision-making. They express hope for peace and a swift end to the conflict, but remain skeptical.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has a biological basis rather than being solely sociological.  Denying people rights based on something they can't control feels inhumane. I've consistently advocated for gay marriage rights.\n\nI believe politics and government shouldn't interfere in this deeply personal matter. It's a matter of individual families, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function like any other family, raising dogs, walking the streets, but they can't legally marry.  \n\nPresident Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation seem misguided. It's disrespectful to dictate personal choices.\n\nScientific studies indicate that homosexuality may be linked to biological factors, such as brain chemistry, rather than environmental influences like upbringing.\n\nBeyond the ethical aspect, the disparity in how society treats gay couples compared to heterosexual couples is striking.  Heterosexual couples can easily marry privately, while gay couples face public scrutiny and legal hurdles.  Marriage should be a private matter between individuals, not subject to public or federal regulation.",
            "Posting online is like putting information in a public square; everyone can see it.  This means your words can influence how people perceive you. If you post about violence or threats, someone might take it seriously, and the school could be obligated to investigate.  \n\nWhile some online posts might be harmless jokes, others could be genuine threats. It's important to remember that there's no true privacy online. If you don't want something seen, don't post it.\n\nSchools should avoid monitoring students' social media profiles unless they receive specific information about potential danger.  It's inappropriate for teachers to create fake accounts to befriend students, as that crosses a boundary. Just as an R.A. wouldn't want to know about their residents' personal lives on social media, teachers shouldn't feel the need to monitor their students' online activity unless there's a legitimate concern.",
            "The speaker believes the war has dragged on for too long and feels the initial purpose of restoring democracy has been lost. They suspect the motives might have been questionable from the start, potentially stemming from personal conflicts between George Bush Senior and Saddam Hussein. While the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking fair political systems could have been justified, they argue the prolonged conflict seems driven by a desire to assert American superpower status rather than a genuine commitment to democracy. \n\nThe speaker believes the war's initial impact, demonstrating American military might, was sufficient to achieve its stated objective. However, the years-long continuation drains the economy, diverting funds from pressing domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They feel the war's purpose has been distorted, and it's now more about maintaining a presence than achieving a clear victory or lasting peace. Ultimately, the speaker believes the war has run its course and should end, allowing the Iraqi government and people to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethics of online privacy, particularly regarding MySpace. They argue that posting information online means accepting that it can be seen by others, but acknowledge the discomfort of knowing \"creepy people\" can access personal details. They cite an example of a man easily finding and contacting a girl through online platforms, highlighting the potential dangers. \n\nThe speaker also discusses the difficulty of balancing online communication with privacy concerns, mentioning how they try to limit their online presence while still connecting with friends. They express surprise at schools banning MySpace, questioning the legality and appropriateness of such a restriction.",
            "The speaker expresses their stance on the Iraq War, acknowledging the overwhelming global consensus against it, including among Iraqi citizens and U.S. troops stationed there. They believe the war was a mistake from the outset and that continuing the presence is also detrimental. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the administration's rationale for staying, arguing that the cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make imposing democracy there futile and ultimately disastrous. While acknowledging Saddam Hussein's tyranny, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading a country, particularly one that has become so destabilized.  \n\nThe speaker advocates for a gradual withdrawal within a year, but ultimately believes the U.S. should leave as soon as possible, respecting the Iraqi people's desire for independence. They acknowledge the complexities of the Middle East and the perception of the U.S. as an aggressor, but propose that a withdrawal, even if messy, would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just women who face challenges; it also depends on the industry. Women often encounter a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations that associate leadership roles with men.  \n\nSimilarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home fathers often face judgment because traditional gender roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. \n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where straight men interested in fashion may be perceived as lacking authenticity by colleagues who associate the field primarily with women.  \n\nUltimately, societal change is slow but ongoing. As more women assume leadership positions and stay-at-home dads become more accepted, these stereotypes are gradually being challenged.  \n\nIt's important to promote positive examples and highlight the skills and talents of individuals regardless of their gender or background, rather than forcing change, as this can lead to resistance.",
            "The speaker believes that decriminalizing marijuana is preferable to outright legalization. They argue that decriminalization reduces the severity of penalties for possession, treating it more like a traffic violation rather than a criminal offense.  While future ramifications like job interview concerns still exist, the speaker feels decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and legal representation. They suggest that these funds can be redirected to more beneficial programs like education and social services. \n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities may oppose decriminalization due to moral or philosophical reasons. They also express concern about the potential for widespread marijuana use if it were fully legalized, comparing it to cigarettes and the possibility of increased smoking and driving. They believe that marijuana use remains taboo in many contexts and that open legalization could lead to social awkwardness.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges that both alcohol and marijuana have negative effects, but argues that marijuana's impact tends to be more detrimental to lifestyle than alcohol's effects on motor skills. They emphasize the individual variability in how people react to substances, making it difficult to generalize about their overall impact.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is admirable but feels it hinders adaptability and inclusivity. They criticize the Church's strict doctrines and perceived intolerance towards those who don't adhere perfectly or belong to different faiths, citing the refusal to marry their Episcopalian father and Catholic mother as an example.  \n\nThe speaker observes a disconnect between Catholic teachings of love and acceptance and the Church's practices, which they find hypocritical. They also discuss the issue of pedophilia within the Church, expressing skepticism that allowing married priests would deter such behavior, arguing that it stems from a deeper issue unrelated to marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue and can't say who is right or wrong. However, I believe it's the most challenging topic we face today because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage.  \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense.  I think civil unions are the way to go.  \n\nI don't believe the government should define marriage, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  After all, the government doesn't offer tax breaks or special treatment based on religious practices like baptism.  \n\nIf two people are in a union, whether it's a civil union or a marriage, the government shouldn't inquire about its religious nature.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, I think it should be treated like any other civil union. The government shouldn't interfere in how couples choose to define their relationships.\n\nIdeally, states should come to a logical consensus and make it federal law. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive.  The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't a significant enough issue to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has made my views on homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and believe they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, I personally don't agree with their lifestyle. However, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided at the state level rather than nationally. I think different states, with their diverse political leanings, should have the autonomy to make this decision for themselves.\n\nFor example, democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and residents of those states should respect the choices made by their elected officials. Conversely, individuals living in states with different viewpoints should accept those decisions as well.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as I believe it's inappropriate for one person to dictate the laws of every state. States should have the freedom to govern themselves, and this issue is best left to their individual residents. Furthermore, with a potential change in presidential administrations in the near future, the ongoing back-and-forth on this issue would be unnecessary. The states themselves, who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions, should be the ones to decide.",
            "I believe that school officials have the right to access student's Myspace profiles because it's a public platform.  Even though students might not intend for school officials to see their posts, anything online can be accessed by anyone, including those in authority.  \n\nWhile I understand that searching for information about students' personal lives on social media can feel like an invasion of privacy, I think it's justifiable if it helps prevent harm or makes the school a safer environment.  \n\nIt's important to remember that everything we post online is potentially public and can have lasting consequences.  Just like we shouldn't share sensitive information in emails, we should be mindful of what we post on social media, knowing that it could be seen by a wider audience than intended.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and if monitoring social media helps them achieve that goal, I believe it's a necessary measure.",
            "Initially, I supported the war in Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about retaliating for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired. \n\nI have grown disillusioned with the situation. I don't believe our presence is effective as long as internal conflict continues within Iraq. Their internal struggles prevent them from uniting against us.  I've become detached from their situation, even feeling a sense of animosity towards them because of their constant fighting and inability to govern themselves.\n\nI recognize that the war was a deeply emotional response, but I believe it was fueled by a desire for revenge rather than rational thinking. President Bush felt pressured to act due to public sentiment following 9/11. While I understand the initial need to respond, I believe a more thoughtful approach was necessary. \n\nWe lacked a clear plan for establishing order and there was a lack of unity in our objectives. This, combined with the cultural differences in how war is waged, made the conflict more complex and challenging.\n\nI don't think we are equipped to change Iraqi society. I believe their internal conflicts will persist regardless of our involvement, and I question the value of our continued presence.  We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying indefinitely. I fear that any progress will be lost once we leave, and we are ultimately harming ourselves by remaining."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes that the Catholic Church needs to update its views on several issues to prevent further decline in followers. They argue that the Church's stance on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is considered outdated by many, leading to disagreement and alienation.  The speaker acknowledges the Church's right to hold these views but suggests that a more modern perspective could be beneficial. They also mention the issue of priests being celibate, questioning why they cannot be married like other professionals who balance their work and family lives. The speaker concludes by expressing their belief that allowing priests to marry would not necessarily have prevented the recent scandals but could offer a more relatable and contemporary approach.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held accountable for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow opposite-sex couples to marry but not same-sex couples. \n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter and doesn't involve national security or morality.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legal because there's no valid reason to oppose it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but this comparison is flawed.  Marriage equality is about civil rights, including access to benefits like healthcare and property ownership, which are denied to unmarried partners. Scientific research shows that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nOpponents often cite religious objections, but legal marriage is a government matter, not a religious one. Denying marriage rights based on religion is discriminatory. Allowing civil unions but not marriage creates a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nConcerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded. Children of same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. Fears about societal influence are based on prejudice, not evidence.  \n\nThe federal government should ensure marriage equality across all states. President Bush's stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are rooted in religious morality. However, government policies should not be dictated by a single religious viewpoint, as this undermines the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. \n\nDismissing homosexuality as a psychological defect based on outdated beliefs is harmful and inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. Public discourse should be based on scientific evidence and empathy, not prejudice and misinformation.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that the illegality of a substance doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't support making marijuana readily available to the public, I think it should be used for medical purposes.  Many illegal drugs, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits.  \n\nI don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, although both can be abused.  I believe marijuana should be gradually legalized to prevent widespread abuse, but the stigma surrounding it needs to be addressed first.  \n\nThe negative image of marijuana stems from its illegal status, which makes people perceive it as dangerous.  However, it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine.  If we change that perception, people might use marijuana responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, moving away from strictness. They observe changes like shorter masses, casual attire, and a designated mass for teenagers. While they acknowledge these changes, they don't delve into the church's internal politics. Regarding the issue of pedophilia among priests, the speaker doesn't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these occurrences, attributing the issue to individual genetics rather than societal factors. They believe pedophilia is inherent and cannot be masked by marriage. While condemning any cover-ups, they suggest that the church may not have always been aware of these instances.",
            "I initially agreed with the idea of the Iraq War, but the events of 9/11 heavily influenced the situation. The Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to justify the war, falsely claiming links between Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and weapons of mass destruction. These claims have since been proven false, and this dishonesty deeply troubles me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions seem like a blatant lie to the American people, an impeachable offense. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this administration disrespects the Constitution and has been undermining it since 9/11.\n\nIt appears they entered office with a pre-existing desire for war, possibly driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's administration and a desire to secure energy resources. This approach is manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and further bloodshed. The proposed alternative involves a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could create long-term problems.\n\nThe current Iraqi government is struggling. The Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control. Powerful figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we fought against recently, now hold significant political influence. This creates a highly volatile political landscape with various factions vying for power, making the situation extremely complex.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty and confusion about the War in Iraq. They believe it's pointless and driven more by revenge than legitimate reasons, questioning the long-term goal of establishing a US-style democracy in Iraq. They acknowledge the complexities of the situation, highlighting the potential for both positive and negative consequences depending on whether the US stays or leaves. The speaker acknowledges the human cost of the war, considering the impact on families with loved ones serving in Iraq and the lives of Iraqi civilians. They worry about the potential for increased resentment and instability if the US continues to exert influence in Iraq, fearing it could fuel further conflict and extremism. Ultimately, the speaker believes the war is likely to drag on indefinitely, leaving a legacy of damage and uncertainty.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere in this issue, citing the separation of church and state as a fundamental principle enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate morality or religious beliefs would violate this principle and amount to favoring one religious perspective over others. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the idea of a constitutional amendment banning the practice, viewing it as a restrictive measure that contradicts the Constitution's emphasis on religious tolerance. They believe it would be unique in its purpose, aiming to limit individual freedoms rather than government powers. \n\nThe speaker concludes that the decision regarding the legality of the practice should rest solely with individual churches and religious institutions, not the government. They see no compelling reason for government intervention, suggesting that the proposal stems solely from personal beliefs rather than any tangible societal benefit.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, connecting it to the September 11th attacks despite limited real connection.  They are fundamentally against war, particularly preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. The speaker criticizes the US for attempting to install a democratic government in Iraq without sufficient planning or understanding of the complexities involved, comparing it to the US's own long struggle to establish democracy. They believe the US government underestimated the challenges and misled the public about the war's feasibility and potential outcomes. The speaker questions the US's motivations for the war, suggesting oil and resource control may be at play, and points to the lack of found weapons of mass destruction as evidence of flawed government decision-making. They express hope for peace and a swift end to the conflict, but remain skeptical.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has a biological basis rather than being solely sociological.  Denying people rights based on something they can't control feels inhumane. I've consistently advocated for gay marriage rights.\n\nI believe politics and government shouldn't interfere in this deeply personal matter. It's a matter of individual families, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function like any other family, raising dogs, walking the streets, but they can't legally marry.  \n\nPresident Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation seem misguided. It's disrespectful to dictate personal choices.\n\nScientific studies indicate that homosexuality may be linked to biological factors, such as brain chemistry, rather than environmental influences like upbringing.\n\nBeyond the ethical aspect, the disparity in how society treats gay couples compared to heterosexual couples is striking.  Heterosexual couples can easily marry privately, while gay couples face public scrutiny and legal hurdles.  Marriage should be a private matter between individuals, not subject to public or federal regulation.",
            "Posting online is like putting information in a public square; everyone can see it.  This means your words can influence how people perceive you. If you post about violence or threats, someone might take it seriously, and the school could be obligated to investigate.  \n\nWhile some online posts might be harmless jokes, others could be genuine threats. It's important to remember that there's no true privacy online. If you don't want something seen, don't post it.\n\nSchools should avoid monitoring students' social media profiles unless they receive specific information about potential danger.  It's inappropriate for teachers to create fake accounts to befriend students, as that crosses a boundary. Just as an R.A. wouldn't want to know about their residents' personal lives on social media, teachers shouldn't feel the need to monitor their students' online activity unless there's a legitimate concern.",
            "The speaker believes the war has dragged on for too long and feels the initial purpose of restoring democracy has been lost. They suspect the motives might have been questionable from the start, potentially stemming from personal conflicts between George Bush Senior and Saddam Hussein. While the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking fair political systems could have been justified, they argue the prolonged conflict seems driven by a desire to assert American superpower status rather than a genuine commitment to democracy. \n\nThe speaker believes the war's initial impact, demonstrating American military might, was sufficient to achieve its stated objective. However, the years-long continuation drains the economy, diverting funds from pressing domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They feel the war's purpose has been distorted, and it's now more about maintaining a presence than achieving a clear victory or lasting peace. Ultimately, the speaker believes the war has run its course and should end, allowing the Iraqi government and people to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethics of online privacy, particularly regarding MySpace. They argue that posting information online means accepting that it can be seen by others, but acknowledge the discomfort of knowing \"creepy people\" can access personal details. They cite an example of a man easily finding and contacting a girl through online platforms, highlighting the potential dangers. \n\nThe speaker also discusses the difficulty of balancing online communication with privacy concerns, mentioning how they try to limit their online presence while still connecting with friends. They express surprise at schools banning MySpace, questioning the legality and appropriateness of such a restriction.",
            "The speaker expresses their stance on the Iraq War, acknowledging the overwhelming global consensus against it, including among Iraqi citizens and U.S. troops stationed there. They believe the war was a mistake from the outset and that continuing the presence is also detrimental. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the administration's rationale for staying, arguing that the cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make imposing democracy there futile and ultimately disastrous. While acknowledging Saddam Hussein's tyranny, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading a country, particularly one that has become so destabilized.  \n\nThe speaker advocates for a gradual withdrawal within a year, but ultimately believes the U.S. should leave as soon as possible, respecting the Iraqi people's desire for independence. They acknowledge the complexities of the Middle East and the perception of the U.S. as an aggressor, but propose that a withdrawal, even if messy, would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just women who face challenges; it also depends on the industry. Women often encounter a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations that associate leadership roles with men.  \n\nSimilarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home fathers often face judgment because traditional gender roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. \n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where straight men interested in fashion may be perceived as lacking authenticity by colleagues who associate the field primarily with women.  \n\nUltimately, societal change is slow but ongoing. As more women assume leadership positions and stay-at-home dads become more accepted, these stereotypes are gradually being challenged.  \n\nIt's important to promote positive examples and highlight the skills and talents of individuals regardless of their gender or background, rather than forcing change, as this can lead to resistance.",
            "The speaker believes that decriminalizing marijuana is preferable to outright legalization. They argue that decriminalization reduces the severity of penalties for possession, treating it more like a traffic violation rather than a criminal offense.  While future ramifications like job interview concerns still exist, the speaker feels decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and legal representation. They suggest that these funds can be redirected to more beneficial programs like education and social services. \n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities may oppose decriminalization due to moral or philosophical reasons. They also express concern about the potential for widespread marijuana use if it were fully legalized, comparing it to cigarettes and the possibility of increased smoking and driving. They believe that marijuana use remains taboo in many contexts and that open legalization could lead to social awkwardness.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges that both alcohol and marijuana have negative effects, but argues that marijuana's impact tends to be more detrimental to lifestyle than alcohol's effects on motor skills. They emphasize the individual variability in how people react to substances, making it difficult to generalize about their overall impact.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is admirable but feels it hinders adaptability and inclusivity. They criticize the Church's strict doctrines and perceived intolerance towards those who don't adhere perfectly or belong to different faiths, citing the refusal to marry their Episcopalian father and Catholic mother as an example.  \n\nThe speaker observes a disconnect between Catholic teachings of love and acceptance and the Church's practices, which they find hypocritical. They also discuss the issue of pedophilia within the Church, expressing skepticism that allowing married priests would deter such behavior, arguing that it stems from a deeper issue unrelated to marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue and can't say who is right or wrong. However, I believe it's the most challenging topic we face today because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage.  \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense.  I think civil unions are the way to go.  \n\nI don't believe the government should define marriage, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  After all, the government doesn't offer tax breaks or special treatment based on religious practices like baptism.  \n\nIf two people are in a union, whether it's a civil union or a marriage, the government shouldn't inquire about its religious nature.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, I think it should be treated like any other civil union. The government shouldn't interfere in how couples choose to define their relationships.\n\nIdeally, states should come to a logical consensus and make it federal law. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive.  The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't a significant enough issue to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has made my views on homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and believe they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, I personally don't agree with their lifestyle. However, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided at the state level rather than nationally. I think different states, with their diverse political leanings, should have the autonomy to make this decision for themselves.\n\nFor example, democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and residents of those states should respect the choices made by their elected officials. Conversely, individuals living in states with different viewpoints should accept those decisions as well.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as I believe it's inappropriate for one person to dictate the laws of every state. States should have the freedom to govern themselves, and this issue is best left to their individual residents. Furthermore, with a potential change in presidential administrations in the near future, the ongoing back-and-forth on this issue would be unnecessary. The states themselves, who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions, should be the ones to decide.",
            "I believe that school officials have the right to access student's Myspace profiles because it's a public platform.  Even though students might not intend for school officials to see their posts, anything online can be accessed by anyone, including those in authority.  \n\nWhile I understand that searching for information about students' personal lives on social media can feel like an invasion of privacy, I think it's justifiable if it helps prevent harm or makes the school a safer environment.  \n\nIt's important to remember that everything we post online is potentially public and can have lasting consequences.  Just like we shouldn't share sensitive information in emails, we should be mindful of what we post on social media, knowing that it could be seen by a wider audience than intended.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and if monitoring social media helps them achieve that goal, I believe it's a necessary measure.",
            "Initially, I supported the war in Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about retaliating for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired. \n\nI have grown disillusioned with the situation. I don't believe our presence is effective as long as internal conflict continues within Iraq. Their internal struggles prevent them from uniting against us.  I've become detached from their situation, even feeling a sense of animosity towards them because of their constant fighting and inability to govern themselves.\n\nI recognize that the war was a deeply emotional response, but I believe it was fueled by a desire for revenge rather than rational thinking. President Bush felt pressured to act due to public sentiment following 9/11. While I understand the initial need to respond, I believe a more thoughtful approach was necessary. \n\nWe lacked a clear plan for establishing order and there was a lack of unity in our objectives. This, combined with the cultural differences in how war is waged, made the conflict more complex and challenging.\n\nI don't think we are equipped to change Iraqi society. I believe their internal conflicts will persist regardless of our involvement, and I question the value of our continued presence.  We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying indefinitely. I fear that any progress will be lost once we leave, and we are ultimately harming ourselves by remaining."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes that the Catholic Church needs to update its views on several issues to prevent further decline in followers. They argue that the Church's stance on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is considered outdated by many, leading to disagreement and alienation.  The speaker acknowledges the Church's right to hold these views but suggests that a more modern perspective could be beneficial. They also mention the issue of priests being celibate, questioning why they cannot be married like other professionals who balance their work and family lives. The speaker concludes by expressing their belief that allowing priests to marry would not necessarily have prevented the recent scandals but could offer a more relatable and contemporary approach.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held accountable for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow opposite-sex couples to marry but not same-sex couples. \n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter and doesn't involve national security or morality.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people deserve the same rights and respect as everyone else.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legal because there's no valid reason to oppose it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but this comparison is flawed.  Marriage equality is about civil rights, including access to benefits like healthcare and property ownership, which are denied to unmarried partners. Scientific research shows that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nOpponents often cite religious objections, but legal marriage is a government matter, not a religious one. Denying marriage rights based on religion is discriminatory. Allowing civil unions but not marriage creates a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nConcerns about adoption and community impact are unfounded. Children of same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. Fears about societal influence are based on prejudice, not evidence.  \n\nThe federal government should ensure marriage equality across all states. President Bush's stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research, which are rooted in religious morality. However, government policies should not be dictated by a single religious viewpoint, as this undermines the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. \n\nDismissing homosexuality as a psychological defect based on outdated beliefs is harmful and inaccurate. The American Psychological Association has debunked these claims. Public discourse should be based on scientific evidence and empathy, not prejudice and misinformation.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that the illegality of a substance doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal benefits. While I wouldn't support making marijuana readily available to the public, I think it should be used for medical purposes.  Many illegal drugs, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits.  \n\nI don't think marijuana is comparable to alcohol, although both can be abused.  I believe marijuana should be gradually legalized to prevent widespread abuse, but the stigma surrounding it needs to be addressed first.  \n\nThe negative image of marijuana stems from its illegal status, which makes people perceive it as dangerous.  However, it's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine.  If we change that perception, people might use marijuana responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, moving away from strictness. They observe changes like shorter masses, casual attire, and a designated mass for teenagers. While they acknowledge these changes, they don't delve into the church's internal politics. Regarding the issue of pedophilia among priests, the speaker doesn't think allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these occurrences, attributing the issue to individual genetics rather than societal factors. They believe pedophilia is inherent and cannot be masked by marriage. While condemning any cover-ups, they suggest that the church may not have always been aware of these instances.",
            "I initially agreed with the idea of the Iraq War, but the events of 9/11 heavily influenced the situation. The Bush administration used the attacks as a pretext to justify the war, falsely claiming links between Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and weapons of mass destruction. These claims have since been proven false, and this dishonesty deeply troubles me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions seem like a blatant lie to the American people, an impeachable offense. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, now admits he wasn't convinced by it at the time. I believe this administration disrespects the Constitution and has been undermining it since 9/11.\n\nIt appears they entered office with a pre-existing desire for war, possibly driven by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's administration and a desire to secure energy resources. This approach is manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has dragged on for too long, a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and further bloodshed. The proposed alternative involves a coalition of surrounding nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, trying to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could create long-term problems.\n\nThe current Iraqi government is struggling. The Parliament is ineffective, and the Prime Minister lacks control. Powerful figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we fought against recently, now hold significant political influence. This creates a highly volatile political landscape with various factions vying for power, making the situation extremely complex.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty and confusion about the War in Iraq. They believe it's pointless and driven more by revenge than legitimate reasons, questioning the long-term goal of establishing a US-style democracy in Iraq. They acknowledge the complexities of the situation, highlighting the potential for both positive and negative consequences depending on whether the US stays or leaves. The speaker acknowledges the human cost of the war, considering the impact on families with loved ones serving in Iraq and the lives of Iraqi civilians. They worry about the potential for increased resentment and instability if the US continues to exert influence in Iraq, fearing it could fuel further conflict and extremism. Ultimately, the speaker believes the war is likely to drag on indefinitely, leaving a legacy of damage and uncertainty.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere in this issue, citing the separation of church and state as a fundamental principle enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate morality or religious beliefs would violate this principle and amount to favoring one religious perspective over others. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the idea of a constitutional amendment banning the practice, viewing it as a restrictive measure that contradicts the Constitution's emphasis on religious tolerance. They believe it would be unique in its purpose, aiming to limit individual freedoms rather than government powers. \n\nThe speaker concludes that the decision regarding the legality of the practice should rest solely with individual churches and religious institutions, not the government. They see no compelling reason for government intervention, suggesting that the proposal stems solely from personal beliefs rather than any tangible societal benefit.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, connecting it to the September 11th attacks despite limited real connection.  They are fundamentally against war, particularly preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the US government unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government. The speaker criticizes the US for attempting to install a democratic government in Iraq without sufficient planning or understanding of the complexities involved, comparing it to the US's own long struggle to establish democracy. They believe the US government underestimated the challenges and misled the public about the war's feasibility and potential outcomes. The speaker questions the US's motivations for the war, suggesting oil and resource control may be at play, and points to the lack of found weapons of mass destruction as evidence of flawed government decision-making. They express hope for peace and a swift end to the conflict, but remain skeptical.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it has a biological basis rather than being solely sociological.  Denying people rights based on something they can't control feels inhumane. I've consistently advocated for gay marriage rights.\n\nI believe politics and government shouldn't interfere in this deeply personal matter. It's a matter of individual families, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who function like any other family, raising dogs, walking the streets, but they can't legally marry.  \n\nPresident Bush's attempts to define marriage according to his interpretation seem misguided. It's disrespectful to dictate personal choices.\n\nScientific studies indicate that homosexuality may be linked to biological factors, such as brain chemistry, rather than environmental influences like upbringing.\n\nBeyond the ethical aspect, the disparity in how society treats gay couples compared to heterosexual couples is striking.  Heterosexual couples can easily marry privately, while gay couples face public scrutiny and legal hurdles.  Marriage should be a private matter between individuals, not subject to public or federal regulation.",
            "Posting online is like putting information in a public square; everyone can see it.  This means your words can influence how people perceive you. If you post about violence or threats, someone might take it seriously, and the school could be obligated to investigate.  \n\nWhile some online posts might be harmless jokes, others could be genuine threats. It's important to remember that there's no true privacy online. If you don't want something seen, don't post it.\n\nSchools should avoid monitoring students' social media profiles unless they receive specific information about potential danger.  It's inappropriate for teachers to create fake accounts to befriend students, as that crosses a boundary. Just as an R.A. wouldn't want to know about their residents' personal lives on social media, teachers shouldn't feel the need to monitor their students' online activity unless there's a legitimate concern.",
            "The speaker believes the war has dragged on for too long and feels the initial purpose of restoring democracy has been lost. They suspect the motives might have been questionable from the start, potentially stemming from personal conflicts between George Bush Senior and Saddam Hussein. While the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country lacking fair political systems could have been justified, they argue the prolonged conflict seems driven by a desire to assert American superpower status rather than a genuine commitment to democracy. \n\nThe speaker believes the war's initial impact, demonstrating American military might, was sufficient to achieve its stated objective. However, the years-long continuation drains the economy, diverting funds from pressing domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They feel the war's purpose has been distorted, and it's now more about maintaining a presence than achieving a clear victory or lasting peace. Ultimately, the speaker believes the war has run its course and should end, allowing the Iraqi government and people to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethics of online privacy, particularly regarding MySpace. They argue that posting information online means accepting that it can be seen by others, but acknowledge the discomfort of knowing \"creepy people\" can access personal details. They cite an example of a man easily finding and contacting a girl through online platforms, highlighting the potential dangers. \n\nThe speaker also discusses the difficulty of balancing online communication with privacy concerns, mentioning how they try to limit their online presence while still connecting with friends. They express surprise at schools banning MySpace, questioning the legality and appropriateness of such a restriction.",
            "The speaker expresses their stance on the Iraq War, acknowledging the overwhelming global consensus against it, including among Iraqi citizens and U.S. troops stationed there. They believe the war was a mistake from the outset and that continuing the presence is also detrimental. \n\nThe speaker criticizes the administration's rationale for staying, arguing that the cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East make imposing democracy there futile and ultimately disastrous. While acknowledging Saddam Hussein's tyranny, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading a country, particularly one that has become so destabilized.  \n\nThe speaker advocates for a gradual withdrawal within a year, but ultimately believes the U.S. should leave as soon as possible, respecting the Iraqi people's desire for independence. They acknowledge the complexities of the Middle East and the perception of the U.S. as an aggressor, but propose that a withdrawal, even if messy, would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just women who face challenges; it also depends on the industry. Women often encounter a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal expectations that associate leadership roles with men.  \n\nSimilarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home fathers often face judgment because traditional gender roles dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners. \n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where straight men interested in fashion may be perceived as lacking authenticity by colleagues who associate the field primarily with women.  \n\nUltimately, societal change is slow but ongoing. As more women assume leadership positions and stay-at-home dads become more accepted, these stereotypes are gradually being challenged.  \n\nIt's important to promote positive examples and highlight the skills and talents of individuals regardless of their gender or background, rather than forcing change, as this can lead to resistance.",
            "The speaker believes that decriminalizing marijuana is preferable to outright legalization. They argue that decriminalization reduces the severity of penalties for possession, treating it more like a traffic violation rather than a criminal offense.  While future ramifications like job interview concerns still exist, the speaker feels decriminalization saves municipalities money by eliminating the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and legal representation. They suggest that these funds can be redirected to more beneficial programs like education and social services. \n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities may oppose decriminalization due to moral or philosophical reasons. They also express concern about the potential for widespread marijuana use if it were fully legalized, comparing it to cigarettes and the possibility of increased smoking and driving. They believe that marijuana use remains taboo in many contexts and that open legalization could lead to social awkwardness.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges that both alcohol and marijuana have negative effects, but argues that marijuana's impact tends to be more detrimental to lifestyle than alcohol's effects on motor skills. They emphasize the individual variability in how people react to substances, making it difficult to generalize about their overall impact.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is admirable but feels it hinders adaptability and inclusivity. They criticize the Church's strict doctrines and perceived intolerance towards those who don't adhere perfectly or belong to different faiths, citing the refusal to marry their Episcopalian father and Catholic mother as an example.  \n\nThe speaker observes a disconnect between Catholic teachings of love and acceptance and the Church's practices, which they find hypocritical. They also discuss the issue of pedophilia within the Church, expressing skepticism that allowing married priests would deter such behavior, arguing that it stems from a deeper issue unrelated to marital status.",
            "I'm still undecided about this issue and can't say who is right or wrong. However, I believe it's the most challenging topic we face today because it involves a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage.  \n\nIt's difficult to address this without causing offense.  I think civil unions are the way to go.  \n\nI don't believe the government should define marriage, especially since it's considered a sacrament by some.  After all, the government doesn't offer tax breaks or special treatment based on religious practices like baptism.  \n\nIf two people are in a union, whether it's a civil union or a marriage, the government shouldn't inquire about its religious nature.\n\nRegarding gay marriage, I think it should be treated like any other civil union. The government shouldn't interfere in how couples choose to define their relationships.\n\nIdeally, states should come to a logical consensus and make it federal law. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive.  The Constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't a significant enough issue to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has made my views on homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and believe they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, I personally don't agree with their lifestyle. However, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, believing it should be decided at the state level rather than nationally. I think different states, with their diverse political leanings, should have the autonomy to make this decision for themselves.\n\nFor example, democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and residents of those states should respect the choices made by their elected officials. Conversely, individuals living in states with different viewpoints should accept those decisions as well.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's nationwide ban on gay marriage, as I believe it's inappropriate for one person to dictate the laws of every state. States should have the freedom to govern themselves, and this issue is best left to their individual residents. Furthermore, with a potential change in presidential administrations in the near future, the ongoing back-and-forth on this issue would be unnecessary. The states themselves, who will ultimately live with the consequences of their decisions, should be the ones to decide.",
            "I believe that school officials have the right to access student's Myspace profiles because it's a public platform.  Even though students might not intend for school officials to see their posts, anything online can be accessed by anyone, including those in authority.  \n\nWhile I understand that searching for information about students' personal lives on social media can feel like an invasion of privacy, I think it's justifiable if it helps prevent harm or makes the school a safer environment.  \n\nIt's important to remember that everything we post online is potentially public and can have lasting consequences.  Just like we shouldn't share sensitive information in emails, we should be mindful of what we post on social media, knowing that it could be seen by a wider audience than intended.\n\nSchool officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of students, and if monitoring social media helps them achieve that goal, I believe it's a necessary measure.",
            "Initially, I supported the war in Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about retaliating for the attacks. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed careful planning and consideration of the long-term consequences. We went in unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired. \n\nI have grown disillusioned with the situation. I don't believe our presence is effective as long as internal conflict continues within Iraq. Their internal struggles prevent them from uniting against us.  I've become detached from their situation, even feeling a sense of animosity towards them because of their constant fighting and inability to govern themselves.\n\nI recognize that the war was a deeply emotional response, but I believe it was fueled by a desire for revenge rather than rational thinking. President Bush felt pressured to act due to public sentiment following 9/11. While I understand the initial need to respond, I believe a more thoughtful approach was necessary. \n\nWe lacked a clear plan for establishing order and there was a lack of unity in our objectives. This, combined with the cultural differences in how war is waged, made the conflict more complex and challenging.\n\nI don't think we are equipped to change Iraqi society. I believe their internal conflicts will persist regardless of our involvement, and I question the value of our continued presence.  We've made some progress, but it's not enough to justify staying indefinitely. I fear that any progress will be lost once we leave, and we are ultimately harming ourselves by remaining."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views on several issues to retain its followers. They cite instances like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, arguing that the Church's stance on these topics is outdated and alienating people. The speaker suggests that a more modern approach might help the Church avoid losing members, as some are already distancing themselves due to disagreements with the Church's positions. They also question the necessity of celibacy for priests, pointing out that other professions allow for both work and family life.",
            "I'm not against same-sex marriage. I believe sexual orientation is innate, not a choice, so people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow marriage between a man and a woman but deny it to same-sex couples.  Although I haven't deeply considered this issue, it feels wrong to restrict someone's right to marry based on their sexual orientation.  \n\nI don't think the government should interfere in this personal matter. It's not a national security issue or a moral dilemma; it's a personal choice that shouldn't be regulated.  The government shouldn't dictate who people can marry, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and commitment.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there isn't a valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but these relationships are diverse and unique, like two sides of the same coin. \n\nGay couples deserve the same civil rights as heterosexual couples, including healthcare access and property rights. For instance, if one partner is sick, the other can't be present or make medical decisions without legal recognition.  \n\nScientific studies show that gay couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. They seek legal recognition, not religious sanction. It's comparable to legalizing civil unions but denying marriage – a form of segregation.\n\nConcerns arise regarding adoption and societal impact. However, children raised by gay parents adjust well and exhibit similar behaviors.  \n\nSome oppose gay marriage based on religious beliefs or the misconception that homosexuality stems from psychological trauma. These viewpoints are unsubstantiated and contradict findings by reputable organizations like the American Psychological Association.\n\nUltimately, the government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.",
            "Working in a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that a drug's legality doesn't determine its medical value. While I believe making marijuana readily available to the public is a bad idea, I support its use for medicinal purposes. Many illegal drugs, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are used in pharmacies because they provide benefits. Denying those benefits simply because of societal stigma around marijuana is illogical. We should acknowledge its potential therapeutic properties.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is complex. Both can be abused, leading to negative consequences. However, I think a gradual approach to legalization, removing the taboo surrounding marijuana first, could encourage responsible use. This would allow people to see it as a potentially beneficial substance rather than a dangerous one.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and if we shift public perception, people may use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes that the Catholic church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe a shift from formal attire to casual clothing, even at traditional Sunday masses.  The speaker feels this casualization is a positive change, reflecting a move towards greater accessibility.\n\nWhen asked about the Catholic Church's handling of priest sexual abuse scandals, the speaker expresses doubt that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. They argue that pedophilia is a complex issue rooted in individual genetics rather than social factors like celibacy. \n\nThe speaker acknowledges the church's responsibility to address abuse cases and condemns any attempts at cover-ups. However, they believe that some cases might have been genuinely unforeseen.",
            "The speaker strongly criticizes the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses. They argue that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and by claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false. The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense. They also express concern that the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11. \n\nThe speaker believes the war stemmed from a desire for revenge on Saddam Hussein, possibly fueled by the previous administration's experience, and also a desire to secure energy resources. They acknowledge the potential chaos if the US withdrew abruptly, but are skeptical about the proposed alternative of a coalition of neighboring nations intervening.  \n\nThe speaker worries that this would further undermine Iraq's sovereignty and exacerbate political instability. They point to the ineffective Iraqi parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the influence of factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party as evidence of the country's fragile political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses confusion and uncertainty about the War in Iraq, acknowledging that it wasn't officially declared by Congress. They believe it was primarily a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose. They argue that staying in Iraq to establish democracy is a lengthy and potentially futile endeavor, potentially leading to resentment from Iraqis if the U.S. withdraws. The speaker also expresses concern about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. They acknowledge the hardships faced by families with loved ones serving in Iraq but ultimately believe that the U.S. presence exacerbates cultural tensions and fuels resentment, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict.",
            "I strongly believe it's inappropriate for the government, specifically a state, to legalize or criminalize this issue.  The Constitution's separation of church and state clearly delineates this boundary.  Attempting to impose any legal restrictions on this topic would directly contradict the Constitution's principles.  \n\nThose advocating for its criminalization are essentially imposing the beliefs of one religious group over others. While many Catholics and Christians oppose it, it's not the government's role to dictate what religions can and cannot deem legal or illegal.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, ensuring religious tolerance in the United States. Even considering an amendment on this issue would be wrong and contradictory to existing constitutional principles.  Moreover, it would likely be one of the few amendments designed to restrict individual rights rather than government power. \n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government, should not be involved in this matter. The push for an amendment appears to stem from personal religious beliefs rather than broader societal concerns. This preference for one religion over others is concerning.\n\nUltimately, the decision should rest with individual churches, not with politicians or the government. There's no compelling reason to support an amendment banning this practice, as it's unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy or society in a negative way.  It could even potentially have a positive effect.",
            "The speaker believes the U.S. government was not entirely honest with the public about the reasons for the Iraq War, misleadingly linking it to the 9/11 attacks to manipulate public sentiment in favor of invasion. They strongly oppose preemptive war and see the conflict as reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the U.S. government failing to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThe speaker criticizes the U.S. intervention, arguing that the government was unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government and creating a power vacuum. They point to the high number of American casualties and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable democratic government in Iraq, comparing it to the lengthy and difficult process of establishing democracy in the United States itself.\n\nThey express a sense of moral obligation to see the situation through, but also acknowledge the significant human cost involved. The speaker questions the government's motives, suggesting that oil resources and control play a role in the war, and criticizes the lack of transparency and consistency in U.S. foreign policy, citing the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the inaction regarding North Korea's known possession of such weapons.\n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses hope for peace and a swift end to the conflict, but remains skeptical.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference, increasingly supported by evidence suggesting a biological basis rather than a sociological one. Denying people rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, household issue, not a matter for state or federal legislation.  I live in a neighborhood with several openly gay couples who function like any other family, raising dogs, walking the streets, and living their lives. It's absurd for politicians like Bush to attempt to define marriage according to their own interpretation.\n\nResearch indicates that homosexuality may have a biological basis, potentially linked to brain chemistry. It's not a choice, but rather a predisposition.  \n\nThe double standard is clear: a heterosexual couple can marry privately without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to marry becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal matter, not a subject for public or national debate.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public information accessible to everyone.  This means your posts can influence how people perceive you.  If you share content about violence or harmful actions, someone is likely to notice and take action. Schools, for instance, can't ignore threats or concerning posts, even if they seem like jokes.  They have a responsibility to investigate and ensure student safety.\n\nWhile it's important to take online threats seriously, it's also crucial to remember that not everything online is malicious.  Sometimes posts can be misinterpreted or taken out of context.  \n\nHowever, there's no true \"privacy\" on the internet. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your words or what they choose to share.\n\nSchool officials should not actively monitor students' social media profiles, but if concerns are raised by someone who has access to the information, they have a duty to investigate.  It's important to distinguish between monitoring and responding to specific concerns brought to their attention.",
            "I believe the war has dragged on for far too long. While the initial goal was noble – restoring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system – I feel we've lost sight of that purpose. It now seems like we're fighting merely to assert our dominance as a superpower. Additionally, the war's origins might have been tainted by personal vendettas, stemming from disagreements between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the goal was truly to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal motives played a role, it wouldn't be fair. Regardless, the war has clearly overstayed its welcome.\n\nThe initial invasion served its purpose as a statement of power, but prolonging the conflict for years has become counterproductive. We need a decisive end, either victory or withdrawal, rather than this endless struggle.\n\nThe war has become financially unsustainable, draining our economy while neglecting pressing domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Billions are being spent on a conflict that has lost its original justification, sacrificing our own citizens' well-being in a foreign land. It's time to prioritize our own needs and end this war.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of online privacy, particularly regarding platforms like Myspace. They argue that posting information online means accepting that it can be seen by others, especially if it's on a platform where users can be friends. However, they also acknowledge the potential dangers of strangers accessing personal information and the discomfort that can arise from this. The speaker provides an example of a news story where a man used information from a girl's profile to contact her and arrange a meeting, highlighting the risks involved. They also mention the difficulty of balancing privacy with the desire to connect with friends online. The speaker concludes by questioning the authority of high schools to ban students from using Myspace, raising concerns about the extent to which schools can regulate students' online activities.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, citing widespread global, Iraqi, and even U.S. troop disapproval. They argue that the war has been a disaster from the start and that pulling out, while also difficult, is the best course of action. The speaker criticizes the U.S. administration's attempts to impose democracy in a region where it may not be suitable and emphasizes the cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East. While acknowledging Saddam Hussein's negative actions, the speaker stresses the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading a country. They believe that the U.S. should leave Iraq, possibly over a year, and defer to the Iraqi people's wishes, even if it means facing potential consequences. They concede that the U.S. may never be seen as \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but leaving would be an improvement over the current situation.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, affecting not just women but also men depending on their chosen field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering difficulty advancing in their careers despite qualifications, due to societal biases that associate leadership positions with men.  \n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children face societal stigma, as traditional expectations often dictate that men should be breadwinners. The fashion industry presents another example, where male designers might be questioned about their credibility due to preconceived notions about fashion being a predominantly female domain.\n\nChange is gradual, but positive shifts are occurring as women assume leadership roles and stay-at-home dads become more accepted. It's crucial to challenge stereotypes and highlight the strengths of individuals, rather than forcing change, allowing for a natural evolution of societal norms.",
            "The speaker explains that marijuana has been decriminalized, meaning it's treated more like a traffic violation than a serious crime. This reduces the legal consequences for those caught with it, such as avoiding arrest and court appearances. However, the speaker acknowledges that decriminalization doesn't completely eliminate the social stigma associated with marijuana use, which can still impact job opportunities and other aspects of life.\n\nThe speaker then discusses the financial arguments for decriminalization. They argue that the costs associated with arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals for marijuana possession are substantial. Decriminalization, they suggest, could free up these resources for other community needs like education, social programs, and services for the homeless.  \n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities remain opposed to marijuana use, even if it saves money. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, they believe decriminalization is acceptable and beneficial.\n\nFinally, the speaker contrasts decriminalization with full legalization, expressing concerns about the potential negative consequences of widespread marijuana availability, such as increased public smoking and driving under the influence. They also highlight the social stigma surrounding marijuana use, suggesting that open availability could lead to awkwardness and discomfort for many. \n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the varying effects of both marijuana and alcohol, noting that individual reactions to substances differ greatly. They acknowledge the adverse effects of both drugs but ultimately believe that people's personalities and choices play a significant role in how they are affected.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While tradition is important, it's also crucial to adapt to evolving times.  I feel the Church can be too rigid in its doctrines and practices, sometimes seeming judgmental towards those who don't perfectly adhere to them or those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents were denied marriage in the Catholic Church because my father wasn't Catholic. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, making it seem hypocritical.  I believe the Church's teachings often clash with its practices, particularly when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nRegarding allowing priests to marry, I think it could be a positive step, but it wouldn't necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. These are separate issues, and a priest's marital status wouldn't change their inherent predisposition to harm children.",
            "I'm still unsure about this issue and can't say definitively which side is right or wrong.  However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today.  \n\nIt's a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage.  It's difficult to address this without causing offense. \n\nI think civil unions might be a better approach.  Perhaps marriage should be viewed as a civil contract rather than a religious sacrament defined by the government.  After all, the government doesn't offer tax benefits or special treatment based on religious beliefs like baptism.  \n\nIf someone is married, the government should simply recognize it as a civil union. It's about two people uniting, regardless of their religious views.\n\nIdeally, if states can come to a reasonable consensus, they should push for federal legislation.  \n\nHowever, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is unnecessary and overreaching. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't significant enough to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is complex for me. While I have many gay friends and don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by individual states.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings. Democrat-led states are more likely to support gay marriage, and I believe residents of those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and allowing states to decide on marriage equality is the most equitable solution. I disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage because it doesn't reflect the diverse views across the country.  \n\nWith a potential change in presidency in a couple of years, this issue will likely remain a back-and-forth battle. It's more sensible to leave the decision to individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials have the right to access student profiles. They argue that students should understand that anything posted online is visible to others, including school authorities. While they acknowledge that schools shouldn't specifically monitor students' online activity to catch them breaking rules, they believe it's acceptable if officials stumble upon concerning information that could prevent harm or improve school safety. The speaker draws parallels to school safety drills and security measures implemented after the Columbine shooting, emphasizing the importance of creating a safe learning environment. They ultimately conclude that if school officials' actions contribute to preventing tragedies like Columbine, it's justified, even if it involves accessing student's online presence.",
            "Initially, I strongly supported the war in Iraq because 9/11 deeply affected me personally. I wanted revenge for the attacks. However, I now regret that emotional response.\n\nI believe our actions were hasty and ill-prepared. We lacked a clear plan and didn't consider the long-term consequences.  I don't believe our presence is helpful as the Iraqi people are too divided amongst themselves.\n\nThe war has been devastating for both sides. We entered seeking revenge, and I feel our actions have only fueled more violence. The Iraqi people are caught in a cycle of conflict, and I'm not sure we have the capacity to change that. \n\nI think we need to acknowledge that our intervention hasn't been successful and that it's time to leave. Staying only prolongs the suffering and does more harm than good."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views on several issues to retain its followers. They cite instances like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, arguing that the Church's stance on these topics is outdated and alienating people. The speaker suggests that a more modern approach might help the Church avoid losing members, as some are already distancing themselves due to disagreements with the Church's positions. They also question the necessity of celibacy for priests, pointing out that other professions allow for both work and family life.",
            "I'm not against same-sex marriage. I believe sexual orientation is innate, not a choice, so people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow marriage between a man and a woman but deny it to same-sex couples.  Although I haven't deeply considered this issue, it feels wrong to restrict someone's right to marry based on their sexual orientation.  \n\nI don't think the government should interfere in this personal matter. It's not a national security issue or a moral dilemma; it's a personal choice that shouldn't be regulated.  The government shouldn't dictate who people can marry, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and commitment.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there isn't a valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but these relationships are diverse and unique, like two sides of the same coin. \n\nGay couples deserve the same civil rights as heterosexual couples, including healthcare access and property rights. For instance, if one partner is sick, the other can't be present or make medical decisions without legal recognition.  \n\nScientific studies show that gay couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. They seek legal recognition, not religious sanction. It's comparable to legalizing civil unions but denying marriage – a form of segregation.\n\nConcerns arise regarding adoption and societal impact. However, children raised by gay parents adjust well and exhibit similar behaviors.  \n\nSome oppose gay marriage based on religious beliefs or the misconception that homosexuality stems from psychological trauma. These viewpoints are unsubstantiated and contradict findings by reputable organizations like the American Psychological Association.\n\nUltimately, the government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.",
            "Working in a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that a drug's legality doesn't determine its medical value. While I believe making marijuana readily available to the public is a bad idea, I support its use for medicinal purposes. Many illegal drugs, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are used in pharmacies because they provide benefits. Denying those benefits simply because of societal stigma around marijuana is illogical. We should acknowledge its potential therapeutic properties.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is complex. Both can be abused, leading to negative consequences. However, I think a gradual approach to legalization, removing the taboo surrounding marijuana first, could encourage responsible use. This would allow people to see it as a potentially beneficial substance rather than a dangerous one.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and if we shift public perception, people may use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes that the Catholic church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe a shift from formal attire to casual clothing, even at traditional Sunday masses.  The speaker feels this casualization is a positive change, reflecting a move towards greater accessibility.\n\nWhen asked about the Catholic Church's handling of priest sexual abuse scandals, the speaker expresses doubt that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. They argue that pedophilia is a complex issue rooted in individual genetics rather than social factors like celibacy. \n\nThe speaker acknowledges the church's responsibility to address abuse cases and condemns any attempts at cover-ups. However, they believe that some cases might have been genuinely unforeseen.",
            "The speaker strongly criticizes the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses. They argue that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and by claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false. The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense. They also express concern that the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11. \n\nThe speaker believes the war stemmed from a desire for revenge on Saddam Hussein, possibly fueled by the previous administration's experience, and also a desire to secure energy resources. They acknowledge the potential chaos if the US withdrew abruptly, but are skeptical about the proposed alternative of a coalition of neighboring nations intervening.  \n\nThe speaker worries that this would further undermine Iraq's sovereignty and exacerbate political instability. They point to the ineffective Iraqi parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the influence of factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party as evidence of the country's fragile political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses confusion and uncertainty about the War in Iraq, acknowledging that it wasn't officially declared by Congress. They believe it was primarily a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose. They argue that staying in Iraq to establish democracy is a lengthy and potentially futile endeavor, potentially leading to resentment from Iraqis if the U.S. withdraws. The speaker also expresses concern about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. They acknowledge the hardships faced by families with loved ones serving in Iraq but ultimately believe that the U.S. presence exacerbates cultural tensions and fuels resentment, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict.",
            "I strongly believe it's inappropriate for the government, specifically a state, to legalize or criminalize this issue.  The Constitution's separation of church and state clearly delineates this boundary.  Attempting to impose any legal restrictions on this topic would directly contradict the Constitution's principles.  \n\nThose advocating for its criminalization are essentially imposing the beliefs of one religious group over others. While many Catholics and Christians oppose it, it's not the government's role to dictate what religions can and cannot deem legal or illegal.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, ensuring religious tolerance in the United States. Even considering an amendment on this issue would be wrong and contradictory to existing constitutional principles.  Moreover, it would likely be one of the few amendments designed to restrict individual rights rather than government power. \n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government, should not be involved in this matter. The push for an amendment appears to stem from personal religious beliefs rather than broader societal concerns. This preference for one religion over others is concerning.\n\nUltimately, the decision should rest with individual churches, not with politicians or the government. There's no compelling reason to support an amendment banning this practice, as it's unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy or society in a negative way.  It could even potentially have a positive effect.",
            "The speaker believes the U.S. government was not entirely honest with the public about the reasons for the Iraq War, misleadingly linking it to the 9/11 attacks to manipulate public sentiment in favor of invasion. They strongly oppose preemptive war and see the conflict as reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the U.S. government failing to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThe speaker criticizes the U.S. intervention, arguing that the government was unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government and creating a power vacuum. They point to the high number of American casualties and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable democratic government in Iraq, comparing it to the lengthy and difficult process of establishing democracy in the United States itself.\n\nThey express a sense of moral obligation to see the situation through, but also acknowledge the significant human cost involved. The speaker questions the government's motives, suggesting that oil resources and control play a role in the war, and criticizes the lack of transparency and consistency in U.S. foreign policy, citing the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the inaction regarding North Korea's known possession of such weapons.\n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses hope for peace and a swift end to the conflict, but remains skeptical.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference, increasingly supported by evidence suggesting a biological basis rather than a sociological one. Denying people rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, household issue, not a matter for state or federal legislation.  I live in a neighborhood with several openly gay couples who function like any other family, raising dogs, walking the streets, and living their lives. It's absurd for politicians like Bush to attempt to define marriage according to their own interpretation.\n\nResearch indicates that homosexuality may have a biological basis, potentially linked to brain chemistry. It's not a choice, but rather a predisposition.  \n\nThe double standard is clear: a heterosexual couple can marry privately without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to marry becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal matter, not a subject for public or national debate.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public information accessible to everyone.  This means your posts can influence how people perceive you.  If you share content about violence or harmful actions, someone is likely to notice and take action. Schools, for instance, can't ignore threats or concerning posts, even if they seem like jokes.  They have a responsibility to investigate and ensure student safety.\n\nWhile it's important to take online threats seriously, it's also crucial to remember that not everything online is malicious.  Sometimes posts can be misinterpreted or taken out of context.  \n\nHowever, there's no true \"privacy\" on the internet. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your words or what they choose to share.\n\nSchool officials should not actively monitor students' social media profiles, but if concerns are raised by someone who has access to the information, they have a duty to investigate.  It's important to distinguish between monitoring and responding to specific concerns brought to their attention.",
            "I believe the war has dragged on for far too long. While the initial goal was noble – restoring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system – I feel we've lost sight of that purpose. It now seems like we're fighting merely to assert our dominance as a superpower. Additionally, the war's origins might have been tainted by personal vendettas, stemming from disagreements between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the goal was truly to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal motives played a role, it wouldn't be fair. Regardless, the war has clearly overstayed its welcome.\n\nThe initial invasion served its purpose as a statement of power, but prolonging the conflict for years has become counterproductive. We need a decisive end, either victory or withdrawal, rather than this endless struggle.\n\nThe war has become financially unsustainable, draining our economy while neglecting pressing domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Billions are being spent on a conflict that has lost its original justification, sacrificing our own citizens' well-being in a foreign land. It's time to prioritize our own needs and end this war.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of online privacy, particularly regarding platforms like Myspace. They argue that posting information online means accepting that it can be seen by others, especially if it's on a platform where users can be friends. However, they also acknowledge the potential dangers of strangers accessing personal information and the discomfort that can arise from this. The speaker provides an example of a news story where a man used information from a girl's profile to contact her and arrange a meeting, highlighting the risks involved. They also mention the difficulty of balancing privacy with the desire to connect with friends online. The speaker concludes by questioning the authority of high schools to ban students from using Myspace, raising concerns about the extent to which schools can regulate students' online activities.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, citing widespread global, Iraqi, and even U.S. troop disapproval. They argue that the war has been a disaster from the start and that pulling out, while also difficult, is the best course of action. The speaker criticizes the U.S. administration's attempts to impose democracy in a region where it may not be suitable and emphasizes the cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East. While acknowledging Saddam Hussein's negative actions, the speaker stresses the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading a country. They believe that the U.S. should leave Iraq, possibly over a year, and defer to the Iraqi people's wishes, even if it means facing potential consequences. They concede that the U.S. may never be seen as \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but leaving would be an improvement over the current situation.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, affecting not just women but also men depending on their chosen field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering difficulty advancing in their careers despite qualifications, due to societal biases that associate leadership positions with men.  \n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children face societal stigma, as traditional expectations often dictate that men should be breadwinners. The fashion industry presents another example, where male designers might be questioned about their credibility due to preconceived notions about fashion being a predominantly female domain.\n\nChange is gradual, but positive shifts are occurring as women assume leadership roles and stay-at-home dads become more accepted. It's crucial to challenge stereotypes and highlight the strengths of individuals, rather than forcing change, allowing for a natural evolution of societal norms.",
            "The speaker explains that marijuana has been decriminalized, meaning it's treated more like a traffic violation than a serious crime. This reduces the legal consequences for those caught with it, such as avoiding arrest and court appearances. However, the speaker acknowledges that decriminalization doesn't completely eliminate the social stigma associated with marijuana use, which can still impact job opportunities and other aspects of life.\n\nThe speaker then discusses the financial arguments for decriminalization. They argue that the costs associated with arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals for marijuana possession are substantial. Decriminalization, they suggest, could free up these resources for other community needs like education, social programs, and services for the homeless.  \n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities remain opposed to marijuana use, even if it saves money. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, they believe decriminalization is acceptable and beneficial.\n\nFinally, the speaker contrasts decriminalization with full legalization, expressing concerns about the potential negative consequences of widespread marijuana availability, such as increased public smoking and driving under the influence. They also highlight the social stigma surrounding marijuana use, suggesting that open availability could lead to awkwardness and discomfort for many. \n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the varying effects of both marijuana and alcohol, noting that individual reactions to substances differ greatly. They acknowledge the adverse effects of both drugs but ultimately believe that people's personalities and choices play a significant role in how they are affected.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While tradition is important, it's also crucial to adapt to evolving times.  I feel the Church can be too rigid in its doctrines and practices, sometimes seeming judgmental towards those who don't perfectly adhere to them or those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents were denied marriage in the Catholic Church because my father wasn't Catholic. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, making it seem hypocritical.  I believe the Church's teachings often clash with its practices, particularly when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nRegarding allowing priests to marry, I think it could be a positive step, but it wouldn't necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. These are separate issues, and a priest's marital status wouldn't change their inherent predisposition to harm children.",
            "I'm still unsure about this issue and can't say definitively which side is right or wrong.  However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today.  \n\nIt's a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage.  It's difficult to address this without causing offense. \n\nI think civil unions might be a better approach.  Perhaps marriage should be viewed as a civil contract rather than a religious sacrament defined by the government.  After all, the government doesn't offer tax benefits or special treatment based on religious beliefs like baptism.  \n\nIf someone is married, the government should simply recognize it as a civil union. It's about two people uniting, regardless of their religious views.\n\nIdeally, if states can come to a reasonable consensus, they should push for federal legislation.  \n\nHowever, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is unnecessary and overreaching. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't significant enough to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is complex for me. While I have many gay friends and don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by individual states.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings. Democrat-led states are more likely to support gay marriage, and I believe residents of those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and allowing states to decide on marriage equality is the most equitable solution. I disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage because it doesn't reflect the diverse views across the country.  \n\nWith a potential change in presidency in a couple of years, this issue will likely remain a back-and-forth battle. It's more sensible to leave the decision to individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials have the right to access student profiles. They argue that students should understand that anything posted online is visible to others, including school authorities. While they acknowledge that schools shouldn't specifically monitor students' online activity to catch them breaking rules, they believe it's acceptable if officials stumble upon concerning information that could prevent harm or improve school safety. The speaker draws parallels to school safety drills and security measures implemented after the Columbine shooting, emphasizing the importance of creating a safe learning environment. They ultimately conclude that if school officials' actions contribute to preventing tragedies like Columbine, it's justified, even if it involves accessing student's online presence.",
            "Initially, I strongly supported the war in Iraq because 9/11 deeply affected me personally. I wanted revenge for the attacks. However, I now regret that emotional response.\n\nI believe our actions were hasty and ill-prepared. We lacked a clear plan and didn't consider the long-term consequences.  I don't believe our presence is helpful as the Iraqi people are too divided amongst themselves.\n\nThe war has been devastating for both sides. We entered seeking revenge, and I feel our actions have only fueled more violence. The Iraqi people are caught in a cycle of conflict, and I'm not sure we have the capacity to change that. \n\nI think we need to acknowledge that our intervention hasn't been successful and that it's time to leave. Staying only prolongs the suffering and does more harm than good."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views on several issues to retain its followers. They cite instances like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, arguing that the Church's stance on these topics is outdated and alienating people. The speaker suggests that a more modern approach might help the Church avoid losing members, as some are already distancing themselves due to disagreements with the Church's positions. They also question the necessity of celibacy for priests, pointing out that other professions allow for both work and family life.",
            "I'm not against same-sex marriage. I believe sexual orientation is innate, not a choice, so people shouldn't be blamed for who they are attracted to. It seems unfair to allow marriage between a man and a woman but deny it to same-sex couples.  Although I haven't deeply considered this issue, it feels wrong to restrict someone's right to marry based on their sexual orientation.  \n\nI don't think the government should interfere in this personal matter. It's not a national security issue or a moral dilemma; it's a personal choice that shouldn't be regulated.  The government shouldn't dictate who people can marry, especially when it comes to something as fundamental as love and commitment.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there isn't a valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but these relationships are diverse and unique, like two sides of the same coin. \n\nGay couples deserve the same civil rights as heterosexual couples, including healthcare access and property rights. For instance, if one partner is sick, the other can't be present or make medical decisions without legal recognition.  \n\nScientific studies show that gay couples have similar relationship dynamics and success rates as heterosexual couples. They seek legal recognition, not religious sanction. It's comparable to legalizing civil unions but denying marriage – a form of segregation.\n\nConcerns arise regarding adoption and societal impact. However, children raised by gay parents adjust well and exhibit similar behaviors.  \n\nSome oppose gay marriage based on religious beliefs or the misconception that homosexuality stems from psychological trauma. These viewpoints are unsubstantiated and contradict findings by reputable organizations like the American Psychological Association.\n\nUltimately, the government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation.",
            "Working in a hospital pharmacy, I've learned that a drug's legality doesn't determine its medical value. While I believe making marijuana readily available to the public is a bad idea, I support its use for medicinal purposes. Many illegal drugs, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are used in pharmacies because they provide benefits. Denying those benefits simply because of societal stigma around marijuana is illogical. We should acknowledge its potential therapeutic properties.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is complex. Both can be abused, leading to negative consequences. However, I think a gradual approach to legalization, removing the taboo surrounding marijuana first, could encourage responsible use. This would allow people to see it as a potentially beneficial substance rather than a dangerous one.\n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and if we shift public perception, people may use it responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes that the Catholic church has become more relaxed in the 21st century, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe a shift from formal attire to casual clothing, even at traditional Sunday masses.  The speaker feels this casualization is a positive change, reflecting a move towards greater accessibility.\n\nWhen asked about the Catholic Church's handling of priest sexual abuse scandals, the speaker expresses doubt that allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented these incidents. They argue that pedophilia is a complex issue rooted in individual genetics rather than social factors like celibacy. \n\nThe speaker acknowledges the church's responsibility to address abuse cases and condemns any attempts at cover-ups. However, they believe that some cases might have been genuinely unforeseen.",
            "The speaker strongly criticizes the Iraq War, believing it was based on false pretenses. They argue that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and 9/11, and by claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction, which have since been proven false. The speaker views this as a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense. They also express concern that the Bush administration has shown disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11. \n\nThe speaker believes the war stemmed from a desire for revenge on Saddam Hussein, possibly fueled by the previous administration's experience, and also a desire to secure energy resources. They acknowledge the potential chaos if the US withdrew abruptly, but are skeptical about the proposed alternative of a coalition of neighboring nations intervening.  \n\nThe speaker worries that this would further undermine Iraq's sovereignty and exacerbate political instability. They point to the ineffective Iraqi parliament, the lack of control by the Prime Minister, and the influence of factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party as evidence of the country's fragile political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses confusion and uncertainty about the War in Iraq, acknowledging that it wasn't officially declared by Congress. They believe it was primarily a retaliatory measure against Iraq for the 9/11 attacks and question its continued purpose. They argue that staying in Iraq to establish democracy is a lengthy and potentially futile endeavor, potentially leading to resentment from Iraqis if the U.S. withdraws. The speaker also expresses concern about the war's impact on President Bush's legacy, comparing it to the Vietnam War. They acknowledge the hardships faced by families with loved ones serving in Iraq but ultimately believe that the U.S. presence exacerbates cultural tensions and fuels resentment, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict.",
            "I strongly believe it's inappropriate for the government, specifically a state, to legalize or criminalize this issue.  The Constitution's separation of church and state clearly delineates this boundary.  Attempting to impose any legal restrictions on this topic would directly contradict the Constitution's principles.  \n\nThose advocating for its criminalization are essentially imposing the beliefs of one religious group over others. While many Catholics and Christians oppose it, it's not the government's role to dictate what religions can and cannot deem legal or illegal.  \n\nSeparation of church and state is a fundamental aspect of the Constitution, ensuring religious tolerance in the United States. Even considering an amendment on this issue would be wrong and contradictory to existing constitutional principles.  Moreover, it would likely be one of the few amendments designed to restrict individual rights rather than government power. \n\nI firmly believe the federal government, or any government, should not be involved in this matter. The push for an amendment appears to stem from personal religious beliefs rather than broader societal concerns. This preference for one religion over others is concerning.\n\nUltimately, the decision should rest with individual churches, not with politicians or the government. There's no compelling reason to support an amendment banning this practice, as it's unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy or society in a negative way.  It could even potentially have a positive effect.",
            "The speaker believes the U.S. government was not entirely honest with the public about the reasons for the Iraq War, misleadingly linking it to the 9/11 attacks to manipulate public sentiment in favor of invasion. They strongly oppose preemptive war and see the conflict as reminiscent of the Vietnam War, with the U.S. government failing to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThe speaker criticizes the U.S. intervention, arguing that the government was unprepared for the consequences of removing the Iraqi government and creating a power vacuum. They point to the high number of American casualties and the ongoing struggle to establish a stable democratic government in Iraq, comparing it to the lengthy and difficult process of establishing democracy in the United States itself.\n\nThey express a sense of moral obligation to see the situation through, but also acknowledge the significant human cost involved. The speaker questions the government's motives, suggesting that oil resources and control play a role in the war, and criticizes the lack of transparency and consistency in U.S. foreign policy, citing the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the inaction regarding North Korea's known possession of such weapons.\n\nUltimately, the speaker expresses hope for peace and a swift end to the conflict, but remains skeptical.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal preference, increasingly supported by evidence suggesting a biological basis rather than a sociological one. Denying people rights based on something beyond their control is inhumane. I've been an advocate for gay marriage for a long time.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, household issue, not a matter for state or federal legislation.  I live in a neighborhood with several openly gay couples who function like any other family, raising dogs, walking the streets, and living their lives. It's absurd for politicians like Bush to attempt to define marriage according to their own interpretation.\n\nResearch indicates that homosexuality may have a biological basis, potentially linked to brain chemistry. It's not a choice, but rather a predisposition.  \n\nThe double standard is clear: a heterosexual couple can marry privately without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to marry becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal matter, not a subject for public or national debate.",
            "When you post something online, it becomes public information accessible to everyone.  This means your posts can influence how people perceive you.  If you share content about violence or harmful actions, someone is likely to notice and take action. Schools, for instance, can't ignore threats or concerning posts, even if they seem like jokes.  They have a responsibility to investigate and ensure student safety.\n\nWhile it's important to take online threats seriously, it's also crucial to remember that not everything online is malicious.  Sometimes posts can be misinterpreted or taken out of context.  \n\nHowever, there's no true \"privacy\" on the internet. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your words or what they choose to share.\n\nSchool officials should not actively monitor students' social media profiles, but if concerns are raised by someone who has access to the information, they have a duty to investigate.  It's important to distinguish between monitoring and responding to specific concerns brought to their attention.",
            "I believe the war has dragged on for far too long. While the initial goal was noble – restoring democracy to a country lacking a fair political system – I feel we've lost sight of that purpose. It now seems like we're fighting merely to assert our dominance as a superpower. Additionally, the war's origins might have been tainted by personal vendettas, stemming from disagreements between George Bush Sr. and Saddam Hussein.\n\nIf the goal was truly to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for the war. However, if personal motives played a role, it wouldn't be fair. Regardless, the war has clearly overstayed its welcome.\n\nThe initial invasion served its purpose as a statement of power, but prolonging the conflict for years has become counterproductive. We need a decisive end, either victory or withdrawal, rather than this endless struggle.\n\nThe war has become financially unsustainable, draining our economy while neglecting pressing domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, healthcare, and education. Billions are being spent on a conflict that has lost its original justification, sacrificing our own citizens' well-being in a foreign land. It's time to prioritize our own needs and end this war.",
            "The speaker discusses the ethical implications of online privacy, particularly regarding platforms like Myspace. They argue that posting information online means accepting that it can be seen by others, especially if it's on a platform where users can be friends. However, they also acknowledge the potential dangers of strangers accessing personal information and the discomfort that can arise from this. The speaker provides an example of a news story where a man used information from a girl's profile to contact her and arrange a meeting, highlighting the risks involved. They also mention the difficulty of balancing privacy with the desire to connect with friends online. The speaker concludes by questioning the authority of high schools to ban students from using Myspace, raising concerns about the extent to which schools can regulate students' online activities.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake, citing widespread global, Iraqi, and even U.S. troop disapproval. They argue that the war has been a disaster from the start and that pulling out, while also difficult, is the best course of action. The speaker criticizes the U.S. administration's attempts to impose democracy in a region where it may not be suitable and emphasizes the cultural differences between the U.S. and the Middle East. While acknowledging Saddam Hussein's negative actions, the speaker stresses the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading a country. They believe that the U.S. should leave Iraq, possibly over a year, and defer to the Iraqi people's wishes, even if it means facing potential consequences. They concede that the U.S. may never be seen as \"good guys\" in the Middle East, but leaving would be an improvement over the current situation.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination remains an issue in the United States, affecting not just women but also men depending on their chosen field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering difficulty advancing in their careers despite qualifications, due to societal biases that associate leadership positions with men.  \n\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children face societal stigma, as traditional expectations often dictate that men should be breadwinners. The fashion industry presents another example, where male designers might be questioned about their credibility due to preconceived notions about fashion being a predominantly female domain.\n\nChange is gradual, but positive shifts are occurring as women assume leadership roles and stay-at-home dads become more accepted. It's crucial to challenge stereotypes and highlight the strengths of individuals, rather than forcing change, allowing for a natural evolution of societal norms.",
            "The speaker explains that marijuana has been decriminalized, meaning it's treated more like a traffic violation than a serious crime. This reduces the legal consequences for those caught with it, such as avoiding arrest and court appearances. However, the speaker acknowledges that decriminalization doesn't completely eliminate the social stigma associated with marijuana use, which can still impact job opportunities and other aspects of life.\n\nThe speaker then discusses the financial arguments for decriminalization. They argue that the costs associated with arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals for marijuana possession are substantial. Decriminalization, they suggest, could free up these resources for other community needs like education, social programs, and services for the homeless.  \n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities remain opposed to marijuana use, even if it saves money. However, in more liberal areas like Denver, they believe decriminalization is acceptable and beneficial.\n\nFinally, the speaker contrasts decriminalization with full legalization, expressing concerns about the potential negative consequences of widespread marijuana availability, such as increased public smoking and driving under the influence. They also highlight the social stigma surrounding marijuana use, suggesting that open availability could lead to awkwardness and discomfort for many. \n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the varying effects of both marijuana and alcohol, noting that individual reactions to substances differ greatly. They acknowledge the adverse effects of both drugs but ultimately believe that people's personalities and choices play a significant role in how they are affected.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church could benefit from some changes. While tradition is important, it's also crucial to adapt to evolving times.  I feel the Church can be too rigid in its doctrines and practices, sometimes seeming judgmental towards those who don't perfectly adhere to them or those from different religious backgrounds. For example, my parents were denied marriage in the Catholic Church because my father wasn't Catholic. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, making it seem hypocritical.  I believe the Church's teachings often clash with its practices, particularly when it comes to outdated rules.\n\nRegarding allowing priests to marry, I think it could be a positive step, but it wouldn't necessarily prevent instances of child abuse. These are separate issues, and a priest's marital status wouldn't change their inherent predisposition to harm children.",
            "I'm still unsure about this issue and can't say definitively which side is right or wrong.  However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today.  \n\nIt's a delicate balance between separating church and state and defining marriage.  It's difficult to address this without causing offense. \n\nI think civil unions might be a better approach.  Perhaps marriage should be viewed as a civil contract rather than a religious sacrament defined by the government.  After all, the government doesn't offer tax benefits or special treatment based on religious beliefs like baptism.  \n\nIf someone is married, the government should simply recognize it as a civil union. It's about two people uniting, regardless of their religious views.\n\nIdeally, if states can come to a reasonable consensus, they should push for federal legislation.  \n\nHowever, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is unnecessary and overreaching. The constitution shouldn't be amended for something that, while important to some, isn't significant enough to warrant such a drastic change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, the topic of homosexuality is complex for me. While I have many gay friends and don't necessarily condone the lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue, but rather something decided by individual states.  \n\nDifferent states have different political leanings. Democrat-led states are more likely to support gay marriage, and I believe residents of those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I think homosexuals deserve the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and allowing states to decide on marriage equality is the most equitable solution. I disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage because it doesn't reflect the diverse views across the country.  \n\nWith a potential change in presidency in a couple of years, this issue will likely remain a back-and-forth battle. It's more sensible to leave the decision to individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately live with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that since Myspace is a public platform, school officials have the right to access student profiles. They argue that students should understand that anything posted online is visible to others, including school authorities. While they acknowledge that schools shouldn't specifically monitor students' online activity to catch them breaking rules, they believe it's acceptable if officials stumble upon concerning information that could prevent harm or improve school safety. The speaker draws parallels to school safety drills and security measures implemented after the Columbine shooting, emphasizing the importance of creating a safe learning environment. They ultimately conclude that if school officials' actions contribute to preventing tragedies like Columbine, it's justified, even if it involves accessing student's online presence.",
            "Initially, I strongly supported the war in Iraq because 9/11 deeply affected me personally. I wanted revenge for the attacks. However, I now regret that emotional response.\n\nI believe our actions were hasty and ill-prepared. We lacked a clear plan and didn't consider the long-term consequences.  I don't believe our presence is helpful as the Iraqi people are too divided amongst themselves.\n\nThe war has been devastating for both sides. We entered seeking revenge, and I feel our actions have only fueled more violence. The Iraqi people are caught in a cycle of conflict, and I'm not sure we have the capacity to change that. \n\nI think we need to acknowledge that our intervention hasn't been successful and that it's time to leave. Staying only prolongs the suffering and does more harm than good."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, as its stance on these matters is considered outdated by some.  They feel these strict views contribute to the decline in the Church's following, as people who hold different beliefs may feel unwelcome. The speaker uses examples like abortion and gay marriage to illustrate how individuals who support these rights might find it difficult to align with the Church's teachings. They also question the logic of priests being \"married to God\" while being unable to have families, suggesting that priests could benefit from having both a religious and a personal life.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they're attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but not same-sex couples. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue as it's a matter of personal freedom and doesn't affect national security or morality. It simply feels like an intrusion into people's lives to dictate who they can marry.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legal because there's no valid reason to oppose it.  Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but this comparison is flawed.  \n\nMany civil rights are tied to marriage, including healthcare and property ownership. For example, a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be present in a hospital room or make medical decisions if the other is ill because they aren't legally recognized as family.  \n\nNumerous studies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and factors contributing to happiness as heterosexual relationships. \n\nAdvocates for gay marriage are not seeking religious approval; they simply want a legal document from the government.  \n\nThe argument that religious beliefs should dictate law is problematic, as it would infringe on the rights of those who hold different beliefs.\n\nConcerns exist about adoption and the impact of gay families on society, but these fears are largely unfounded. Gay parents provide loving homes, and children raised by same-sex couples fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples. \n\nThe argument that homosexuality is a psychological defect is also disproven by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has clearly stated this.  It's important to rely on research and facts rather than prejudice and misinformation. \n\nI strongly believe the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand that a drug's legality doesn't determine its medicinal value.  While I believe marijuana shouldn't be widely available to the public, I support its use for medical purposes. Many controlled substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are legal for medical use despite their potential for abuse.  The same logic applies to marijuana - its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply because of its illegal status.\n\nI understand the concerns about marijuana abuse, but I think gradual legalization, coupled with education to remove the stigma surrounding it, could lead to responsible use. It's not as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine, and its negative image is largely fueled by its illegality. If we change public perception, people might be more likely to use marijuana responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more casual in recent times, with less emphasis on formal attire and shorter services, especially for teenagers. They note that people now attend mass in more comfortable clothing, even beachwear in summer.  While acknowledging the church's ongoing challenges, the speaker doesn't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia. They argue that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and that marriage wouldn't necessarily change an individual's predisposition.",
            "I initially supported the idea of the Iraq War, but the events of 9/11 heavily influenced the public's perception. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction, claims that were later proven false. This manipulation of information deeply troubled me and evokes strong negative feelings towards the war. \n\nI believe the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people, and their actions constitute malfeasance in office. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted his doubts about its validity. To me, this level of deception towards the public is a serious offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, particularly after 9/11. \n\nThere's a strong suspicion that the Bush administration entered office with a pre-conceived plan to go to war, possibly fueled by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's administration and a desire to secure energy resources.\n\nWhile the war needs to end, an immediate withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution involves a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order in Iraq. However, this approach raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and potential future instability. \n\nThe current Iraqi government is struggling, with a weak parliament and a Prime Minister lacking effective control.  Political factions, including those led by figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, creating a volatile and unstable environment.",
            "The speaker expresses mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They believe it was an unjustified response to the 9/11 attacks, driven by a desire for revenge and resource control.  They question the effectiveness of staying in Iraq to build democracy, arguing that it's a lengthy process that could lead to resentment and instability if the U.S. withdraws. The speaker also acknowledges the human cost of the war, mentioning families with loved ones in Iraq and the destruction caused by the conflict. Ultimately, they believe the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, fueling hatred towards the U.S. and exacerbating the situation in Iraq.",
            "The speaker strongly opposes government involvement in regulating religious practices, believing it violates the principle of separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempts to legislate on this issue amount to favoring one religious viewpoint over others, particularly as many Catholics and Christians oppose the practice in question.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any amendment aimed at banning the practice would be contradictory to the Constitution's core values of religious tolerance and would uniquely restrict individual liberties rather than government power. They believe the decision should remain with individual churches, not with the government, as there are no compelling reasons, such as economic impact, to justify such an amendment.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, believing the government misled the American public about its justification. They argue that the invasion was linked to the September 11th terrorist attacks to exploit public outrage, despite little connection between the two events. The speaker views the war as a repetition of the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThey criticize the lack of preparation for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and instability. The speaker compares the situation to Vietnam, where the US attempted to impose democracy, facing resistance from insurgents. They emphasize that fighting a war against a populace rather than a formal army is incredibly difficult.\n\nThe speaker believes the US should have thoroughly planned for all potential outcomes before engaging in war and criticizes the government for underestimating the complexity of establishing a new government. They feel the US government misled the public about the war's duration and success, suggesting naivete on the part of Americans who believed in a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges the moral dilemma of abandoning Iraq after removing its government but also highlights the substantial American casualties and questions the cost of pursuing a free democratic Iraq. They question the US's selective approach to democracy promotion, citing the lack of intervention in North Korea despite their known weapons of mass destruction, suggesting the influence of oil interests.\n\nFinally, the speaker expresses hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its immediate realization.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it may have biological roots rather than sociological ones. Denying people rights based on something beyond their control feels inhumane.\n\nI believe politics and government shouldn't interfere in this deeply personal matter. It's about individual families, not a matter for the state.  I see loving gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, raising their children and participating in the community. It's frustrating that they can't legally marry because of political interference, particularly when someone like President Bush tries to impose his personal interpretation of marriage.\n\nScientific evidence suggests that homosexuality may be biologically predetermined, not a choice influenced by upbringing or environment. This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe discrepancy in how society treats heterosexual and homosexual relationships is glaring. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without fanfare, while gay couples face public scrutiny and legal battles. Marriage should be a private matter, not subject to national or federal legislation.",
            "Sharing information online is like putting it in a public square; everyone can see it.  Anything you post, especially concerning violence, can shape others' perceptions of you. If someone sees a disturbing post, they might report it to the authorities, even if it was intended as a joke. Schools have a responsibility to take such reports seriously to ensure student safety. However, it's a delicate balance because not everything online is a genuine threat. Sometimes, it might be an innocent experiment or a misunderstanding.  \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that there's no real privacy online. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it.  They also express concerns about school officials excessively monitoring students' social media profiles, comparing it to invading their privacy. They believe that if information is brought to the school's attention, they must investigate, but teachers shouldn't proactively monitor students' online activities.  The speaker uses the example of not wanting to be friends with their residents on social media because they don't want to be privy to their personal lives.",
            "I believe the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, I feel we've strayed from that purpose. It now seems like we're fighting simply to assert our dominance as a superpower. Furthermore, I suspect the original motives were questionable, possibly stemming from personal conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the war's aim was genuinely to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems, that would have been a justifiable reason. However, if personal interests played a role, it would have been unfair. Regardless, the war has dragged on for far too long. \n\nThe initial military action might have served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged conflict feels excessive. It's as if we're fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a peaceful resolution.\n\nUltimately, I believe the war has gone on too long. It's time for the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security. We've been spending billions of dollars on this conflict, diverting resources from crucial domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure improvements, healthcare, and education. These are areas that desperately need funding. \n\nContinuing to pour money into a war that has lost its original purpose is a drain on our economy and resources.",
            "The speaker is discussing the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace. They argue that information posted online is generally accessible to the public and that users should be aware of this when sharing personal details. They acknowledge the potential dangers of online predators but also highlight the benefits of social media for communication and connection. The speaker raises the question of whether schools have the right to ban students from using platforms like Myspace, questioning the extent of their authority in this regard.",
            "I feel uncomfortable discussing the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it now.  While I personally opposed the war from the start, it's not as relevant anymore. The vast majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis and even American troops stationed there, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw.  \n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning, and pulling out will likely be difficult as well.  The cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East are too vast for any administration to understand, and attempting to impose democracy in a region that doesn't want it is futile.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, invading Iraq was a misguided decision. The negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits, and the situation has become like quicksand. I don't see a valid reason for us to remain in Iraq any longer. While the administration might have reasons for staying, I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't object.  However, I believe we should leave as soon as possible.  Polling shows that most Iraqis want us gone within the year, and they are the ones we are supposedly trying to help.\n\nPerhaps they know best. If we ask them if they want us to leave and they say yes, at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go badly after we leave, we can say we were willing to stay but they decided otherwise.  \n\nWhile we'll likely never be seen as \"good guys\" in the Middle East, leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "The speaker believes gender discrimination still exists in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their chosen field.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where societal expectations and historical biases can prevent them from achieving top positions despite their qualifications. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents often face societal disapproval and judgment. In fields like fashion, men may encounter skepticism regarding their expertise due to traditional stereotypes. \n\nWhile progress has been made, the speaker acknowledges that change is gradual.  They suggest that promoting the positive qualities of those traditionally stereotyped can help challenge these biases without being overly forceful. The speaker also points out that discrimination can extend beyond gender, encompassing factors like socioeconomic background and education level.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalization and decriminalization of marijuana. They explain that decriminalization treats marijuana possession as a minor offense, similar to a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge. While this reduces the legal consequences, it doesn't eliminate the potential for future ramifications, particularly for job applications. \n\nThe speaker argues that decriminalization can be financially beneficial for municipalities struggling with budget constraints. The cost of arresting, processing, and prosecuting marijuana possession cases is significant.  They suggest that decriminalization can free up resources for other public services, like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities may be resistant to decriminalization due to moral or philosophical objections. However, they believe that in more open-minded communities, decriminalization can be a positive step.\n\nThe speaker also raises concerns about the potential consequences of full legalization, imagining scenarios where marijuana is readily available in places like gas stations, potentially leading to increased use and instances of marijuana-impaired driving. They note that marijuana use remains socially taboo in many contexts and that widespread legalization could create discomfort.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the potential adverse effects of both alcohol and marijuana, emphasizing that everyone reacts differently to substances and that moderation is key.",
            "While I acknowledge the value of tradition within the Catholic Church, I believe its rigid adherence to outdated doctrines and practices can be problematic. For example, the Church's refusal to marry interfaith couples, like my parents, demonstrates a lack of tolerance towards other religions despite the teaching to love all.  The Church's strictness and judgmental attitude towards those who don't perfectly adhere to its doctrines can also be alienating.  \n\nThe issue of priests marrying is complex. While I support allowing priests to marry, I don't believe it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse, as the root cause lies in the perpetrator's character, not their marital status.",
            "While I haven't fully formed an opinion on this complex issue, I believe it's one of the most challenging we face today. The intersection of separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is delicate and easily polarizing. \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a more appropriate approach. Defining marriage solely as a government-sanctioned institution, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some, feels inconsistent. Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious practices like baptism, they shouldn't dictate the specific form of a marriage. \n\nUltimately, civil unions recognize the commitment between two individuals without imposing religious or governmental interpretations. If all states agree on this approach, they should strive for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\nWhile this issue is important to many, its significance doesn't warrant amending the Constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I have many gay friends and believe they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, I personally don't agree with that lifestyle.  However, I think marriage equality should be a decision made at the state level, not by the federal government.\n\nDifferent states have different political leanings – democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while republican states may not. I believe individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by their elected officials regarding issues like same-sex marriage.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage because I think it's unfair for one person to impose their views on the entire country.  States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. This issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is in the White House, so it's best to let individual states determine their own policies.",
            "The speaker believes that school officials had the right to view a student's MySpace profile because it was a public platform. They acknowledge that accessing personal information online raises privacy concerns, but argue that if it prevents harm or improves school safety, it's justifiable. They draw parallels to school security measures like lockdown drills, which are implemented to protect students from potential threats. The speaker emphasizes that while students should be cautious about what they post online, they should also understand that information on public platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. Ultimately, the speaker believes that school officials acted appropriately by monitoring student activity online to ensure a safe learning environment.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 deeply affected me personally. I felt the urge for revenge and wanted to inflict the same pain they caused us. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed rational planning. We went into the war unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired. \n\nI've become disillusioned with the conflict. I feel that as long as internal strife continues within the region, they will be less likely to pose a threat to us. Our presence doesn't seem to be making a difference, and I've lost empathy for the people there. They seem incapable of resolving their own conflicts, which makes it difficult to justify our involvement.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared for the realities of conflict in that region. Their approach to warfare is brutal and seemingly driven by a desire to push us out rather than improve their country. I believe the best course of action is to withdraw our forces. \n\nOur initial motivations were likely fueled by anger and a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out plan. I understand President Bush's position; we couldn't simply ignore the attacks. However, we lacked a clear objective and unity of purpose.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or bringing lasting peace. Their internal divisions seem too deep-rooted. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify continued involvement. Staying longer will likely only prolong the suffering and ultimately lead to a collapse once we leave. It's time for us to withdraw and focus on our own well-being."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, as its stance on these matters is considered outdated by some.  They feel these strict views contribute to the decline in the Church's following, as people who hold different beliefs may feel unwelcome. The speaker uses examples like abortion and gay marriage to illustrate how individuals who support these rights might find it difficult to align with the Church's teachings. They also question the logic of priests being \"married to God\" while being unable to have families, suggesting that priests could benefit from having both a religious and a personal life.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they're attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but not same-sex couples. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue as it's a matter of personal freedom and doesn't affect national security or morality. It simply feels like an intrusion into people's lives to dictate who they can marry.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legal because there's no valid reason to oppose it.  Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but this comparison is flawed.  \n\nMany civil rights are tied to marriage, including healthcare and property ownership. For example, a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be present in a hospital room or make medical decisions if the other is ill because they aren't legally recognized as family.  \n\nNumerous studies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and factors contributing to happiness as heterosexual relationships. \n\nAdvocates for gay marriage are not seeking religious approval; they simply want a legal document from the government.  \n\nThe argument that religious beliefs should dictate law is problematic, as it would infringe on the rights of those who hold different beliefs.\n\nConcerns exist about adoption and the impact of gay families on society, but these fears are largely unfounded. Gay parents provide loving homes, and children raised by same-sex couples fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples. \n\nThe argument that homosexuality is a psychological defect is also disproven by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has clearly stated this.  It's important to rely on research and facts rather than prejudice and misinformation. \n\nI strongly believe the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand that a drug's legality doesn't determine its medicinal value.  While I believe marijuana shouldn't be widely available to the public, I support its use for medical purposes. Many controlled substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are legal for medical use despite their potential for abuse.  The same logic applies to marijuana - its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply because of its illegal status.\n\nI understand the concerns about marijuana abuse, but I think gradual legalization, coupled with education to remove the stigma surrounding it, could lead to responsible use. It's not as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine, and its negative image is largely fueled by its illegality. If we change public perception, people might be more likely to use marijuana responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more casual in recent times, with less emphasis on formal attire and shorter services, especially for teenagers. They note that people now attend mass in more comfortable clothing, even beachwear in summer.  While acknowledging the church's ongoing challenges, the speaker doesn't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia. They argue that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and that marriage wouldn't necessarily change an individual's predisposition.",
            "I initially supported the idea of the Iraq War, but the events of 9/11 heavily influenced the public's perception. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction, claims that were later proven false. This manipulation of information deeply troubled me and evokes strong negative feelings towards the war. \n\nI believe the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people, and their actions constitute malfeasance in office. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted his doubts about its validity. To me, this level of deception towards the public is a serious offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, particularly after 9/11. \n\nThere's a strong suspicion that the Bush administration entered office with a pre-conceived plan to go to war, possibly fueled by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's administration and a desire to secure energy resources.\n\nWhile the war needs to end, an immediate withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution involves a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order in Iraq. However, this approach raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and potential future instability. \n\nThe current Iraqi government is struggling, with a weak parliament and a Prime Minister lacking effective control.  Political factions, including those led by figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, creating a volatile and unstable environment.",
            "The speaker expresses mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They believe it was an unjustified response to the 9/11 attacks, driven by a desire for revenge and resource control.  They question the effectiveness of staying in Iraq to build democracy, arguing that it's a lengthy process that could lead to resentment and instability if the U.S. withdraws. The speaker also acknowledges the human cost of the war, mentioning families with loved ones in Iraq and the destruction caused by the conflict. Ultimately, they believe the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, fueling hatred towards the U.S. and exacerbating the situation in Iraq.",
            "The speaker strongly opposes government involvement in regulating religious practices, believing it violates the principle of separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempts to legislate on this issue amount to favoring one religious viewpoint over others, particularly as many Catholics and Christians oppose the practice in question.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any amendment aimed at banning the practice would be contradictory to the Constitution's core values of religious tolerance and would uniquely restrict individual liberties rather than government power. They believe the decision should remain with individual churches, not with the government, as there are no compelling reasons, such as economic impact, to justify such an amendment.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, believing the government misled the American public about its justification. They argue that the invasion was linked to the September 11th terrorist attacks to exploit public outrage, despite little connection between the two events. The speaker views the war as a repetition of the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThey criticize the lack of preparation for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and instability. The speaker compares the situation to Vietnam, where the US attempted to impose democracy, facing resistance from insurgents. They emphasize that fighting a war against a populace rather than a formal army is incredibly difficult.\n\nThe speaker believes the US should have thoroughly planned for all potential outcomes before engaging in war and criticizes the government for underestimating the complexity of establishing a new government. They feel the US government misled the public about the war's duration and success, suggesting naivete on the part of Americans who believed in a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges the moral dilemma of abandoning Iraq after removing its government but also highlights the substantial American casualties and questions the cost of pursuing a free democratic Iraq. They question the US's selective approach to democracy promotion, citing the lack of intervention in North Korea despite their known weapons of mass destruction, suggesting the influence of oil interests.\n\nFinally, the speaker expresses hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its immediate realization.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it may have biological roots rather than sociological ones. Denying people rights based on something beyond their control feels inhumane.\n\nI believe politics and government shouldn't interfere in this deeply personal matter. It's about individual families, not a matter for the state.  I see loving gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, raising their children and participating in the community. It's frustrating that they can't legally marry because of political interference, particularly when someone like President Bush tries to impose his personal interpretation of marriage.\n\nScientific evidence suggests that homosexuality may be biologically predetermined, not a choice influenced by upbringing or environment. This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe discrepancy in how society treats heterosexual and homosexual relationships is glaring. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without fanfare, while gay couples face public scrutiny and legal battles. Marriage should be a private matter, not subject to national or federal legislation.",
            "Sharing information online is like putting it in a public square; everyone can see it.  Anything you post, especially concerning violence, can shape others' perceptions of you. If someone sees a disturbing post, they might report it to the authorities, even if it was intended as a joke. Schools have a responsibility to take such reports seriously to ensure student safety. However, it's a delicate balance because not everything online is a genuine threat. Sometimes, it might be an innocent experiment or a misunderstanding.  \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that there's no real privacy online. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it.  They also express concerns about school officials excessively monitoring students' social media profiles, comparing it to invading their privacy. They believe that if information is brought to the school's attention, they must investigate, but teachers shouldn't proactively monitor students' online activities.  The speaker uses the example of not wanting to be friends with their residents on social media because they don't want to be privy to their personal lives.",
            "I believe the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, I feel we've strayed from that purpose. It now seems like we're fighting simply to assert our dominance as a superpower. Furthermore, I suspect the original motives were questionable, possibly stemming from personal conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the war's aim was genuinely to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems, that would have been a justifiable reason. However, if personal interests played a role, it would have been unfair. Regardless, the war has dragged on for far too long. \n\nThe initial military action might have served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged conflict feels excessive. It's as if we're fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a peaceful resolution.\n\nUltimately, I believe the war has gone on too long. It's time for the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security. We've been spending billions of dollars on this conflict, diverting resources from crucial domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure improvements, healthcare, and education. These are areas that desperately need funding. \n\nContinuing to pour money into a war that has lost its original purpose is a drain on our economy and resources.",
            "The speaker is discussing the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace. They argue that information posted online is generally accessible to the public and that users should be aware of this when sharing personal details. They acknowledge the potential dangers of online predators but also highlight the benefits of social media for communication and connection. The speaker raises the question of whether schools have the right to ban students from using platforms like Myspace, questioning the extent of their authority in this regard.",
            "I feel uncomfortable discussing the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it now.  While I personally opposed the war from the start, it's not as relevant anymore. The vast majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis and even American troops stationed there, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw.  \n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning, and pulling out will likely be difficult as well.  The cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East are too vast for any administration to understand, and attempting to impose democracy in a region that doesn't want it is futile.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, invading Iraq was a misguided decision. The negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits, and the situation has become like quicksand. I don't see a valid reason for us to remain in Iraq any longer. While the administration might have reasons for staying, I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't object.  However, I believe we should leave as soon as possible.  Polling shows that most Iraqis want us gone within the year, and they are the ones we are supposedly trying to help.\n\nPerhaps they know best. If we ask them if they want us to leave and they say yes, at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go badly after we leave, we can say we were willing to stay but they decided otherwise.  \n\nWhile we'll likely never be seen as \"good guys\" in the Middle East, leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "The speaker believes gender discrimination still exists in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their chosen field.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where societal expectations and historical biases can prevent them from achieving top positions despite their qualifications. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents often face societal disapproval and judgment. In fields like fashion, men may encounter skepticism regarding their expertise due to traditional stereotypes. \n\nWhile progress has been made, the speaker acknowledges that change is gradual.  They suggest that promoting the positive qualities of those traditionally stereotyped can help challenge these biases without being overly forceful. The speaker also points out that discrimination can extend beyond gender, encompassing factors like socioeconomic background and education level.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalization and decriminalization of marijuana. They explain that decriminalization treats marijuana possession as a minor offense, similar to a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge. While this reduces the legal consequences, it doesn't eliminate the potential for future ramifications, particularly for job applications. \n\nThe speaker argues that decriminalization can be financially beneficial for municipalities struggling with budget constraints. The cost of arresting, processing, and prosecuting marijuana possession cases is significant.  They suggest that decriminalization can free up resources for other public services, like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities may be resistant to decriminalization due to moral or philosophical objections. However, they believe that in more open-minded communities, decriminalization can be a positive step.\n\nThe speaker also raises concerns about the potential consequences of full legalization, imagining scenarios where marijuana is readily available in places like gas stations, potentially leading to increased use and instances of marijuana-impaired driving. They note that marijuana use remains socially taboo in many contexts and that widespread legalization could create discomfort.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the potential adverse effects of both alcohol and marijuana, emphasizing that everyone reacts differently to substances and that moderation is key.",
            "While I acknowledge the value of tradition within the Catholic Church, I believe its rigid adherence to outdated doctrines and practices can be problematic. For example, the Church's refusal to marry interfaith couples, like my parents, demonstrates a lack of tolerance towards other religions despite the teaching to love all.  The Church's strictness and judgmental attitude towards those who don't perfectly adhere to its doctrines can also be alienating.  \n\nThe issue of priests marrying is complex. While I support allowing priests to marry, I don't believe it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse, as the root cause lies in the perpetrator's character, not their marital status.",
            "While I haven't fully formed an opinion on this complex issue, I believe it's one of the most challenging we face today. The intersection of separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is delicate and easily polarizing. \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a more appropriate approach. Defining marriage solely as a government-sanctioned institution, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some, feels inconsistent. Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious practices like baptism, they shouldn't dictate the specific form of a marriage. \n\nUltimately, civil unions recognize the commitment between two individuals without imposing religious or governmental interpretations. If all states agree on this approach, they should strive for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\nWhile this issue is important to many, its significance doesn't warrant amending the Constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I have many gay friends and believe they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, I personally don't agree with that lifestyle.  However, I think marriage equality should be a decision made at the state level, not by the federal government.\n\nDifferent states have different political leanings – democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while republican states may not. I believe individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by their elected officials regarding issues like same-sex marriage.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage because I think it's unfair for one person to impose their views on the entire country.  States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. This issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is in the White House, so it's best to let individual states determine their own policies.",
            "The speaker believes that school officials had the right to view a student's MySpace profile because it was a public platform. They acknowledge that accessing personal information online raises privacy concerns, but argue that if it prevents harm or improves school safety, it's justifiable. They draw parallels to school security measures like lockdown drills, which are implemented to protect students from potential threats. The speaker emphasizes that while students should be cautious about what they post online, they should also understand that information on public platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. Ultimately, the speaker believes that school officials acted appropriately by monitoring student activity online to ensure a safe learning environment.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 deeply affected me personally. I felt the urge for revenge and wanted to inflict the same pain they caused us. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed rational planning. We went into the war unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired. \n\nI've become disillusioned with the conflict. I feel that as long as internal strife continues within the region, they will be less likely to pose a threat to us. Our presence doesn't seem to be making a difference, and I've lost empathy for the people there. They seem incapable of resolving their own conflicts, which makes it difficult to justify our involvement.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared for the realities of conflict in that region. Their approach to warfare is brutal and seemingly driven by a desire to push us out rather than improve their country. I believe the best course of action is to withdraw our forces. \n\nOur initial motivations were likely fueled by anger and a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out plan. I understand President Bush's position; we couldn't simply ignore the attacks. However, we lacked a clear objective and unity of purpose.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or bringing lasting peace. Their internal divisions seem too deep-rooted. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify continued involvement. Staying longer will likely only prolong the suffering and ultimately lead to a collapse once we leave. It's time for us to withdraw and focus on our own well-being."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church needs to update its views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, as its stance on these matters is considered outdated by some.  They feel these strict views contribute to the decline in the Church's following, as people who hold different beliefs may feel unwelcome. The speaker uses examples like abortion and gay marriage to illustrate how individuals who support these rights might find it difficult to align with the Church's teachings. They also question the logic of priests being \"married to God\" while being unable to have families, suggesting that priests could benefit from having both a religious and a personal life.",
            "While I haven't deeply considered the topic, I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and people shouldn't be held responsible for who they're attracted to. It seems unfair to allow heterosexual couples to marry but not same-sex couples. I don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue as it's a matter of personal freedom and doesn't affect national security or morality. It simply feels like an intrusion into people's lives to dictate who they can marry.",
            "I believe gay marriage should be legal because there's no valid reason to oppose it.  Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but this comparison is flawed.  \n\nMany civil rights are tied to marriage, including healthcare and property ownership. For example, a partner in a same-sex relationship can't be present in a hospital room or make medical decisions if the other is ill because they aren't legally recognized as family.  \n\nNumerous studies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and factors contributing to happiness as heterosexual relationships. \n\nAdvocates for gay marriage are not seeking religious approval; they simply want a legal document from the government.  \n\nThe argument that religious beliefs should dictate law is problematic, as it would infringe on the rights of those who hold different beliefs.\n\nConcerns exist about adoption and the impact of gay families on society, but these fears are largely unfounded. Gay parents provide loving homes, and children raised by same-sex couples fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples. \n\nThe argument that homosexuality is a psychological defect is also disproven by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has clearly stated this.  It's important to rely on research and facts rather than prejudice and misinformation. \n\nI strongly believe the federal government should legalize gay marriage nationwide.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and have seen firsthand that a drug's legality doesn't determine its medicinal value.  While I believe marijuana shouldn't be widely available to the public, I support its use for medical purposes. Many controlled substances, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are legal for medical use despite their potential for abuse.  The same logic applies to marijuana - its potential benefits shouldn't be dismissed simply because of its illegal status.\n\nI understand the concerns about marijuana abuse, but I think gradual legalization, coupled with education to remove the stigma surrounding it, could lead to responsible use. It's not as dangerous as substances like heroin or cocaine, and its negative image is largely fueled by its illegality. If we change public perception, people might be more likely to use marijuana responsibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more casual in recent times, with less emphasis on formal attire and shorter services, especially for teenagers. They note that people now attend mass in more comfortable clothing, even beachwear in summer.  While acknowledging the church's ongoing challenges, the speaker doesn't think allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry would have prevented the issue of pedophilia. They argue that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics and that marriage wouldn't necessarily change an individual's predisposition.",
            "I initially supported the idea of the Iraq War, but the events of 9/11 heavily influenced the public's perception. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction, claims that were later proven false. This manipulation of information deeply troubled me and evokes strong negative feelings towards the war. \n\nI believe the Bush administration deliberately misled the American people, and their actions constitute malfeasance in office. Even Colin Powell, who presented the evidence at the UN, has since admitted his doubts about its validity. To me, this level of deception towards the public is a serious offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, particularly after 9/11. \n\nThere's a strong suspicion that the Bush administration entered office with a pre-conceived plan to go to war, possibly fueled by a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's administration and a desire to secure energy resources.\n\nWhile the war needs to end, an immediate withdrawal could lead to civil war and more casualties. The proposed solution involves a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order in Iraq. However, this approach raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and potential future instability. \n\nThe current Iraqi government is struggling, with a weak parliament and a Prime Minister lacking effective control.  Political factions, including those led by figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, are vying for power, creating a volatile and unstable environment.",
            "The speaker expresses mixed feelings about the War in Iraq. They believe it was an unjustified response to the 9/11 attacks, driven by a desire for revenge and resource control.  They question the effectiveness of staying in Iraq to build democracy, arguing that it's a lengthy process that could lead to resentment and instability if the U.S. withdraws. The speaker also acknowledges the human cost of the war, mentioning families with loved ones in Iraq and the destruction caused by the conflict. Ultimately, they believe the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, fueling hatred towards the U.S. and exacerbating the situation in Iraq.",
            "The speaker strongly opposes government involvement in regulating religious practices, believing it violates the principle of separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempts to legislate on this issue amount to favoring one religious viewpoint over others, particularly as many Catholics and Christians oppose the practice in question.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any amendment aimed at banning the practice would be contradictory to the Constitution's core values of religious tolerance and would uniquely restrict individual liberties rather than government power. They believe the decision should remain with individual churches, not with the government, as there are no compelling reasons, such as economic impact, to justify such an amendment.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, believing the government misled the American public about its justification. They argue that the invasion was linked to the September 11th terrorist attacks to exploit public outrage, despite little connection between the two events. The speaker views the war as a repetition of the Vietnam War, where the US government failed to learn from past mistakes.\n\nThey criticize the lack of preparation for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government, leading to chaos and instability. The speaker compares the situation to Vietnam, where the US attempted to impose democracy, facing resistance from insurgents. They emphasize that fighting a war against a populace rather than a formal army is incredibly difficult.\n\nThe speaker believes the US should have thoroughly planned for all potential outcomes before engaging in war and criticizes the government for underestimating the complexity of establishing a new government. They feel the US government misled the public about the war's duration and success, suggesting naivete on the part of Americans who believed in a quick and easy victory.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges the moral dilemma of abandoning Iraq after removing its government but also highlights the substantial American casualties and questions the cost of pursuing a free democratic Iraq. They question the US's selective approach to democracy promotion, citing the lack of intervention in North Korea despite their known weapons of mass destruction, suggesting the influence of oil interests.\n\nFinally, the speaker expresses hope for peace in Iraq but doubts its immediate realization.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a personal choice, and research increasingly suggests it may have biological roots rather than sociological ones. Denying people rights based on something beyond their control feels inhumane.\n\nI believe politics and government shouldn't interfere in this deeply personal matter. It's about individual families, not a matter for the state.  I see loving gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, raising their children and participating in the community. It's frustrating that they can't legally marry because of political interference, particularly when someone like President Bush tries to impose his personal interpretation of marriage.\n\nScientific evidence suggests that homosexuality may be biologically predetermined, not a choice influenced by upbringing or environment. This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe discrepancy in how society treats heterosexual and homosexual relationships is glaring. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without fanfare, while gay couples face public scrutiny and legal battles. Marriage should be a private matter, not subject to national or federal legislation.",
            "Sharing information online is like putting it in a public square; everyone can see it.  Anything you post, especially concerning violence, can shape others' perceptions of you. If someone sees a disturbing post, they might report it to the authorities, even if it was intended as a joke. Schools have a responsibility to take such reports seriously to ensure student safety. However, it's a delicate balance because not everything online is a genuine threat. Sometimes, it might be an innocent experiment or a misunderstanding.  \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that there's no real privacy online. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it.  They also express concerns about school officials excessively monitoring students' social media profiles, comparing it to invading their privacy. They believe that if information is brought to the school's attention, they must investigate, but teachers shouldn't proactively monitor students' online activities.  The speaker uses the example of not wanting to be friends with their residents on social media because they don't want to be privy to their personal lives.",
            "I believe the war has been unnecessarily prolonged. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, I feel we've strayed from that purpose. It now seems like we're fighting simply to assert our dominance as a superpower. Furthermore, I suspect the original motives were questionable, possibly stemming from personal conflicts between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the war's aim was genuinely to bring democracy to a country lacking fair political systems, that would have been a justifiable reason. However, if personal interests played a role, it would have been unfair. Regardless, the war has dragged on for far too long. \n\nThe initial military action might have served as a powerful statement, but the prolonged conflict feels excessive. It's as if we're fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a peaceful resolution.\n\nUltimately, I believe the war has gone on too long. It's time for the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security. We've been spending billions of dollars on this conflict, diverting resources from crucial domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure improvements, healthcare, and education. These are areas that desperately need funding. \n\nContinuing to pour money into a war that has lost its original purpose is a drain on our economy and resources.",
            "The speaker is discussing the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace. They argue that information posted online is generally accessible to the public and that users should be aware of this when sharing personal details. They acknowledge the potential dangers of online predators but also highlight the benefits of social media for communication and connection. The speaker raises the question of whether schools have the right to ban students from using platforms like Myspace, questioning the extent of their authority in this regard.",
            "I feel uncomfortable discussing the Iraq War because it seems like everyone else is against it now.  While I personally opposed the war from the start, it's not as relevant anymore. The vast majority of people worldwide, including Iraqis and even American troops stationed there, believe it was a mistake and that we should withdraw.  \n\nThe war has been a disaster from the beginning, and pulling out will likely be difficult as well.  The cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East are too vast for any administration to understand, and attempting to impose democracy in a region that doesn't want it is futile.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a bad leader, invading Iraq was a misguided decision. The negative consequences outweigh any potential benefits, and the situation has become like quicksand. I don't see a valid reason for us to remain in Iraq any longer. While the administration might have reasons for staying, I haven't heard any convincing arguments.\n\nIf they want to withdraw gradually over a year or so, I wouldn't object.  However, I believe we should leave as soon as possible.  Polling shows that most Iraqis want us gone within the year, and they are the ones we are supposedly trying to help.\n\nPerhaps they know best. If we ask them if they want us to leave and they say yes, at least we can say we gave them a choice. If things go badly after we leave, we can say we were willing to stay but they decided otherwise.  \n\nWhile we'll likely never be seen as \"good guys\" in the Middle East, leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "The speaker believes gender discrimination still exists in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their chosen field.  Women face a \"glass ceiling\" where societal expectations and historical biases can prevent them from achieving top positions despite their qualifications. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents often face societal disapproval and judgment. In fields like fashion, men may encounter skepticism regarding their expertise due to traditional stereotypes. \n\nWhile progress has been made, the speaker acknowledges that change is gradual.  They suggest that promoting the positive qualities of those traditionally stereotyped can help challenge these biases without being overly forceful. The speaker also points out that discrimination can extend beyond gender, encompassing factors like socioeconomic background and education level.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalization and decriminalization of marijuana. They explain that decriminalization treats marijuana possession as a minor offense, similar to a traffic ticket, rather than a criminal charge. While this reduces the legal consequences, it doesn't eliminate the potential for future ramifications, particularly for job applications. \n\nThe speaker argues that decriminalization can be financially beneficial for municipalities struggling with budget constraints. The cost of arresting, processing, and prosecuting marijuana possession cases is significant.  They suggest that decriminalization can free up resources for other public services, like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that some communities may be resistant to decriminalization due to moral or philosophical objections. However, they believe that in more open-minded communities, decriminalization can be a positive step.\n\nThe speaker also raises concerns about the potential consequences of full legalization, imagining scenarios where marijuana is readily available in places like gas stations, potentially leading to increased use and instances of marijuana-impaired driving. They note that marijuana use remains socially taboo in many contexts and that widespread legalization could create discomfort.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the potential adverse effects of both alcohol and marijuana, emphasizing that everyone reacts differently to substances and that moderation is key.",
            "While I acknowledge the value of tradition within the Catholic Church, I believe its rigid adherence to outdated doctrines and practices can be problematic. For example, the Church's refusal to marry interfaith couples, like my parents, demonstrates a lack of tolerance towards other religions despite the teaching to love all.  The Church's strictness and judgmental attitude towards those who don't perfectly adhere to its doctrines can also be alienating.  \n\nThe issue of priests marrying is complex. While I support allowing priests to marry, I don't believe it would necessarily prevent instances of child abuse, as the root cause lies in the perpetrator's character, not their marital status.",
            "While I haven't fully formed an opinion on this complex issue, I believe it's one of the most challenging we face today. The intersection of separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is delicate and easily polarizing. \n\nPersonally, I think civil unions are a more appropriate approach. Defining marriage solely as a government-sanctioned institution, especially when it's considered a sacrament by some, feels inconsistent. Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious practices like baptism, they shouldn't dictate the specific form of a marriage. \n\nUltimately, civil unions recognize the commitment between two individuals without imposing religious or governmental interpretations. If all states agree on this approach, they should strive for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n\nWhile this issue is important to many, its significance doesn't warrant amending the Constitution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I have many gay friends and believe they should have the same opportunities as everyone else, I personally don't agree with that lifestyle.  However, I think marriage equality should be a decision made at the state level, not by the federal government.\n\nDifferent states have different political leanings – democratic states tend to be more supportive of gay marriage, while republican states may not. I believe individuals living in a state should respect the decisions made by their elected officials regarding issues like same-sex marriage.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage because I think it's unfair for one person to impose their views on the entire country.  States should have the autonomy to decide what's best for their residents. This issue will likely continue to be debated regardless of who is in the White House, so it's best to let individual states determine their own policies.",
            "The speaker believes that school officials had the right to view a student's MySpace profile because it was a public platform. They acknowledge that accessing personal information online raises privacy concerns, but argue that if it prevents harm or improves school safety, it's justifiable. They draw parallels to school security measures like lockdown drills, which are implemented to protect students from potential threats. The speaker emphasizes that while students should be cautious about what they post online, they should also understand that information on public platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. Ultimately, the speaker believes that school officials acted appropriately by monitoring student activity online to ensure a safe learning environment.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because 9/11 deeply affected me personally. I felt the urge for revenge and wanted to inflict the same pain they caused us. However, I now believe our emotional response overshadowed rational planning. We went into the war unprepared and without a clear strategy, which ultimately backfired. \n\nI've become disillusioned with the conflict. I feel that as long as internal strife continues within the region, they will be less likely to pose a threat to us. Our presence doesn't seem to be making a difference, and I've lost empathy for the people there. They seem incapable of resolving their own conflicts, which makes it difficult to justify our involvement.\n\nWe went into the war unprepared for the realities of conflict in that region. Their approach to warfare is brutal and seemingly driven by a desire to push us out rather than improve their country. I believe the best course of action is to withdraw our forces. \n\nOur initial motivations were likely fueled by anger and a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out plan. I understand President Bush's position; we couldn't simply ignore the attacks. However, we lacked a clear objective and unity of purpose.\n\nUltimately, I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or bringing lasting peace. Their internal divisions seem too deep-rooted. We've made some progress, but not enough to justify continued involvement. Staying longer will likely only prolong the suffering and ultimately lead to a collapse once we leave. It's time for us to withdraw and focus on our own well-being."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to remain relevant.  Many people are leaving the church because its stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is seen as outdated and inflexible. The church's strong, traditional views on these topics clash with the evolving views of society, leading to a disconnect with some members.  Allowing for more modern interpretations and perspectives, such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to be married, could help the church bridge this gap and avoid further decline in membership.",
            "I don't have a strong opinion on gay marriage, but I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry just because they are gay. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, so people shouldn't be held responsible for it. It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI think it's like being born straight or gay – it's not a decision you make. I don't believe the federal government should be involved in this issue because it's a personal matter and not a legal or moral issue.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people shouldn't be treated differently or punished for their sexual orientation.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there's no valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but I believe these relationships are fundamentally different.  They are like two sides of the same coin – distinct yet interconnected. \n\nLegalizing gay marriage grants them essential civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a partner of a gay couple may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized partner or make medical decisions because they lack legal recognition.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nIt's important to understand that gay couples are seeking a legal document from the government, not religious approval. They are asking for equal recognition under the law, not an endorsement by any particular faith.  \n\nConcerns about adoption and community impacts are unfounded. Children of gay couples thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nUltimately, this debate boils down to fairness and equality. The government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, rooted in religious beliefs, is inconsistent with the separation of church and state.  \n\nIt's crucial to base our policies on evidence and reason, not prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that homosexuality is a psychological disorder. We should rely on scientific research and expert opinions, not stereotypes and cultural biases.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. While I strongly oppose making illegal drugs widely accessible to the public, I support their use for medicinal purposes. Many controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin are legally used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits. It's illogical to deny these potential benefits based solely on societal stigma surrounding marijuana. \n\nI believe marijuana should be approached gradually, with its legal status evolving over time to allow for responsible use. While alcohol can also be abused, its current legal status doesn't necessarily make it a worse substance.  \n\nThe negative image surrounding marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and removing this stigma could encourage responsible use, particularly for medical applications.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in recent times, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe that younger generations are catered to with shorter, more casual services. While acknowledging the church's past strictness, they see these adaptations as positive.  \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, the speaker doubts that allowing female priests or marriage would have prevented these issues. They argue that pedophilia is rooted in individual genetics and personality, rather than celibacy or marital status. They believe those with such inclinations would still act on them regardless of their marital or professional status. \n\nThe speaker suggests that individuals who desire marriage and religious practice might consider other faiths that allow for both.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, arguing that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking it to 9/11 and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. They believe these actions constitute malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. The speaker also criticizes the administration's disregard for the Constitution and their perceived intent to go to war. They suggest that President Bush had personal animosity towards Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's presidency and ulterior motives related to energy resources.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the US withdrew immediately, the speaker expresses concern about the proposed solution of a coalition of regional nations stabilizing Iraq. They worry this will further complicate the situation by raising issues of Iraqi sovereignty and potentially exacerbating political instability.\n\nThe speaker points to the ineffective Iraqi Parliament, the Prime Minister's limited control, and the prominence of radical factions like al-Sadr's party as evidence of the ongoing political turmoil. They conclude with a pessimistic outlook on the situation, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of the Iraqi political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty about the War in Iraq, feeling it lacks a clear purpose and is driven by a desire for revenge after the 9/11 attacks. They question the justification for ongoing US involvement, citing the goal of establishing democracy and securing oil resources, while acknowledging the negative consequences for Iraqis and the potential for resentment. They struggle with the conflicting perspectives of supporting troops while recognizing the war's destructive impact on Iraqi society and culture. The speaker ultimately believes the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, potentially exacerbating tensions and hindering lasting peace.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere with religious practices, citing the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate on this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious viewpoint over others, as demonstrated by the push for an amendment based on the personal beliefs of a Catholic individual.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any attempt to ban the practice would be discriminatory and potentially harmful to society. They believe the decision regarding its legality should rest solely with the churches themselves, as it is a matter of personal faith and conscience.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They strongly oppose war, especially preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes. The speaker criticizes the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion, the removal of the Iraqi government, and the inability to create a stable democracy. They argue that the US government underestimated the challenges of implementing democracy in Iraq and deceived the public about the war's swift and successful outcome. The speaker acknowledges the dilemma of leaving Iraq after the US has been involved for so long, but also expresses concern over the high number of American casualties and the questionable motivations behind the war, particularly the potential role of oil resources. They question the US government's decision-making process, citing the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq and the silence regarding North Korea's known nuclear program. Ultimately, the speaker expresses a desire for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a matter of personal preference, and there's increasing evidence that sexual orientation is biological rather than sociological.  Taking away rights from people based on something they have no control over, like their sexual orientation, is inhumane. I believe government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, individual decision, not a public issue.\n\nI know several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, despite not being legally married.  It's unfair that they can't have the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples. I think it's inappropriate for politicians like President Bush to try to define marriage according to their own beliefs.\n\nScientific research suggests that homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly linked to brain chemistry. This is different from sociological explanations that suggest sexual orientation is influenced by upbringing or environment. \n\nFurthermore, marriage should be a private matter. Heterosexual couples can easily get married without any public attention, but gay couples face media scrutiny and social pressure. Marriage equality should be a personal choice, not a subject of public debate or government control.",
            "Sharing content online makes it public and visible to everyone.  As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've encountered situations where online posts have impacted people's perceptions. If you post about potentially harmful actions, like violence or threats, someone might take it seriously and report it, leading to consequences. Schools have a responsibility to address such concerns, even if the post was intended as a joke, as they need to ensure student safety. \n\nWhile there's no expectation of privacy on public platforms, it's important to consider the potential impact of your online presence. If you don't want something to be seen or interpreted in a certain way, it's best not to share it online.  \n\nIt's also crucial to remember that school officials shouldn't be overly intrusive by monitoring students' private online activity. However, if a concerning post is brought to their attention by someone with access to it, they have a responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action. The line blurs when school officials impersonate students or engage in excessive monitoring, which crosses ethical boundaries.",
            "The speaker believes the war has been prolonged unnecessarily. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, the speaker feels that objective has been lost. They suspect the war's continuation is driven by a desire to assert global dominance rather than any genuine commitment to democracy. The speaker also questions the initial motives, suggesting a possible connection to personal vendettas from George Bush Sr. \n\nAlthough the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country under tyranny as justifiable, they argue that the purpose has become distorted over time. They feel the war is now driven by a need to achieve victory, regardless of the original cause, and that the prolonged conflict has become detrimental to the US economy. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that the billions spent on the war could be better allocated to domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They believe the war is no longer serving a meaningful purpose and should end, allowing the citizens of the war-torn country to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The conversation centers around the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace.  While acknowledging that information shared online is generally public, the speaker raises concerns about the potential for misuse and invasion of privacy. They discuss instances where someone might stumble upon concerning information on a profile and potentially prevent harm, but also question the feasibility and ethicality of actively monitoring student profiles for potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experiences with Facebook, highlighting the discomfort of knowing that strangers can access personal information and potentially exploit it. They mention a news story about a man who easily obtained personal details from a girl's profile and used it to contact her, emphasizing the risks associated with online interactions. \n\nFinally, the speaker reflects on the controversy surrounding schools banning Myspace, questioning the authority of institutions to dictate students' online activity and expressing uncertainty about the legality of such restrictions.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake from the beginning, citing widespread public opinion against it both domestically and internationally. They argue that the war has been a disaster and that pulling out is also likely to be challenging.  The speaker believes the cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East make it difficult for American administrations to understand the region and impose their own ideals. While acknowledging that Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading another country. \n\nThe speaker believes the U.S. should leave Iraq as soon as possible, citing polls showing a strong desire for withdrawal among Iraqi citizens. They argue that if the U.S. asks the Iraqi people if they want them to stay and they say no, it would be a legitimate reason for withdrawal. While acknowledging that the U.S. will likely never be seen as \"the good guys\" in the Middle East, they believe leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just about women; it also affects men depending on their field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal biases. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home can be judged and stereotyped. In industries like fashion, men may be met with skepticism because of preconceived notions about masculinity.  However, gradual change is occurring. More women are attaining leadership positions, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, and society is slowly challenging traditional gender roles. While change is slow, continued efforts to highlight the strengths and contributions of individuals regardless of gender or background are crucial.  Additionally, discrimination can stem from factors beyond gender, such as socioeconomic background or regional accents, further emphasizing the need for inclusivity and understanding.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They explain that decriminalization reduces possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a lesser offense, akin to a traffic ticket. While decriminalization removes some of the severe legal consequences associated with drug charges, it doesn't entirely eliminate future ramifications, particularly for job applications.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the financial implications of decriminalization, arguing that it can save municipalities money by reducing the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. They suggest that cities with more liberal viewpoints, like Denver, may be more receptive to decriminalization due to the potential financial benefits, allowing them to allocate resources to other important areas like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that complete legalization of marijuana raises concerns about its widespread accessibility and potential negative societal impacts, comparing it to the normalization of cigarette smoking. They express apprehension about the normalization of marijuana use in public spaces and the potential for increased instances of driving under the influence.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the subjective nature of drug effects, stating that both alcohol and marijuana have adverse consequences, though they manifest differently in individuals. They emphasize the variability in people's reactions to substances, highlighting the challenges of making generalizations about their overall impact.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has both positive and negative aspects. \n\nWhile I appreciate its emphasis on tradition, I also think it's important for institutions to adapt to change. One issue I have is the Church's strict adherence to doctrine and its perceived intolerance towards those who don't perfectly conform or belong to other religions.  \n\nFor example, my parents' marriage was denied in the Catholic Church because my father was Episcopalian, which demonstrates a lack of acceptance towards other faiths. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, creating a hypocritical situation. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that some Catholic teachings are outdated and the Church clings to them despite inconsistencies with modern values. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it could be beneficial, but it likely wouldn't prevent child abuse as that is a separate issue rooted in individual behavior rather than marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue yet, so I can't say definitively which side is right or wrong. However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today. Balancing the separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is incredibly delicate and easily leads to offense. \n\nI think all civil unions should be treated equally, regardless of religious or societal classifications.  The government shouldn't get involved in defining marriage based on religious doctrine, just as they don't for baptisms or other religious practices. If two people enter into a civil union, it should be recognized as such without further scrutiny.\n\nIdeally, if states can reach a consensus on a fair approach to same-sex marriage, they should push for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for issues that, while important to some, don't warrant such a significant change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legal. I think this issue should be decided at a state level rather than nationally.  \n\nDifferent states have diverse political leanings. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and individuals living in those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I believe all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal opportunities.  Therefore, I support legalizing same-sex marriage based on the discretion of each state.  \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't believe he should impose his views on the entire country, as each state has the right to govern itself.  \n\nFurthermore, the political landscape is constantly changing. If a future president lifts the ban, it will create a back-and-forth situation. It's more sensible to let each state decide on this issue, as they will be the ones living with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that Myspace being a public platform means that school officials have the right to access student posts, even if they aren't using the school's name. They argue that since anything on the internet is accessible, students should expect their posts to be seen by others, including school officials.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that searching for information about student misconduct is an invasion of privacy, but justifies school officials' actions if it prevents harm or improves school safety. They compare it to the measures taken after the terrorist attacks, where drills and security measures were implemented to ensure student safety. Ultimately, the speaker concludes that school officials' actions, though potentially controversial, are justifiable if they aim to prevent tragedies like Columbine.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about inflicting the same pain they caused us. However, I believe the intense emotions surrounding the event led to overlooking long-term consequences and a lack of preparedness. We went in without a clear plan and, in my view, it backfired.\n\nWhile I initially supported the war, I'm now strongly against it. I don't see it accomplishing anything.  If the Iraqi people continue to be divided, they won't be able to effectively fight us. I've become emotionally detached from the situation, feeling a lack of empathy for the people involved.\n\nI realize we went into the war unprepared, unaware of the challenges we would face. Their approach to war is vastly different from ours; they are more brutal and seem driven by a desire to expel us rather than improve their country.\n\nI believe we should withdraw and let them resolve their own issues. The initial motivation seemed to be revenge, fueled by public sentiment and President Bush's desire to act decisively. \n\nAlthough I understand the need to respond to the attacks, I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan. There was a lack of unity and clear objectives, which ultimately hindered our efforts.\n\nI think we went in driven by anger and emotion, which has only perpetuated the conflict. I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or values. Progress has been made, but not enough to justify our continued presence. I fear that once we leave, the situation will collapse, and our prolonged involvement is ultimately self-defeating."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to remain relevant.  Many people are leaving the church because its stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is seen as outdated and inflexible. The church's strong, traditional views on these topics clash with the evolving views of society, leading to a disconnect with some members.  Allowing for more modern interpretations and perspectives, such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to be married, could help the church bridge this gap and avoid further decline in membership.",
            "I don't have a strong opinion on gay marriage, but I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry just because they are gay. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, so people shouldn't be held responsible for it. It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI think it's like being born straight or gay – it's not a decision you make. I don't believe the federal government should be involved in this issue because it's a personal matter and not a legal or moral issue.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people shouldn't be treated differently or punished for their sexual orientation.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there's no valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but I believe these relationships are fundamentally different.  They are like two sides of the same coin – distinct yet interconnected. \n\nLegalizing gay marriage grants them essential civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a partner of a gay couple may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized partner or make medical decisions because they lack legal recognition.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nIt's important to understand that gay couples are seeking a legal document from the government, not religious approval. They are asking for equal recognition under the law, not an endorsement by any particular faith.  \n\nConcerns about adoption and community impacts are unfounded. Children of gay couples thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nUltimately, this debate boils down to fairness and equality. The government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, rooted in religious beliefs, is inconsistent with the separation of church and state.  \n\nIt's crucial to base our policies on evidence and reason, not prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that homosexuality is a psychological disorder. We should rely on scientific research and expert opinions, not stereotypes and cultural biases.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. While I strongly oppose making illegal drugs widely accessible to the public, I support their use for medicinal purposes. Many controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin are legally used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits. It's illogical to deny these potential benefits based solely on societal stigma surrounding marijuana. \n\nI believe marijuana should be approached gradually, with its legal status evolving over time to allow for responsible use. While alcohol can also be abused, its current legal status doesn't necessarily make it a worse substance.  \n\nThe negative image surrounding marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and removing this stigma could encourage responsible use, particularly for medical applications.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in recent times, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe that younger generations are catered to with shorter, more casual services. While acknowledging the church's past strictness, they see these adaptations as positive.  \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, the speaker doubts that allowing female priests or marriage would have prevented these issues. They argue that pedophilia is rooted in individual genetics and personality, rather than celibacy or marital status. They believe those with such inclinations would still act on them regardless of their marital or professional status. \n\nThe speaker suggests that individuals who desire marriage and religious practice might consider other faiths that allow for both.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, arguing that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking it to 9/11 and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. They believe these actions constitute malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. The speaker also criticizes the administration's disregard for the Constitution and their perceived intent to go to war. They suggest that President Bush had personal animosity towards Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's presidency and ulterior motives related to energy resources.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the US withdrew immediately, the speaker expresses concern about the proposed solution of a coalition of regional nations stabilizing Iraq. They worry this will further complicate the situation by raising issues of Iraqi sovereignty and potentially exacerbating political instability.\n\nThe speaker points to the ineffective Iraqi Parliament, the Prime Minister's limited control, and the prominence of radical factions like al-Sadr's party as evidence of the ongoing political turmoil. They conclude with a pessimistic outlook on the situation, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of the Iraqi political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty about the War in Iraq, feeling it lacks a clear purpose and is driven by a desire for revenge after the 9/11 attacks. They question the justification for ongoing US involvement, citing the goal of establishing democracy and securing oil resources, while acknowledging the negative consequences for Iraqis and the potential for resentment. They struggle with the conflicting perspectives of supporting troops while recognizing the war's destructive impact on Iraqi society and culture. The speaker ultimately believes the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, potentially exacerbating tensions and hindering lasting peace.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere with religious practices, citing the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate on this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious viewpoint over others, as demonstrated by the push for an amendment based on the personal beliefs of a Catholic individual.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any attempt to ban the practice would be discriminatory and potentially harmful to society. They believe the decision regarding its legality should rest solely with the churches themselves, as it is a matter of personal faith and conscience.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They strongly oppose war, especially preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes. The speaker criticizes the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion, the removal of the Iraqi government, and the inability to create a stable democracy. They argue that the US government underestimated the challenges of implementing democracy in Iraq and deceived the public about the war's swift and successful outcome. The speaker acknowledges the dilemma of leaving Iraq after the US has been involved for so long, but also expresses concern over the high number of American casualties and the questionable motivations behind the war, particularly the potential role of oil resources. They question the US government's decision-making process, citing the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq and the silence regarding North Korea's known nuclear program. Ultimately, the speaker expresses a desire for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a matter of personal preference, and there's increasing evidence that sexual orientation is biological rather than sociological.  Taking away rights from people based on something they have no control over, like their sexual orientation, is inhumane. I believe government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, individual decision, not a public issue.\n\nI know several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, despite not being legally married.  It's unfair that they can't have the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples. I think it's inappropriate for politicians like President Bush to try to define marriage according to their own beliefs.\n\nScientific research suggests that homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly linked to brain chemistry. This is different from sociological explanations that suggest sexual orientation is influenced by upbringing or environment. \n\nFurthermore, marriage should be a private matter. Heterosexual couples can easily get married without any public attention, but gay couples face media scrutiny and social pressure. Marriage equality should be a personal choice, not a subject of public debate or government control.",
            "Sharing content online makes it public and visible to everyone.  As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've encountered situations where online posts have impacted people's perceptions. If you post about potentially harmful actions, like violence or threats, someone might take it seriously and report it, leading to consequences. Schools have a responsibility to address such concerns, even if the post was intended as a joke, as they need to ensure student safety. \n\nWhile there's no expectation of privacy on public platforms, it's important to consider the potential impact of your online presence. If you don't want something to be seen or interpreted in a certain way, it's best not to share it online.  \n\nIt's also crucial to remember that school officials shouldn't be overly intrusive by monitoring students' private online activity. However, if a concerning post is brought to their attention by someone with access to it, they have a responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action. The line blurs when school officials impersonate students or engage in excessive monitoring, which crosses ethical boundaries.",
            "The speaker believes the war has been prolonged unnecessarily. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, the speaker feels that objective has been lost. They suspect the war's continuation is driven by a desire to assert global dominance rather than any genuine commitment to democracy. The speaker also questions the initial motives, suggesting a possible connection to personal vendettas from George Bush Sr. \n\nAlthough the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country under tyranny as justifiable, they argue that the purpose has become distorted over time. They feel the war is now driven by a need to achieve victory, regardless of the original cause, and that the prolonged conflict has become detrimental to the US economy. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that the billions spent on the war could be better allocated to domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They believe the war is no longer serving a meaningful purpose and should end, allowing the citizens of the war-torn country to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The conversation centers around the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace.  While acknowledging that information shared online is generally public, the speaker raises concerns about the potential for misuse and invasion of privacy. They discuss instances where someone might stumble upon concerning information on a profile and potentially prevent harm, but also question the feasibility and ethicality of actively monitoring student profiles for potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experiences with Facebook, highlighting the discomfort of knowing that strangers can access personal information and potentially exploit it. They mention a news story about a man who easily obtained personal details from a girl's profile and used it to contact her, emphasizing the risks associated with online interactions. \n\nFinally, the speaker reflects on the controversy surrounding schools banning Myspace, questioning the authority of institutions to dictate students' online activity and expressing uncertainty about the legality of such restrictions.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake from the beginning, citing widespread public opinion against it both domestically and internationally. They argue that the war has been a disaster and that pulling out is also likely to be challenging.  The speaker believes the cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East make it difficult for American administrations to understand the region and impose their own ideals. While acknowledging that Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading another country. \n\nThe speaker believes the U.S. should leave Iraq as soon as possible, citing polls showing a strong desire for withdrawal among Iraqi citizens. They argue that if the U.S. asks the Iraqi people if they want them to stay and they say no, it would be a legitimate reason for withdrawal. While acknowledging that the U.S. will likely never be seen as \"the good guys\" in the Middle East, they believe leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just about women; it also affects men depending on their field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal biases. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home can be judged and stereotyped. In industries like fashion, men may be met with skepticism because of preconceived notions about masculinity.  However, gradual change is occurring. More women are attaining leadership positions, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, and society is slowly challenging traditional gender roles. While change is slow, continued efforts to highlight the strengths and contributions of individuals regardless of gender or background are crucial.  Additionally, discrimination can stem from factors beyond gender, such as socioeconomic background or regional accents, further emphasizing the need for inclusivity and understanding.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They explain that decriminalization reduces possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a lesser offense, akin to a traffic ticket. While decriminalization removes some of the severe legal consequences associated with drug charges, it doesn't entirely eliminate future ramifications, particularly for job applications.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the financial implications of decriminalization, arguing that it can save municipalities money by reducing the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. They suggest that cities with more liberal viewpoints, like Denver, may be more receptive to decriminalization due to the potential financial benefits, allowing them to allocate resources to other important areas like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that complete legalization of marijuana raises concerns about its widespread accessibility and potential negative societal impacts, comparing it to the normalization of cigarette smoking. They express apprehension about the normalization of marijuana use in public spaces and the potential for increased instances of driving under the influence.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the subjective nature of drug effects, stating that both alcohol and marijuana have adverse consequences, though they manifest differently in individuals. They emphasize the variability in people's reactions to substances, highlighting the challenges of making generalizations about their overall impact.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has both positive and negative aspects. \n\nWhile I appreciate its emphasis on tradition, I also think it's important for institutions to adapt to change. One issue I have is the Church's strict adherence to doctrine and its perceived intolerance towards those who don't perfectly conform or belong to other religions.  \n\nFor example, my parents' marriage was denied in the Catholic Church because my father was Episcopalian, which demonstrates a lack of acceptance towards other faiths. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, creating a hypocritical situation. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that some Catholic teachings are outdated and the Church clings to them despite inconsistencies with modern values. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it could be beneficial, but it likely wouldn't prevent child abuse as that is a separate issue rooted in individual behavior rather than marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue yet, so I can't say definitively which side is right or wrong. However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today. Balancing the separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is incredibly delicate and easily leads to offense. \n\nI think all civil unions should be treated equally, regardless of religious or societal classifications.  The government shouldn't get involved in defining marriage based on religious doctrine, just as they don't for baptisms or other religious practices. If two people enter into a civil union, it should be recognized as such without further scrutiny.\n\nIdeally, if states can reach a consensus on a fair approach to same-sex marriage, they should push for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for issues that, while important to some, don't warrant such a significant change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legal. I think this issue should be decided at a state level rather than nationally.  \n\nDifferent states have diverse political leanings. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and individuals living in those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I believe all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal opportunities.  Therefore, I support legalizing same-sex marriage based on the discretion of each state.  \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't believe he should impose his views on the entire country, as each state has the right to govern itself.  \n\nFurthermore, the political landscape is constantly changing. If a future president lifts the ban, it will create a back-and-forth situation. It's more sensible to let each state decide on this issue, as they will be the ones living with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that Myspace being a public platform means that school officials have the right to access student posts, even if they aren't using the school's name. They argue that since anything on the internet is accessible, students should expect their posts to be seen by others, including school officials.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that searching for information about student misconduct is an invasion of privacy, but justifies school officials' actions if it prevents harm or improves school safety. They compare it to the measures taken after the terrorist attacks, where drills and security measures were implemented to ensure student safety. Ultimately, the speaker concludes that school officials' actions, though potentially controversial, are justifiable if they aim to prevent tragedies like Columbine.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about inflicting the same pain they caused us. However, I believe the intense emotions surrounding the event led to overlooking long-term consequences and a lack of preparedness. We went in without a clear plan and, in my view, it backfired.\n\nWhile I initially supported the war, I'm now strongly against it. I don't see it accomplishing anything.  If the Iraqi people continue to be divided, they won't be able to effectively fight us. I've become emotionally detached from the situation, feeling a lack of empathy for the people involved.\n\nI realize we went into the war unprepared, unaware of the challenges we would face. Their approach to war is vastly different from ours; they are more brutal and seem driven by a desire to expel us rather than improve their country.\n\nI believe we should withdraw and let them resolve their own issues. The initial motivation seemed to be revenge, fueled by public sentiment and President Bush's desire to act decisively. \n\nAlthough I understand the need to respond to the attacks, I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan. There was a lack of unity and clear objectives, which ultimately hindered our efforts.\n\nI think we went in driven by anger and emotion, which has only perpetuated the conflict. I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or values. Progress has been made, but not enough to justify our continued presence. I fear that once we leave, the situation will collapse, and our prolonged involvement is ultimately self-defeating."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to adapt its views to remain relevant.  Many people are leaving the church because its stance on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control is seen as outdated and inflexible. The church's strong, traditional views on these topics clash with the evolving views of society, leading to a disconnect with some members.  Allowing for more modern interpretations and perspectives, such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to be married, could help the church bridge this gap and avoid further decline in membership.",
            "I don't have a strong opinion on gay marriage, but I believe it's wrong to deny same-sex couples the right to marry just because they are gay. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, so people shouldn't be held responsible for it. It seems unfair to say that a man and a woman can marry but two people of the same sex can't.\n\nI think it's like being born straight or gay – it's not a decision you make. I don't believe the federal government should be involved in this issue because it's a personal matter and not a legal or moral issue.  It's not the government's place to interfere in people's lives and dictate who they can love. Gay people shouldn't be treated differently or punished for their sexual orientation.",
            "I support legalizing gay marriage because there's no valid reason against it. Some argue that same-sex couples threaten traditional families, but I believe these relationships are fundamentally different.  They are like two sides of the same coin – distinct yet interconnected. \n\nLegalizing gay marriage grants them essential civil rights, including healthcare benefits and property rights.  For instance, a partner of a gay couple may not be allowed to visit a hospitalized partner or make medical decisions because they lack legal recognition.\n\nStudies show that same-sex relationships have the same success rates and dynamics as heterosexual relationships.  \n\nIt's important to understand that gay couples are seeking a legal document from the government, not religious approval. They are asking for equal recognition under the law, not an endorsement by any particular faith.  \n\nConcerns about adoption and community impacts are unfounded. Children of gay couples thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nUltimately, this debate boils down to fairness and equality. The government should ensure equal rights for all citizens, regardless of sexual orientation. President Bush's stance on gay marriage, rooted in religious beliefs, is inconsistent with the separation of church and state.  \n\nIt's crucial to base our policies on evidence and reason, not prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that homosexuality is a psychological disorder. We should rely on scientific research and expert opinions, not stereotypes and cultural biases.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy and believe that just because a substance is illegal doesn't mean it's inherently harmful. While I strongly oppose making illegal drugs widely accessible to the public, I support their use for medicinal purposes. Many controlled substances like oxycodone and Vicodin are legally used in pharmacies because they have proven benefits. It's illogical to deny these potential benefits based solely on societal stigma surrounding marijuana. \n\nI believe marijuana should be approached gradually, with its legal status evolving over time to allow for responsible use. While alcohol can also be abused, its current legal status doesn't necessarily make it a worse substance.  \n\nThe negative image surrounding marijuana stems from its illegal status. It's not as harmful as drugs like heroin or cocaine, and removing this stigma could encourage responsible use, particularly for medical applications.",
            "The speaker believes the Catholic Church has become more relaxed in recent times, noting changes in dress code and service length. They observe that younger generations are catered to with shorter, more casual services. While acknowledging the church's past strictness, they see these adaptations as positive.  \n\nRegarding the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, the speaker doubts that allowing female priests or marriage would have prevented these issues. They argue that pedophilia is rooted in individual genetics and personality, rather than celibacy or marital status. They believe those with such inclinations would still act on them regardless of their marital or professional status. \n\nThe speaker suggests that individuals who desire marriage and religious practice might consider other faiths that allow for both.",
            "The speaker expresses strong disapproval of the Iraq War, arguing that the Bush administration misled the American people by linking it to 9/11 and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. They believe these actions constitute malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. The speaker also criticizes the administration's disregard for the Constitution and their perceived intent to go to war. They suggest that President Bush had personal animosity towards Saddam Hussein stemming from his father's presidency and ulterior motives related to energy resources.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential for chaos if the US withdrew immediately, the speaker expresses concern about the proposed solution of a coalition of regional nations stabilizing Iraq. They worry this will further complicate the situation by raising issues of Iraqi sovereignty and potentially exacerbating political instability.\n\nThe speaker points to the ineffective Iraqi Parliament, the Prime Minister's limited control, and the prominence of radical factions like al-Sadr's party as evidence of the ongoing political turmoil. They conclude with a pessimistic outlook on the situation, highlighting the complex and volatile nature of the Iraqi political landscape.",
            "The speaker expresses uncertainty about the War in Iraq, feeling it lacks a clear purpose and is driven by a desire for revenge after the 9/11 attacks. They question the justification for ongoing US involvement, citing the goal of establishing democracy and securing oil resources, while acknowledging the negative consequences for Iraqis and the potential for resentment. They struggle with the conflicting perspectives of supporting troops while recognizing the war's destructive impact on Iraqi society and culture. The speaker ultimately believes the war is pointless and will likely continue for years, potentially exacerbating tensions and hindering lasting peace.",
            "The speaker strongly believes that the government should not interfere with religious practices, citing the separation of church and state enshrined in the Constitution. They argue that attempting to legislate on this issue would violate this principle and favor one religious viewpoint over others, as demonstrated by the push for an amendment based on the personal beliefs of a Catholic individual.  \n\nThe speaker contends that any attempt to ban the practice would be discriminatory and potentially harmful to society. They believe the decision regarding its legality should rest solely with the churches themselves, as it is a matter of personal faith and conscience.",
            "The speaker believes the US government misled the American people about the reasons for the Iraq War, linking it to the 9/11 attacks when there was little connection. They strongly oppose war, especially preemptive strikes, and see the Iraq War as a repeat of the Vietnam War, with the government failing to learn from past mistakes. The speaker criticizes the lack of preparation for the aftermath of the invasion, the removal of the Iraqi government, and the inability to create a stable democracy. They argue that the US government underestimated the challenges of implementing democracy in Iraq and deceived the public about the war's swift and successful outcome. The speaker acknowledges the dilemma of leaving Iraq after the US has been involved for so long, but also expresses concern over the high number of American casualties and the questionable motivations behind the war, particularly the potential role of oil resources. They question the US government's decision-making process, citing the lack of weapons of mass destruction found in Iraq and the silence regarding North Korea's known nuclear program. Ultimately, the speaker expresses a desire for peace in Iraq but doubts its near future.",
            "I strongly support gay marriage. I've always believed it's a matter of personal preference, and there's increasing evidence that sexual orientation is biological rather than sociological.  Taking away rights from people based on something they have no control over, like their sexual orientation, is inhumane. I believe government shouldn't interfere in personal matters like marriage. It's a private, individual decision, not a public issue.\n\nI know several openly gay couples in my neighborhood who function just like any other family, despite not being legally married.  It's unfair that they can't have the same rights and recognition as heterosexual couples. I think it's inappropriate for politicians like President Bush to try to define marriage according to their own beliefs.\n\nScientific research suggests that homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly linked to brain chemistry. This is different from sociological explanations that suggest sexual orientation is influenced by upbringing or environment. \n\nFurthermore, marriage should be a private matter. Heterosexual couples can easily get married without any public attention, but gay couples face media scrutiny and social pressure. Marriage equality should be a personal choice, not a subject of public debate or government control.",
            "Sharing content online makes it public and visible to everyone.  As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've encountered situations where online posts have impacted people's perceptions. If you post about potentially harmful actions, like violence or threats, someone might take it seriously and report it, leading to consequences. Schools have a responsibility to address such concerns, even if the post was intended as a joke, as they need to ensure student safety. \n\nWhile there's no expectation of privacy on public platforms, it's important to consider the potential impact of your online presence. If you don't want something to be seen or interpreted in a certain way, it's best not to share it online.  \n\nIt's also crucial to remember that school officials shouldn't be overly intrusive by monitoring students' private online activity. However, if a concerning post is brought to their attention by someone with access to it, they have a responsibility to investigate and take appropriate action. The line blurs when school officials impersonate students or engage in excessive monitoring, which crosses ethical boundaries.",
            "The speaker believes the war has been prolonged unnecessarily. While the initial goal, restoring democracy in another country, might have been noble, the speaker feels that objective has been lost. They suspect the war's continuation is driven by a desire to assert global dominance rather than any genuine commitment to democracy. The speaker also questions the initial motives, suggesting a possible connection to personal vendettas from George Bush Sr. \n\nAlthough the speaker acknowledges the initial goal of bringing democracy to a country under tyranny as justifiable, they argue that the purpose has become distorted over time. They feel the war is now driven by a need to achieve victory, regardless of the original cause, and that the prolonged conflict has become detrimental to the US economy. \n\nThe speaker emphasizes that the billions spent on the war could be better allocated to domestic issues like poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. They believe the war is no longer serving a meaningful purpose and should end, allowing the citizens of the war-torn country to take responsibility for their own future.",
            "The conversation centers around the ethical implications of privacy on social media platforms like Myspace.  While acknowledging that information shared online is generally public, the speaker raises concerns about the potential for misuse and invasion of privacy. They discuss instances where someone might stumble upon concerning information on a profile and potentially prevent harm, but also question the feasibility and ethicality of actively monitoring student profiles for potentially dangerous content.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experiences with Facebook, highlighting the discomfort of knowing that strangers can access personal information and potentially exploit it. They mention a news story about a man who easily obtained personal details from a girl's profile and used it to contact her, emphasizing the risks associated with online interactions. \n\nFinally, the speaker reflects on the controversy surrounding schools banning Myspace, questioning the authority of institutions to dictate students' online activity and expressing uncertainty about the legality of such restrictions.",
            "The speaker expresses their belief that the Iraq War was a mistake from the beginning, citing widespread public opinion against it both domestically and internationally. They argue that the war has been a disaster and that pulling out is also likely to be challenging.  The speaker believes the cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East make it difficult for American administrations to understand the region and impose their own ideals. While acknowledging that Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, they emphasize the importance of weighing the pros and cons before invading another country. \n\nThe speaker believes the U.S. should leave Iraq as soon as possible, citing polls showing a strong desire for withdrawal among Iraqi citizens. They argue that if the U.S. asks the Iraqi people if they want them to stay and they say no, it would be a legitimate reason for withdrawal. While acknowledging that the U.S. will likely never be seen as \"the good guys\" in the Middle East, they believe leaving would be a step in the right direction.",
            "While progress has been made, gender discrimination persists in the United States. It's not just about women; it also affects men depending on their field. Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions due to societal biases. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home can be judged and stereotyped. In industries like fashion, men may be met with skepticism because of preconceived notions about masculinity.  However, gradual change is occurring. More women are attaining leadership positions, stay-at-home dads are becoming more accepted, and society is slowly challenging traditional gender roles. While change is slow, continued efforts to highlight the strengths and contributions of individuals regardless of gender or background are crucial.  Additionally, discrimination can stem from factors beyond gender, such as socioeconomic background or regional accents, further emphasizing the need for inclusivity and understanding.",
            "The speaker is discussing the difference between legalizing and decriminalizing marijuana. They explain that decriminalization reduces possession of marijuana from a criminal offense to a lesser offense, akin to a traffic ticket. While decriminalization removes some of the severe legal consequences associated with drug charges, it doesn't entirely eliminate future ramifications, particularly for job applications.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the financial implications of decriminalization, arguing that it can save municipalities money by reducing the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and public defenders. They suggest that cities with more liberal viewpoints, like Denver, may be more receptive to decriminalization due to the potential financial benefits, allowing them to allocate resources to other important areas like education and social programs.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that complete legalization of marijuana raises concerns about its widespread accessibility and potential negative societal impacts, comparing it to the normalization of cigarette smoking. They express apprehension about the normalization of marijuana use in public spaces and the potential for increased instances of driving under the influence.\n\nFinally, the speaker acknowledges the subjective nature of drug effects, stating that both alcohol and marijuana have adverse consequences, though they manifest differently in individuals. They emphasize the variability in people's reactions to substances, highlighting the challenges of making generalizations about their overall impact.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has both positive and negative aspects. \n\nWhile I appreciate its emphasis on tradition, I also think it's important for institutions to adapt to change. One issue I have is the Church's strict adherence to doctrine and its perceived intolerance towards those who don't perfectly conform or belong to other religions.  \n\nFor example, my parents' marriage was denied in the Catholic Church because my father was Episcopalian, which demonstrates a lack of acceptance towards other faiths. This contradicts the Catholic teaching of loving others, creating a hypocritical situation. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that some Catholic teachings are outdated and the Church clings to them despite inconsistencies with modern values. \n\nRegarding the issue of priests marrying, I believe it could be beneficial, but it likely wouldn't prevent child abuse as that is a separate issue rooted in individual behavior rather than marital status.",
            "I haven't fully formed an opinion on this issue yet, so I can't say definitively which side is right or wrong. However, I believe it's one of the most challenging topics we face today. Balancing the separation of church and state with the definition of marriage is incredibly delicate and easily leads to offense. \n\nI think all civil unions should be treated equally, regardless of religious or societal classifications.  The government shouldn't get involved in defining marriage based on religious doctrine, just as they don't for baptisms or other religious practices. If two people enter into a civil union, it should be recognized as such without further scrutiny.\n\nIdeally, if states can reach a consensus on a fair approach to same-sex marriage, they should push for federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage is excessive. The Constitution shouldn't be amended for issues that, while important to some, don't warrant such a significant change.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I find the topic of homosexuality complex. While I have many gay friends and don't condone their lifestyle, I believe same-sex marriage should be legal. I think this issue should be decided at a state level rather than nationally.  \n\nDifferent states have diverse political leanings. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage, and individuals living in those states should respect their state's decision.  \n\nUltimately, I believe all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, deserve equal opportunities.  Therefore, I support legalizing same-sex marriage based on the discretion of each state.  \n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I don't believe he should impose his views on the entire country, as each state has the right to govern itself.  \n\nFurthermore, the political landscape is constantly changing. If a future president lifts the ban, it will create a back-and-forth situation. It's more sensible to let each state decide on this issue, as they will be the ones living with the consequences.",
            "The speaker believes that Myspace being a public platform means that school officials have the right to access student posts, even if they aren't using the school's name. They argue that since anything on the internet is accessible, students should expect their posts to be seen by others, including school officials.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges that searching for information about student misconduct is an invasion of privacy, but justifies school officials' actions if it prevents harm or improves school safety. They compare it to the measures taken after the terrorist attacks, where drills and security measures were implemented to ensure student safety. Ultimately, the speaker concludes that school officials' actions, though potentially controversial, are justifiable if they aim to prevent tragedies like Columbine.",
            "Initially, I supported the war on Iraq because of the personal impact of 9/11. I felt strongly about inflicting the same pain they caused us. However, I believe the intense emotions surrounding the event led to overlooking long-term consequences and a lack of preparedness. We went in without a clear plan and, in my view, it backfired.\n\nWhile I initially supported the war, I'm now strongly against it. I don't see it accomplishing anything.  If the Iraqi people continue to be divided, they won't be able to effectively fight us. I've become emotionally detached from the situation, feeling a lack of empathy for the people involved.\n\nI realize we went into the war unprepared, unaware of the challenges we would face. Their approach to war is vastly different from ours; they are more brutal and seem driven by a desire to expel us rather than improve their country.\n\nI believe we should withdraw and let them resolve their own issues. The initial motivation seemed to be revenge, fueled by public sentiment and President Bush's desire to act decisively. \n\nAlthough I understand the need to respond to the attacks, I believe we should have had a more comprehensive plan. There was a lack of unity and clear objectives, which ultimately hindered our efforts.\n\nI think we went in driven by anger and emotion, which has only perpetuated the conflict. I don't believe we are capable of changing their culture or values. Progress has been made, but not enough to justify our continued presence. I fear that once we leave, the situation will collapse, and our prolonged involvement is ultimately self-defeating."
