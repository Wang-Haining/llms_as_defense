            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there is no valid reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are so many factors to consider that it cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin - heads can never be tails, but they are essentially the same. There are various civil rights associated with this, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner cannot be present if you are sick, as they are not technically considered family. I think this is absurd if you are spending the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. What many people seem to get hung up on is that homosexuals are not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather a legal marriage certificate provided by the government. If there is no involvement with church and state, this shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why people like Catholics would object to this on religious grounds, as it is a legal matter. If you are allowing someone a civil union, why not also allow them a legal marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should reflect this. However, I think President Bush has strong views on this matter, and his stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard against it are moral, but morality differs from person to person. To embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while considering recent controversies such as the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but this is not a valid reason. The American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue. Institutions that actually do research should be listened to instead of popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties. So, I’d say no to making it available to the public. Absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I’d say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it’s beneficial; it’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial. And if you deny that, just because there’s a taboo around marijuana, then there’s no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things. It’s a tough one. I’d say you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused, but if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it’s an illegal drug. But I mean, it’s not that bad for you. It’s not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I remember growing up, I would always go to church every Sunday and wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there on the weekends. Now, as I've gotten older, they've started a teenager's mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during the summer. Families often come in late, so I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to get dressed up, people now wear jeans and khakis. I think the biggest change I've noticed is that the church I know doesn't involve me in its politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by changing policies like allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. It's the individual, not the policies. I think that if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should consider a different faith. The sexuality of these priests might be based on genetics, not how they were brought up. I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening if they didn't know about it and were trying to cover it up. Shame on them if they did know and didn't act. As for other thoughts, I don't have any.",
            "(laughs)\n\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still very much shaken by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq based on flimsy pretexts. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still upsets me. It seems to me that the Bush administration was very open about deceiving the American people and has yet to take responsibility. Even Colin Powell, who later admitted that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the UN, called it a mistake.\n\nThat’s an impeachable offense, in my opinion. The Bush administration has shown complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of office, but it seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his father’s administration. I think he also aimed to secure our energy supply, which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI think we should have pulled out a long time ago. Pulling out now could lead to a civil war, which would result in more deaths. The alternative proposed by the UN and the US, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the best idea because it could also lead to long-term issues regarding Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, and the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister lacks control, and radical elements are vying for power.",

Und ich denke, es war eher eine große Reaktion gegen den Irak, weil man annahm, dass er die USA angegriffen hat. Wie die Terroristen, die die Anschläge am 11. September verübt haben. Also, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak, also halte ich mich nicht auf dem Laufenden. Ich kenne die großen Details nicht, aber ich weiß, dass wir dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, die Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es so etwas wie die USA wird, und außerdem, um Öl und so weiter von ihnen zu bekommen. Aber das ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt. Also, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann müssen wir versuchen, die Demokratie zu schaffen, was sowieso ewig dauern wird, da man Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufbauen kann. Und wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen von vorne anfangen. Um, lass mich sehen, oh, das ist so schwer. Das ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß. Um, Krieg im Irak. Oh, das ist schwer. Uh. Mmm. Uhh, ich weiß nicht. Hast du noch etwas anderes, über das ich sprechen könnte? Ok. Danke. Um. Also, ich denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist. Ich denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen. Aber, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen, dass wir stark und Amerikaner sind und so weiter. Aber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund dafür gibt, es noch als Krieg zu bezeichnen, weil es sowieso nie erklärt wurde. Man muss den Krieg vom Kongress erklären, und dann ist es, dass ich denke, dass es das nicht mehr wert ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen. Aber es ist auch, als ob wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden. Und besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob er wie einer der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussieht, weil von dem, was es tut, und es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob. Und dann, erinnere dich an die ganze Vietnam-Sache, der Vietnam-Krieg war ein undeclared war und ist jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet. Und er wird wahrscheinlich so bezeichnet werden, als einer der Präsidenten, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg begann und so weiter. Also, huh, du musst eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? Uh, Ok ja, um, huh, ich schätze, du könntest auch sagen, dass es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden will, weil es so viele Familien gibt, die ich kenne, deren Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind, und es ist so, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, wegen der Tatsache, dass du weißt, dass du die Menschen dort leben lässt und wir haben sie zerstört, weil wir sie jetzt dort haben und ich denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr ein Schulgebäude, weil es so unsicher ist und all die kleinen Gruppen innerhalb von Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten, nur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben. Aber dann wieder ist es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, ich will sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie mehr und mehr zu uns zu formen, und es wird noch schlimmer für sie werden, und es wird so sein, dass ich denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegen die USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern, und sie haben so lange eine totalitäre Diktatur gehabt, dass ich denke, dass es uns am Ende schadet, wenn wir dort bleiben.

I feel that attempting to impose any kind of power over this issue would be against what has already been written in the constitution. I believe those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in areas like Boston. I don’t think it’s the government’s place to decide what churches can and can’t make illegal. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Even if an amendment were to be made, I think it would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. I really feel it’s up to the churches, not the president or anyone in government, to decide this. There isn’t a good reason for an amendment banning it, as I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society positively.",
            "Ok, the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government exploited the public's outrage against the attacks to push for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI myself am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, is reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the high number of American soldiers who died. They removed Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. The United States was attempting to install a democratic government, similar to their efforts in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and duration of the process.\n\nI believe the government was not adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We are still there, at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. The long process of training Iraqi troops and police forces is ongoing. The government may have tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. Implementing a new form of government takes years and is not an easy process, as seen in our own history.\n\nThe decision to go to war is difficult. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken away their government and way of life. However, we also need to consider the high risk and cost to American lives. Moreover, if the goal is to create a democratic nation, why just Iraq? The main reason is likely oil, as it's a significant source of our energy. The government's claims of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false, unlike in the case of North Korea, where we know they exist but have not attacked.\n\nI hope that this war ends soon and that there will be peace, but I doubt that will happen.",

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged for too long. Initially, the purpose was good, which was to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have lost sight of that purpose and are now fighting for the sake of proving our power. I think the original motivation had questionable aspects, such as George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be justifiable, but if personal matters were involved, it would not be fair. I believe the war has been prolonged too much. Initially, starting the war was a clear statement, but it has dragged on for over a year now. If our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I don't think our reason has remained consistent over time; it seems we are still at war just to be at war, and we don't want to leave without a decisive victory. I think the war has gone on long enough and should stop. There comes a point when the country's officials must fend for themselves. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions of dollars on this war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty. This war is a long-term drain on our economy. We should be spending that money on improving our own country, such as fixing roads and schools, and addressing healthcare issues. Right now, that money is being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it was reduced from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—something you might get cited for instead of being booked and arrested. When someone gets caught and cited for it, there are still potential ramifications, such as issues with job interviews and other formal situations, which are usually the worst effects of a drug charge. At least with a marijuana charge, people often worry about these long-term effects, even if it's decriminalized.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that arresting and processing people can be expensive. It involves costs for booking, housing, court proceedings, and legal representation. Municipalities facing financial difficulties might not be willing to take on these additional expenses, even if it could free up funding for other public needs. In a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might be accepted. Here, the city might have more money to spend on education, social programs, and food assistance for the homeless due to the financial benefits.\n\nI don't think everyone wants marijuana to be widely available and smoked everywhere, as it could be awkward and not socially accepted in many places. Additionally, it's hard to generalize about the effects of substances like marijuana and alcohol. They both have adverse effects on people, and individuals react differently based on their personal characteristics. Some people might use substances moderately, while others might not. Ultimately, both substances can have negative impacts, but how they affect each other can vary greatly from person to person.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of the things they do are very traditional. They've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. That’s not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So because it’s just a different realm. I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",

However, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel that it should be decided by each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you should disagree with a state's decision if they choose to legalize it, as you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel like it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI've already answered that. But I don't feel like Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush lives in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was in favor of going over there and creating as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was in favor of it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike I don’t think our presence over there is going to do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were going to face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because for them, war is very different than for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there is no valid reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are so many factors to consider that it cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin - heads can never be tails, but they are essentially the same. There are various civil rights associated with this, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner cannot be present if you are sick, as they are not technically considered family. I think this is absurd if you are spending the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. What many people seem to get hung up on is that homosexuals are not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather a legal marriage certificate provided by the government. If there is no involvement with church and state, this shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why people like Catholics would object to this on religious grounds, as it is a legal matter. If you are allowing someone a civil union, why not also allow them a legal marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should reflect this. However, I think President Bush has strong views on this matter, and his stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard against it are moral, but morality differs from person to person. To embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while considering recent controversies such as the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but this is not a valid reason. The American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue. Institutions that actually do research should be listened to instead of popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties. So, I’d say no to making it available to the public. Absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I’d say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it’s beneficial; it’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial. And if you deny that, just because there’s a taboo around marijuana, then there’s no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things. It’s a tough one. I’d say you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused, but if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it’s an illegal drug. But I mean, it’s not that bad for you. It’s not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I remember growing up, I would always go to church every Sunday and wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there on the weekends. Now, as I've gotten older, they've started a teenager's mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during the summer. Families often come in late, so I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to get dressed up, people now wear jeans and khakis. I think the biggest change I've noticed is that the church I know doesn't involve me in its politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by changing policies like allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. It's the individual, not the policies. I think that if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should consider a different faith. The sexuality of these priests might be based on genetics, not how they were brought up. I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening if they didn't know about it and were trying to cover it up. Shame on them if they did know and didn't act. As for other thoughts, I don't have any.",
            "(laughs)\n\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still very much shaken by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq based on flimsy pretexts. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still upsets me. It seems to me that the Bush administration was very open about deceiving the American people and has yet to take responsibility. Even Colin Powell, who later admitted that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the UN, called it a mistake.\n\nThat’s an impeachable offense, in my opinion. The Bush administration has shown complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of office, but it seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his father’s administration. I think he also aimed to secure our energy supply, which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI think we should have pulled out a long time ago. Pulling out now could lead to a civil war, which would result in more deaths. The alternative proposed by the UN and the US, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the best idea because it could also lead to long-term issues regarding Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, and the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister lacks control, and radical elements are vying for power.",

Tut mir leid\nOk\nWie ich über den Krieg im Irak denke\nLass mich sehen\nUm\nAn diesem Punkt fühle ich, dass es eher sinnlos ist, weil ich meine, es wurde ja gar nicht wirklich erklärt. Und ich denke, es war eher eine große Reaktion gegen den Irak, weil man annahm, dass er die USA angegriffen hat. Wie die Terroristen, die die Anschläge am 11. September verübt haben. Also, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak, also halte ich mich nicht auf dem Laufenden. Ich kenne die großen Details nicht, aber ich weiß, dass wir dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, die Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es so etwas wie die USA wird, und außerdem, um Öl und so weiter von ihnen zu bekommen. Aber das ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt. Also, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann müssen wir versuchen, die Demokratie zu schaffen, was sowieso ewig dauern wird, da man Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufbauen kann. Und wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen von vorne anfangen. Um, lass mich sehen, oh, das ist so schwer. Das ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß. Um, Krieg im Irak. Oh, das ist schwer. Uh. Mmm. Uhh, ich weiß nicht. Hast du noch etwas anderes, über das ich sprechen könnte? Ok. Danke. Um. Also, ich denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist. Ich denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen. Aber, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen, dass wir stark und Amerikaner sind und so weiter. Aber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund dafür gibt, es noch als Krieg zu bezeichnen, weil es sowieso nie erklärt wurde. Man muss den Krieg vom Kongress erklären, und dann ist es, dass ich denke, dass es das nicht mehr wert ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen. Aber es ist auch, als ob wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden. Und besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob er wie einer der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussieht, weil von dem, was es tut, und es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob. Und dann, erinnere dich an die ganze Vietnam-Sache, der Vietnam-Krieg war ein undeclared war und ist jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet. Und er wird wahrscheinlich so bezeichnet werden, als einer der Präsidenten, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg begann und so weiter. Also, huh, du musst eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? Uh, Ok ja, um, huh, ich schätze, du könntest auch sagen, dass es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden will, weil es so viele Familien gibt, die ich kenne, deren Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind, und es ist so, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, wegen der Tatsache, dass du weißt, dass du die Menschen dort leben lässt und wir haben sie zerstört, weil wir sie jetzt dort haben und ich denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr ein Schulgebäude, weil es so unsicher ist und all die kleinen Gruppen innerhalb von Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten, nur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben. Aber dann wieder ist es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, ich will sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie mehr und mehr zu uns zu formen, und es wird noch schlimmer für sie werden, und es wird so sein, dass ich denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegen die USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern, und sie haben so lange eine totalitäre Diktatur gehabt, dass ich denke, dass es uns am Ende schadet, wenn wir dort bleiben.

            "I really don’t feel that it’s appropriate to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. I think it’s up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I feel that attempting to impose any kind of power over this issue would be against what has already been written in the constitution. I believe those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in areas like Boston. I don’t think it’s the government’s place to decide what churches can and can’t make illegal. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Even if an amendment were to be made, I think it would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. I really feel it’s up to the churches, not the president or anyone in government, to decide this. There isn’t a good reason for an amendment banning it, as I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society positively.",
            "Ok, the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government exploited the public's outrage against the attacks to push for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI myself am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, is reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the high number of American soldiers who died. They removed Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. The United States was attempting to install a democratic government, similar to their efforts in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and duration of the process.\n\nI believe the government was not adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We are still there, at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. The long process of training Iraqi troops and police forces is ongoing. The government may have tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. Implementing a new form of government takes years and is not an easy process, as seen in our own history.\n\nThe decision to go to war is difficult. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken away their government and way of life. However, we also need to consider the high risk and cost to American lives. Moreover, if the goal is to create a democratic nation, why just Iraq? The main reason is likely oil, as it's a significant source of our energy. The government's claims of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false, unlike in the case of North Korea, where we know they exist but have not attacked.\n\nI hope that this war ends soon and that there will be peace, but I doubt that will happen.",

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged for too long. Initially, the purpose was good, which was to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have lost sight of that purpose and are now fighting for the sake of proving our power. I think the original motivation had questionable aspects, such as George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be justifiable, but if personal matters were involved, it would not be fair. I believe the war has been prolonged too much. Initially, starting the war was a clear statement, but it has dragged on for over a year now. If our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I don't think our reason has remained consistent over time; it seems we are still at war just to be at war, and we don't want to leave without a decisive victory. I think the war has gone on long enough and should stop. There comes a point when the country's officials must fend for themselves. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions of dollars on this war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty. This war is a long-term drain on our economy. We should be spending that money on improving our own country, such as fixing roads and schools, and addressing healthcare issues. Right now, that money is being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOk\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their friend or something like that.\nBut you've given them permission to see your profile.\nSo whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\nUm\nI mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation they came across.\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm\nThis man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily.\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me.\nAnd it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like.\nSometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don't want to limit it too much.\nSo it's a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo...\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think\nI don't really know how they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it was reduced from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—something you might get cited for instead of being booked and arrested. When someone gets caught and cited for it, there are still potential ramifications, such as issues with job interviews and other formal situations, which are usually the worst effects of a drug charge. At least with a marijuana charge, people often worry about these long-term effects, even if it's decriminalized.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that arresting and processing people can be expensive. It involves costs for booking, housing, court proceedings, and legal representation. Municipalities facing financial difficulties might not be willing to take on these additional expenses, even if it could free up funding for other public needs. In a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might be accepted. Here, the city might have more money to spend on education, social programs, and food assistance for the homeless due to the financial benefits.\n\nI don't think everyone wants marijuana to be widely available and smoked everywhere, as it could be awkward and not socially accepted in many places. Additionally, it's hard to generalize about the effects of substances like marijuana and alcohol. They both have adverse effects on people, and individuals react differently based on their personal characteristics. Some people might use substances moderately, while others might not. Ultimately, both substances can have negative impacts, but how they affect each other can vary greatly from person to person.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of the things they do are very traditional. They've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. That’s not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So because it’s just a different realm. I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",

            "I was raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel that it should be decided by each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you should disagree with a state's decision if they choose to legalize it, as you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel like it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI've already answered that. But I don't feel like Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush lives in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was in favor of going over there and creating as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was in favor of it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike I don’t think our presence over there is going to do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were going to face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because for them, war is very different than for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there is no valid reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are so many factors to consider that it cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin - heads can never be tails, but they are essentially the same. There are various civil rights associated with this, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner cannot be present if you are sick, as they are not technically considered family. I think this is absurd if you are spending the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. What many people seem to get hung up on is that homosexuals are not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather a legal marriage certificate provided by the government. If there is no involvement with church and state, this shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why people like Catholics would object to this on religious grounds, as it is a legal matter. If you are allowing someone a civil union, why not also allow them a legal marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should reflect this. However, I think President Bush has strong views on this matter, and his stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard against it are moral, but morality differs from person to person. To embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while considering recent controversies such as the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but this is not a valid reason. The American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue. Institutions that actually do research should be listened to instead of popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties. So, I’d say no to making it available to the public. Absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I’d say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it’s beneficial; it’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial. And if you deny that, just because there’s a taboo around marijuana, then there’s no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things. It’s a tough one. I’d say you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused, but if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it’s an illegal drug. But I mean, it’s not that bad for you. It’s not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I remember growing up, I would always go to church every Sunday and wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there on the weekends. Now, as I've gotten older, they've started a teenager's mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during the summer. Families often come in late, so I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to get dressed up, people now wear jeans and khakis. I think the biggest change I've noticed is that the church I know doesn't involve me in its politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by changing policies like allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. It's the individual, not the policies. I think that if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should consider a different faith. The sexuality of these priests might be based on genetics, not how they were brought up. I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening if they didn't know about it and were trying to cover it up. Shame on them if they did know and didn't act. As for other thoughts, I don't have any.",
            "(laughs)\n\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still very much shaken by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq based on flimsy pretexts. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still upsets me. It seems to me that the Bush administration was very open about deceiving the American people and has yet to take responsibility. Even Colin Powell, who later admitted that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the UN, called it a mistake.\n\nThat’s an impeachable offense, in my opinion. The Bush administration has shown complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of office, but it seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his father’s administration. I think he also aimed to secure our energy supply, which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI think we should have pulled out a long time ago. Pulling out now could lead to a civil war, which would result in more deaths. The alternative proposed by the UN and the US, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the best idea because it could also lead to long-term issues regarding Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, and the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister lacks control, and radical elements are vying for power.",

Tut mir leid\nOk\nWie ich über den Krieg im Irak denke\nLass mich sehen\nUm\nAn diesem Punkt fühle ich, dass es eher sinnlos ist, weil ich meine, es wurde ja gar nicht wirklich erklärt. Und ich denke, es war eher eine große Reaktion gegen den Irak, weil man annahm, dass er die USA angegriffen hat. Wie die Terroristen, die die Anschläge am 11. September verübt haben. Also, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak, also halte ich mich nicht auf dem Laufenden. Ich kenne die großen Details nicht, aber ich weiß, dass wir dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, die Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es so etwas wie die USA wird, und außerdem, um Öl und so weiter von ihnen zu bekommen. Aber das ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt. Also, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann müssen wir versuchen, die Demokratie zu schaffen, was sowieso ewig dauern wird, da man Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufbauen kann. Und wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen von vorne anfangen. Um, lass mich sehen, oh, das ist so schwer. Das ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß. Um, Krieg im Irak. Oh, das ist schwer. Uh. Mmm. Uhh, ich weiß nicht. Hast du noch etwas anderes, über das ich sprechen könnte? Ok. Danke. Um. Also, ich denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist. Ich denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen. Aber, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen, dass wir stark und Amerikaner sind und so weiter. Aber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund dafür gibt, es noch als Krieg zu bezeichnen, weil es sowieso nie erklärt wurde. Man muss den Krieg vom Kongress erklären, und dann ist es, dass ich denke, dass es das nicht mehr wert ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen. Aber es ist auch, als ob wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden. Und besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob er wie einer der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussieht, weil von dem, was es tut, und es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob. Und dann, erinnere dich an die ganze Vietnam-Sache, der Vietnam-Krieg war ein undeclared war und ist jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet. Und er wird wahrscheinlich so bezeichnet werden, als einer der Präsidenten, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg begann und so weiter. Also, huh, du musst eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? Uh, Ok ja, um, huh, ich schätze, du könntest auch sagen, dass es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden will, weil es so viele Familien gibt, die ich kenne, deren Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind, und es ist so, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, wegen der Tatsache, dass du weißt, dass du die Menschen dort leben lässt und wir haben sie zerstört, weil wir sie jetzt dort haben und ich denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr ein Schulgebäude, weil es so unsicher ist und all die kleinen Gruppen innerhalb von Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten, nur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben. Aber dann wieder ist es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, ich will sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie mehr und mehr zu uns zu formen, und es wird noch schlimmer für sie werden, und es wird so sein, dass ich denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegen die USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern, und sie haben so lange eine totalitäre Diktatur gehabt, dass ich denke, dass es uns am Ende schadet, wenn wir dort bleiben.

            "I really don’t feel that it’s appropriate to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. I think it’s up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I feel that attempting to impose any kind of power over this issue would be against what has already been written in the constitution. I believe those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in areas like Boston. I don’t think it’s the government’s place to decide what churches can and can’t make illegal. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Even if an amendment were to be made, I think it would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. I really feel it’s up to the churches, not the president or anyone in government, to decide this. There isn’t a good reason for an amendment banning it, as I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society positively.",
            "Ok, the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government exploited the public's outrage against the attacks to push for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI myself am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, is reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the high number of American soldiers who died. They removed Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. The United States was attempting to install a democratic government, similar to their efforts in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and duration of the process.\n\nI believe the government was not adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We are still there, at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. The long process of training Iraqi troops and police forces is ongoing. The government may have tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. Implementing a new form of government takes years and is not an easy process, as seen in our own history.\n\nThe decision to go to war is difficult. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken away their government and way of life. However, we also need to consider the high risk and cost to American lives. Moreover, if the goal is to create a democratic nation, why just Iraq? The main reason is likely oil, as it's a significant source of our energy. The government's claims of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false, unlike in the case of North Korea, where we know they exist but have not attacked.\n\nI hope that this war ends soon and that there will be peace, but I doubt that will happen.",

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged for too long. Initially, the purpose was good, which was to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have lost sight of that purpose and are now fighting for the sake of proving our power. I think the original motivation had questionable aspects, such as George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be justifiable, but if personal matters were involved, it would not be fair. I believe the war has been prolonged too much. Initially, starting the war was a clear statement, but it has dragged on for over a year now. If our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I don't think our reason has remained consistent over time; it seems we are still at war just to be at war, and we don't want to leave without a decisive victory. I think the war has gone on long enough and should stop. There comes a point when the country's officials must fend for themselves. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions of dollars on this war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty. This war is a long-term drain on our economy. We should be spending that money on improving our own country, such as fixing roads and schools, and addressing healthcare issues. Right now, that money is being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOk\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their friend or something like that.\nBut you've given them permission to see your profile.\nSo whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\nUm\nI mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation they came across.\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm\nThis man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily.\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me.\nAnd it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like.\nSometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don't want to limit it too much.\nSo it's a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo...\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think\nI don't really know how they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it was reduced from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—something you might get cited for instead of being booked and arrested. When someone gets caught and cited for it, there are still potential ramifications, such as issues with job interviews and other formal situations, which are usually the worst effects of a drug charge. At least with a marijuana charge, people often worry about these long-term effects, even if it's decriminalized.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that arresting and processing people can be expensive. It involves costs for booking, housing, court proceedings, and legal representation. Municipalities facing financial difficulties might not be willing to take on these additional expenses, even if it could free up funding for other public needs. In a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might be accepted. Here, the city might have more money to spend on education, social programs, and food assistance for the homeless due to the financial benefits.\n\nI don't think everyone wants marijuana to be widely available and smoked everywhere, as it could be awkward and not socially accepted in many places. Additionally, it's hard to generalize about the effects of substances like marijuana and alcohol. They both have adverse effects on people, and individuals react differently based on their personal characteristics. Some people might use substances moderately, while others might not. Ultimately, both substances can have negative impacts, but how they affect each other can vary greatly from person to person.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of the things they do are very traditional. They've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. That’s not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So because it’s just a different realm. I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",

            "I was raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel that it should be decided by each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you should disagree with a state's decision if they choose to legalize it, as you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel like it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI've already answered that. But I don't feel like Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush lives in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was in favor of going over there and creating as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was in favor of it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike I don’t think our presence over there is going to do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were going to face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because for them, war is very different than for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are somewhat outdated, and many people are turning away from it. For instance, the Church is not very accepting of topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These strong views can be seen as old-fashioned. If the Church adapted to more modern thinking, it might not face a loss of followers. I've heard that many people are unsatisfied with the Church's stance on these issues. They feel that the Church's views are incorrect. For example, if someone supports abortion and wants to stay within the Church, it might make them uncomfortable if the Church teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for same-sex marriage. People might not want to follow a religion that disagrees with their personal beliefs. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why women can't become priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the current situation. It's hard to say if priests would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I don't see why they can't also have a family life. It's perplexing that priests can't balance their job and their personal life like everyone else.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I think that whether you're born that way or not, it's not a choice. I don't think people, like gay people, should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given the topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. It's not like they have a choice in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight and another person could be born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I wouldn't think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interject in people's lives. That's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nAs\nThere's no good reason not to\nIn essence\nMany people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family\nBut\nIt's so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same\nIt's just\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt's like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are several civil rights that come with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the entire health care issue where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don't want to say next of kin\nBecause I'm not sure that's what it is\nBut\nIf you're in a same-sex couple, then your partner can't be with you if you're sick\nAnd\nCan't visit\nBecause they're not technically family\n\nAnd\nI think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt's a hot topic these days\nAnd\nSame-sex couples have the same rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\n\nIt's just that it's a relationship it's the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people get hung up on is\nUm\nSame-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey're asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\n\nAnd\nIf there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue\nBecause\nI can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on saying that it's against their religion and is morally wrong for them and they can't approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage\n\nIt's like segregation separate but unequal\n\nYeah\nThey are\nThey're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a same-sex couple living in their community will affect the community\n\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of same-sex couples and how they'll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they'll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent's\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it's kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt's kind of hard to say\nI'm not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\n\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of same-sex parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\n\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt's just a kid\nI mean\nThey're gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in same-sex couples as in straight couples\n\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it's just about personality choices\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking same-sex marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\n\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\n\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on same-sex marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI'm not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don't want to say it's negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning same-sex marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder God in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\n\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\n\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what's popular opinion in their

            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and we kind of went into Iraq under the pretext that there were reasons to do so. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false.\nAnd that really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just infuriates me.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell—coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that’s just malfeasance in office. I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11th, at least.\nI think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part—\nI forget the name of the secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nBut it seems like the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell,\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue—\nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr—\nI guess it was less than a year ago—\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",

September\nAlso, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak\nDeshalb halte ich mich auch nicht auf dem Laufenden\nIch kenne die großen Details nicht\nAber an diesem Punkt weiß ich, dass wir da bleiben, um zu versuchen, eine Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie ein weiteres US-Ding wird\nUnd um dann auch Öl von ihnen zu bekommen\nAber es ist kein Grund, da zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt\nUnd dann, wenn wir da bleiben, müssen wir versuchen, Demokratie zu schaffen, was Jahre dauern wird, weil Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufgebaut werden kann\nUnd wenn wir gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen jetzt wieder von vorne anfangen\nUm\nLass mich nachdenken\nOh, das ist so schwer\nDas ist das Thema, über das ich am wenigsten weiß\nUm\nKrieg im Irak\nOh, das ist schwer\nMhmm\nUhh, ich weiß nicht\nHast du noch etwas anderes, das ich verwenden kann?\nOk\nDanke\nUm\nAlso, ich denke\nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es unfair ist\nIch denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr Krieg nennen\nAber weil ich denke\nAlso, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen\nAlso, dass wir groß und Amerikanisch sind und so weiter und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben\nAber ich denke, es gibt keinen großen Grund mehr, es weiter zu nennen\nWeil es ja auch nie als Krieg erklärt wurde\nWeil es immer noch keine Kriegserklärung durch den Kongress gegeben hat\nIch denke, so funktioniert das\nMan muss eine Kriegserklärung durch den Kongress geben\nUnd dann ist es\nIch denke, es ist kein großer Punkt, noch länger zu bleiben und zu versuchen\nNein, ich denke, es ist ein Punkt, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen\nAber es ist auch Verschwendung von Ressourcen\nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist\nEs macht ihn zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA\nWeil von dem, was es da tut und was es mit den Menschen macht\nUnd das ist\nWeil ich mit dem Vietnamkrieg denken\nDer Vietnamkrieg war auch kein grundgesetzlicher Krieg und wird jetzt als bedeutungsloser Krieg bezeichnet\nUnd er ist wie\nEr wird als der Präsident bezeichnet, der diesen bedeutungslosen Krieg gestartet hat und so weiter\nAlso\nHm\nMüsste das nicht eine halbe Stunde dauern?\nMhmm\nOk ja\nUm\nHm\nIch denke, du könntest auch sagen, dass es\nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich möchte, dass der Krieg endet, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass ihre Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind und es ist so, dass ich möchte, dass er weitergeht, weil\nDiese Menschen dort haben auch ein Leben und wir haben es zerstört, weil wir es jetzt den\nIch denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr einen Ort, an dem sie zur Schule gehen können, weil es so unsicher ist und all diese kleinen Gruppen in Irak, die sich gegenseitig umbringen\nNur weil sie verschiedene Überzeugungen haben\nAber dann wieder\nEs ist einfach\nEs ist schwer zu sagen\nIch möchte sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, wir versuchen werden, sie mehr und mehr zu formen wie eine zweite USA zu sein\nDas wird noch schlimmer für sie sein\nUnd es wird\nIch denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegenüber den USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu verändern\nUnd sie haben so lange eine totalitäre\nEin ganzes Diktaturding\nDass\nIch denke, das wird uns am Ende nur noch schaden\nIch denke, das Ganze wird noch Jahre und Jahre und Jahre dauern\nHmm\nDas ist so weit\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel that\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on the society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok.\nThe war in Iraq.\nWell,\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality had little to do with each other. But the government made it seem otherwise and played on the emotions of the American people still outraged by the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\nUm,\nI,\nI myself am generally against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing is that they were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued. And here, the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, a similar thing they tried to do in Vietnam by pushing out Communists and upholding democracy.\nBut it's not going to be a clear victory like it wasn’t in Vietnam because there are insurgents, and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting citizens.\nSo, I think first of all, we shouldn’t have gotten into war in the first place, cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you’re going to go to war with a country, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government wasn’t prepared enough for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to police their own country. It’s a long process.\nI think the U.S. government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about that because implementing a new form of government takes years, and it’s not an easy thing to do. It was a long struggle in our own country to get to the powerful government we are today, with lots of tension and even civil war.\nSo, the war in Iraq, it’s a difficult decision. It was kind of my feeling in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for. One of my reasons to vote for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. But once you go in, how can you abandon them? We took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see through to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical number of American casualties.\nI mean, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why just Iraq? Why not all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue, and this is where we’re getting our oil from. It’s usually about money and controlling resources.\nAnd another thing to consider is that before going into war, it was said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons were ever found. Places like North Korea, we know they have weapons of mass destruction, but we’re not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the U.S. government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "When you post something online, it enters a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control what others think or do. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this. When you put something out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you're talking about destruction or shootings, someone might react. You can't put that out there for the world to see. The internet is accessible to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you might receive a bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin; someone went to the school and reported it. They have to act on it, because if they don't and something happens, they could have prevented it. However, you don't know what to take seriously, because some people just joke around. Like in our school, it could have been a sociology project gone wrong. I mean, what happened was someone overheard something in the school and reported it. When we found out who the person was, a friend of his checked his Facebook and got worried because there were some concerning messages. In light of the situation, it became serious. When you put something online, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. You can't control what others think or find. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook. But if something is brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, I don't think they should monitor phone conversations and texts. But if something is brought to their attention, it's a different story. Like a teacher shouldn't create a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and befriend students. That's the same as not wanting to know your residents if they go out and drink and post pictures on Facebook. It's not my place to know that, so I don't want that connection.",

            "Um\nYes, I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women, though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work you’re in.\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it harder because there’s the glass ceiling where, despite the supposed equality, many people have difficulty working under a woman if they are a man.\nJust because society has been that way for so long.\nAnd so, often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but maybe the board won’t promote them to that position just because historically, it’s not seen that women are typically in the upper echelons of the business world.\nAnd um\nI guess the same thing goes for men, too.\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a parent at home,\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent at home who is male.\nAnd um\nA lot of times, people look down upon that because society thinks, \"Well, you’re the male, you should be out working; you should be the money-maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\"\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like, it’s working out fine for them,\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry,\nUm\nA lot of times, people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight.\nI don’t know if that really makes sense,\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nHave different lifestyles.\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry,\nPeople will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a man?\"\nLike, you don’t really know what it’s like.\nLike these other guys.\nAnd so,\nDepending on the field of work you’re in,\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds,\nBut change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are ascending into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world, and it’s a slow process,\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads,\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\"\nAnd um\nThen for fashion people, they’ll be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff.\"\nAnd so they do know where I’m coming from.\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against without being too pushy,\nBut um, saying their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that.\nSo, I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast, it’s like people will resist.\nAnd we’ve come a long way, and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you’re from,\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself\nLike you work your way up into a CEO job,\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world,\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right?\"\nSo,\nYeah\nSo like sometimes, just where you’re from can discriminate against you,\nAnd like from gender to gender,\nAnd I don’t know,\nI guess that’d be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This moved it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket. It's something you get cited for, instead of being arrested and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, for job interviews and other things like that, the consequences which are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. However, the argument is that it costs a lot to arrest people, bring them in, book them, house them, and go through the court process. This includes paying for public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. So, when looking at financially troubled municipalities, many aren't willing to make this kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. However, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense. The municipality now has more money to spend on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's important because you don't want marijuana to be everywhere, all over the streets. There are other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized. For example, if it were completely legalized, it could be sold in gas stations, and people would be smoking it everywhere. That could lead to a lot of people smoking and driving, which is still taboo in many places. I also feel that it would be awkward for people. In terms of their effects, alcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana has a more adverse effect on one's lifestyle. Both have their adverse effects, and no two people react the same way. Some people exercise moderation, while others don't. It makes it hard to generalize about the substance because people react differently. However, I definitely think they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nWell\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\n\nAnd\nWell\nIt’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nWell\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I don’t have a clear opinion on this issue yet, so I can’t say if one side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is the most complicated topic we’re facing today. Something so close to the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage, is very tricky.\n\nI don’t know, I think that all civil unions, I don’t know whether marriage should be viewed in the same way, and defined by the government, seeing as it’s considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn’t get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government if they were baptized. So, if you’re married, I think they should just view it as a civil union, because that’s what it is. It’s two people united together. So, and the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it’s just that two people have a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. Simply put.\n\nUh, no.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something that each state decides on its own. The president shouldn’t decide for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. You chose to live there, so you shouldn’t disagree with that decision if the state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don’t think the president should decide for the entire country. I don’t agree with his ban on it. He doesn’t live in every state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’ll be out of office in a couple of years. If a democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t think so\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it because I was affected by 9/11 personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think our being over there is gonna do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are somewhat outdated, and many people are turning away from it. For instance, the Church is not very accepting of topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These strong views can be seen as old-fashioned. If the Church adapted to more modern thinking, it might not face a loss of followers. I've heard that many people are unsatisfied with the Church's stance on these issues. They feel that the Church's views are incorrect. For example, if someone supports abortion and wants to stay within the Church, it might make them uncomfortable if the Church teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for same-sex marriage. People might not want to follow a religion that disagrees with their personal beliefs. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why women can't become priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the current situation. It's hard to say if priests would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I don't see why they can't also have a family life. It's perplexing that priests can't balance their job and their personal life like everyone else.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I think that whether you're born that way or not, it's not a choice. I don't think people, like gay people, should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given the topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. It's not like they have a choice in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight and another person could be born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I wouldn't think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interject in people's lives. That's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nAs\nThere's no good reason not to\nIn essence\nMany people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family\nBut\nIt's so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same\nIt's just\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt's like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are several civil rights that come with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the entire health care issue where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don't want to say next of kin\nBecause I'm not sure that's what it is\nBut\nIf you're in a same-sex couple, then your partner can't be with you if you're sick\nAnd\nCan't visit\nBecause they're not technically family\n\nAnd\nI think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt's a hot topic these days\nAnd\nSame-sex couples have the same rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\n\nIt's just that it's a relationship it's the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people get hung up on is\nUm\nSame-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey're asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\n\nAnd\nIf there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue\nBecause\nI can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on saying that it's against their religion and is morally wrong for them and they can't approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage\n\nIt's like segregation separate but unequal\n\nYeah\nThey are\nThey're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a same-sex couple living in their community will affect the community\n\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of same-sex couples and how they'll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they'll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent's\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it's kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt's kind of hard to say\nI'm not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\n\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of same-sex parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\n\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt's just a kid\nI mean\nThey're gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in same-sex couples as in straight couples\n\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it's just about personality choices\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking same-sex marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\n\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\n\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on same-sex marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI'm not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don't want to say it's negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning same-sex marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder God in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\n\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\n\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what's popular opinion in their

            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and we kind of went into Iraq under the pretext that there were reasons to do so. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false.\nAnd that really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just infuriates me.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell—coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that’s just malfeasance in office. I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11th, at least.\nI think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part—\nI forget the name of the secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nBut it seems like the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell,\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue—\nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr—\nI guess it was less than a year ago—\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",

September\nAlso, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak\nDeshalb halte ich mich auch nicht auf dem Laufenden\nIch kenne die großen Details nicht\nAber an diesem Punkt weiß ich, dass wir da bleiben, um zu versuchen, eine Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie ein weiteres US-Ding wird\nUnd um dann auch Öl von ihnen zu bekommen\nAber es ist kein Grund, da zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt\nUnd dann, wenn wir da bleiben, müssen wir versuchen, Demokratie zu schaffen, was Jahre dauern wird, weil Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufgebaut werden kann\nUnd wenn wir gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen jetzt wieder von vorne anfangen\nUm\nLass mich nachdenken\nOh, das ist so schwer\nDas ist das Thema, über das ich am wenigsten weiß\nUm\nKrieg im Irak\nOh, das ist schwer\nMhmm\nUhh, ich weiß nicht\nHast du noch etwas anderes, das ich verwenden kann?\nOk\nDanke\nUm\nAlso, ich denke\nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es unfair ist\nIch denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr Krieg nennen\nAber weil ich denke\nAlso, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen\nAlso, dass wir groß und Amerikanisch sind und so weiter und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben\nAber ich denke, es gibt keinen großen Grund mehr, es weiter zu nennen\nWeil es ja auch nie als Krieg erklärt wurde\nWeil es immer noch keine Kriegserklärung durch den Kongress gegeben hat\nIch denke, so funktioniert das\nMan muss eine Kriegserklärung durch den Kongress geben\nUnd dann ist es\nIch denke, es ist kein großer Punkt, noch länger zu bleiben und zu versuchen\nNein, ich denke, es ist ein Punkt, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen\nAber es ist auch Verschwendung von Ressourcen\nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist\nEs macht ihn zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA\nWeil von dem, was es da tut und was es mit den Menschen macht\nUnd das ist\nWeil ich mit dem Vietnamkrieg denken\nDer Vietnamkrieg war auch kein grundgesetzlicher Krieg und wird jetzt als bedeutungsloser Krieg bezeichnet\nUnd er ist wie\nEr wird als der Präsident bezeichnet, der diesen bedeutungslosen Krieg gestartet hat und so weiter\nAlso\nHm\nMüsste das nicht eine halbe Stunde dauern?\nMhmm\nOk ja\nUm\nHm\nIch denke, du könntest auch sagen, dass es\nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich möchte, dass der Krieg endet, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass ihre Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind und es ist so, dass ich möchte, dass er weitergeht, weil\nDiese Menschen dort haben auch ein Leben und wir haben es zerstört, weil wir es jetzt den\nIch denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr einen Ort, an dem sie zur Schule gehen können, weil es so unsicher ist und all diese kleinen Gruppen in Irak, die sich gegenseitig umbringen\nNur weil sie verschiedene Überzeugungen haben\nAber dann wieder\nEs ist einfach\nEs ist schwer zu sagen\nIch möchte sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, wir versuchen werden, sie mehr und mehr zu formen wie eine zweite USA zu sein\nDas wird noch schlimmer für sie sein\nUnd es wird\nIch denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegenüber den USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu verändern\nUnd sie haben so lange eine totalitäre\nEin ganzes Diktaturding\nDass\nIch denke, das wird uns am Ende nur noch schaden\nIch denke, das Ganze wird noch Jahre und Jahre und Jahre dauern\nHmm\nDas ist so weit\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel that\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on the society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok.\nThe war in Iraq.\nWell,\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality had little to do with each other. But the government made it seem otherwise and played on the emotions of the American people still outraged by the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\nUm,\nI,\nI myself am generally against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing is that they were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued. And here, the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, a similar thing they tried to do in Vietnam by pushing out Communists and upholding democracy.\nBut it's not going to be a clear victory like it wasn’t in Vietnam because there are insurgents, and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting citizens.\nSo, I think first of all, we shouldn’t have gotten into war in the first place, cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you’re going to go to war with a country, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government wasn’t prepared enough for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to police their own country. It’s a long process.\nI think the U.S. government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about that because implementing a new form of government takes years, and it’s not an easy thing to do. It was a long struggle in our own country to get to the powerful government we are today, with lots of tension and even civil war.\nSo, the war in Iraq, it’s a difficult decision. It was kind of my feeling in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for. One of my reasons to vote for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. But once you go in, how can you abandon them? We took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see through to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical number of American casualties.\nI mean, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why just Iraq? Why not all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue, and this is where we’re getting our oil from. It’s usually about money and controlling resources.\nAnd another thing to consider is that before going into war, it was said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons were ever found. Places like North Korea, we know they have weapons of mass destruction, but we’re not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the U.S. government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "When you post something online, it enters a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control what others think or do. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this. When you put something out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you're talking about destruction or shootings, someone might react. You can't put that out there for the world to see. The internet is accessible to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you might receive a bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin; someone went to the school and reported it. They have to act on it, because if they don't and something happens, they could have prevented it. However, you don't know what to take seriously, because some people just joke around. Like in our school, it could have been a sociology project gone wrong. I mean, what happened was someone overheard something in the school and reported it. When we found out who the person was, a friend of his checked his Facebook and got worried because there were some concerning messages. In light of the situation, it became serious. When you put something online, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. You can't control what others think or find. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook. But if something is brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, I don't think they should monitor phone conversations and texts. But if something is brought to their attention, it's a different story. Like a teacher shouldn't create a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and befriend students. That's the same as not wanting to know your residents if they go out and drink and post pictures on Facebook. It's not my place to know that, so I don't want that connection.",

            "Um\nYes, I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women, though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work you’re in.\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it harder because there’s the glass ceiling where, despite the supposed equality, many people have difficulty working under a woman if they are a man.\nJust because society has been that way for so long.\nAnd so, often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but maybe the board won’t promote them to that position just because historically, it’s not seen that women are typically in the upper echelons of the business world.\nAnd um\nI guess the same thing goes for men, too.\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a parent at home,\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent at home who is male.\nAnd um\nA lot of times, people look down upon that because society thinks, \"Well, you’re the male, you should be out working; you should be the money-maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\"\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like, it’s working out fine for them,\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry,\nUm\nA lot of times, people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight.\nI don’t know if that really makes sense,\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nHave different lifestyles.\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry,\nPeople will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a man?\"\nLike, you don’t really know what it’s like.\nLike these other guys.\nAnd so,\nDepending on the field of work you’re in,\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds,\nBut change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are ascending into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world, and it’s a slow process,\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads,\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\"\nAnd um\nThen for fashion people, they’ll be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff.\"\nAnd so they do know where I’m coming from.\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against without being too pushy,\nBut um, saying their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that.\nSo, I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast, it’s like people will resist.\nAnd we’ve come a long way, and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you’re from,\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself\nLike you work your way up into a CEO job,\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world,\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right?\"\nSo,\nYeah\nSo like sometimes, just where you’re from can discriminate against you,\nAnd like from gender to gender,\nAnd I don’t know,\nI guess that’d be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This moved it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket. It's something you get cited for, instead of being arrested and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, for job interviews and other things like that, the consequences which are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. However, the argument is that it costs a lot to arrest people, bring them in, book them, house them, and go through the court process. This includes paying for public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. So, when looking at financially troubled municipalities, many aren't willing to make this kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. However, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense. The municipality now has more money to spend on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's important because you don't want marijuana to be everywhere, all over the streets. There are other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized. For example, if it were completely legalized, it could be sold in gas stations, and people would be smoking it everywhere. That could lead to a lot of people smoking and driving, which is still taboo in many places. I also feel that it would be awkward for people. In terms of their effects, alcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana has a more adverse effect on one's lifestyle. Both have their adverse effects, and no two people react the same way. Some people exercise moderation, while others don't. It makes it hard to generalize about the substance because people react differently. However, I definitely think they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nWell\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\n\nAnd\nWell\nIt’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nWell\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I don’t have a clear opinion on this issue yet, so I can’t say if one side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is the most complicated topic we’re facing today. Something so close to the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage, is very tricky.\n\nI don’t know, I think that all civil unions, I don’t know whether marriage should be viewed in the same way, and defined by the government, seeing as it’s considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn’t get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government if they were baptized. So, if you’re married, I think they should just view it as a civil union, because that’s what it is. It’s two people united together. So, and the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it’s just that two people have a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. Simply put.\n\nUh, no.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something that each state decides on its own. The president shouldn’t decide for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. You chose to live there, so you shouldn’t disagree with that decision if the state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don’t think the president should decide for the entire country. I don’t agree with his ban on it. He doesn’t live in every state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’ll be out of office in a couple of years. If a democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t think so\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it because I was affected by 9/11 personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think our being over there is gonna do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are somewhat outdated, and many people are turning away from it. For instance, the Church is not very accepting of topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. These strong views can be seen as old-fashioned. If the Church adapted to more modern thinking, it might not face a loss of followers. I've heard that many people are unsatisfied with the Church's stance on these issues. They feel that the Church's views are incorrect. For example, if someone supports abortion and wants to stay within the Church, it might make them uncomfortable if the Church teaches it's completely wrong. The same goes for same-sex marriage. People might not want to follow a religion that disagrees with their personal beliefs. I don't see any reason why priests can't be married or why women can't become priests. However, I'm not sure if these changes would have prevented the current situation. It's hard to say if priests would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests. The Church argues that priests are devoted to God, but I don't see why they can't also have a family life. It's perplexing that priests can't balance their job and their personal life like everyone else.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I think that whether you're born that way or not, it's not a choice. I don't think people, like gay people, should be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't given the topic much thought, but I would definitely say that's wrong. It's not like they have a choice in how they are born. I mean, I was born straight and another person could be born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I wouldn't think it's wrong to do that. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's not a legal or moral issue. It doesn't seem like they have any right to interject in people's lives. That's just who they are, and they shouldn't be punished for that. That's it.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized\nAs\nThere's no good reason not to\nIn essence\nMany people think that same-sex couples pose a threat to the traditional family\nBut\nIt's so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same\nIt's just\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt's like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are several civil rights that come with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the entire health care issue where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don't want to say next of kin\nBecause I'm not sure that's what it is\nBut\nIf you're in a same-sex couple, then your partner can't be with you if you're sick\nAnd\nCan't visit\nBecause they're not technically family\n\nAnd\nI think that's kind of silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt's a hot topic these days\nAnd\nSame-sex couples have the same rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\n\nIt's just that it's a relationship it's the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people get hung up on is\nUm\nSame-sex couples aren't asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey're asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\n\nAnd\nIf there's no involvement with church and state then that shouldn't be an issue\nBecause\nI can't understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on saying that it's against their religion and is morally wrong for them and they can't approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you're allowing someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage\n\nIt's like segregation separate but unequal\n\nYeah\nThey are\nThey're the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a same-sex couple living in their community will affect the community\n\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of same-sex couples and how they'll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they'll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent's\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it's kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt's kind of hard to say\nI'm not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\n\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of same-sex parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\n\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt's just a kid\nI mean\nThey're gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in same-sex couples as in straight couples\n\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it's just about personality choices\n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking same-sex marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\n\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\n\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on same-sex marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI'm not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I've heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don't want to say it's negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning same-sex marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder God in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they'll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\n\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\n\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what's popular opinion in their

            "(laughs)\nUm\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and we kind of went into Iraq under the pretext that there were reasons to do so. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since been proven false.\nAnd that really rubs me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war just infuriates me.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell—coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that’s just malfeasance in office. I think that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11th, at least.\nI think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part—\nI forget the name of the secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nBut it seems like the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too, which is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell,\nI do think it’s gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like\nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue—\nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr—\nI guess it was less than a year ago—\nHis party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\n\nUm\n(laughs)\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",

September\nAlso, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak\nDeshalb halte ich mich auch nicht auf dem Laufenden\nIch kenne die großen Details nicht\nAber an diesem Punkt weiß ich, dass wir da bleiben, um zu versuchen, eine Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es wie ein weiteres US-Ding wird\nUnd um dann auch Öl von ihnen zu bekommen\nAber es ist kein Grund, da zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt\nUnd dann, wenn wir da bleiben, müssen wir versuchen, Demokratie zu schaffen, was Jahre dauern wird, weil Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufgebaut werden kann\nUnd wenn wir gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen jetzt wieder von vorne anfangen\nUm\nLass mich nachdenken\nOh, das ist so schwer\nDas ist das Thema, über das ich am wenigsten weiß\nUm\nKrieg im Irak\nOh, das ist schwer\nMhmm\nUhh, ich weiß nicht\nHast du noch etwas anderes, das ich verwenden kann?\nOk\nDanke\nUm\nAlso, ich denke\nIch denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es unfair ist\nIch denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr Krieg nennen\nAber weil ich denke\nAlso, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen\nAlso, dass wir groß und Amerikanisch sind und so weiter und dass wir all diese großen Waffen haben\nAber ich denke, es gibt keinen großen Grund mehr, es weiter zu nennen\nWeil es ja auch nie als Krieg erklärt wurde\nWeil es immer noch keine Kriegserklärung durch den Kongress gegeben hat\nIch denke, so funktioniert das\nMan muss eine Kriegserklärung durch den Kongress geben\nUnd dann ist es\nIch denke, es ist kein großer Punkt, noch länger zu bleiben und zu versuchen\nNein, ich denke, es ist ein Punkt, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen\nAber es ist auch Verschwendung von Ressourcen\nUnd besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist\nEs macht ihn zu einem der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA\nWeil von dem, was es da tut und was es mit den Menschen macht\nUnd das ist\nWeil ich mit dem Vietnamkrieg denken\nDer Vietnamkrieg war auch kein grundgesetzlicher Krieg und wird jetzt als bedeutungsloser Krieg bezeichnet\nUnd er ist wie\nEr wird als der Präsident bezeichnet, der diesen bedeutungslosen Krieg gestartet hat und so weiter\nAlso\nHm\nMüsste das nicht eine halbe Stunde dauern?\nMhmm\nOk ja\nUm\nHm\nIch denke, du könntest auch sagen, dass es\nEs ist schwer zu sagen, dass ich möchte, dass der Krieg endet, weil es so viele Familien gibt, von denen ich weiß, dass ihre Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind und es ist so, dass ich möchte, dass er weitergeht, weil\nDiese Menschen dort haben auch ein Leben und wir haben es zerstört, weil wir es jetzt den\nIch denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr einen Ort, an dem sie zur Schule gehen können, weil es so unsicher ist und all diese kleinen Gruppen in Irak, die sich gegenseitig umbringen\nNur weil sie verschiedene Überzeugungen haben\nAber dann wieder\nEs ist einfach\nEs ist schwer zu sagen\nIch möchte sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, wir versuchen werden, sie mehr und mehr zu formen wie eine zweite USA zu sein\nDas wird noch schlimmer für sie sein\nUnd es wird\nIch denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegenüber den USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu verändern\nUnd sie haben so lange eine totalitäre\nEin ganzes Diktaturding\nDass\nIch denke, das wird uns am Ende nur noch schaden\nIch denke, das Ganze wird noch Jahre und Jahre und Jahre dauern\nHmm\nDas ist so weit\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel that\nIt’s right to make it legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on the society\nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok.\nThe war in Iraq.\nWell,\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was entirely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which in reality had little to do with each other. But the government made it seem otherwise and played on the emotions of the American people still outraged by the 9/11 attacks, and the invasion of Iraq began in 2003.\nUm,\nI,\nI myself am generally against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is, in many ways, a repeat of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes.\nA tremendous number of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. What they were doing is that they were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the American government was prepared for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued. And here, the United States is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, a similar thing they tried to do in Vietnam by pushing out Communists and upholding democracy.\nBut it's not going to be a clear victory like it wasn’t in Vietnam because there are insurgents, and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army, you’re fighting citizens.\nSo, I think first of all, we shouldn’t have gotten into war in the first place, cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases. But if you’re going to go to war with a country, you need to be prepared for all possible outcomes. I think the government wasn’t prepared enough for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to police their own country. It’s a long process.\nI think the U.S. government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. We shouldn’t be naïve about that because implementing a new form of government takes years, and it’s not an easy thing to do. It was a long struggle in our own country to get to the powerful government we are today, with lots of tension and even civil war.\nSo, the war in Iraq, it’s a difficult decision. It was kind of my feeling in the 2004 presidential election when I was thinking about who I would vote for. One of my reasons to vote for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. But once you go in, how can you abandon them? We took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? It’s probably something we should try to see through to its finish, but there’s also the consideration of the astronomical number of American casualties.\nI mean, if we’re invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why just Iraq? Why not all these other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue, and this is where we’re getting our oil from. It’s usually about money and controlling resources.\nAnd another thing to consider is that before going into war, it was said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but no weapons were ever found. Places like North Korea, we know they have weapons of mass destruction, but we’re not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the U.S. government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\nI just hope it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "When you post something online, it enters a public forum. It's completely public. You can't control what others think or do. As an R.A., I've had to deal with this. When you put something out there, it shapes people's opinions about you. If you're talking about destruction or shootings, someone might react. You can't put that out there for the world to see. The internet is accessible to everyone. If you're friends with someone on Myspace, you might receive a bulletin. It wasn't the school that received the bulletin; someone went to the school and reported it. They have to act on it, because if they don't and something happens, they could have prevented it. However, you don't know what to take seriously, because some people just joke around. Like in our school, it could have been a sociology project gone wrong. I mean, what happened was someone overheard something in the school and reported it. When we found out who the person was, a friend of his checked his Facebook and got worried because there were some concerning messages. In light of the situation, it became serious. When you put something online, there's no invasion of privacy. If you don't want it out there, don't put it there. You can't control what others think or find. I don't think school officials should be friends with students on Myspace and Facebook. But if something is brought to their attention, there's no invasion of privacy. If there's danger, they have to take it seriously. I mean, I don't think they should monitor phone conversations and texts. But if something is brought to their attention, it's a different story. Like a teacher shouldn't create a Facebook or Myspace account under a different name and befriend students. That's the same as not wanting to know your residents if they go out and drink and post pictures on Facebook. It's not my place to know that, so I don't want that connection.",

            "Um\nYes, I indeed feel that gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.\nUm\nAnd it\nNot only with women, though\nI feel it has to do with the specific field of work you’re in.\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it harder because there’s the glass ceiling where, despite the supposed equality, many people have difficulty working under a woman if they are a man.\nJust because society has been that way for so long.\nAnd so, often in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but maybe the board won’t promote them to that position just because historically, it’s not seen that women are typically in the upper echelons of the business world.\nAnd um\nI guess the same thing goes for men, too.\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a parent at home,\nIt’s really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a parent at home who is male.\nAnd um\nA lot of times, people look down upon that because society thinks, \"Well, you’re the male, you should be out working; you should be the money-maker of your family. Why are you staying at home?\"\nAnd it can be really hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job.\nAnd like, it’s working out fine for them,\nBut society looks down upon that.\nAnd then in the fashion industry,\nUm\nA lot of times, people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight.\nI don’t know if that really makes sense,\nBut I guess it’s because typically males who are into fashion\nUm\nHave different lifestyles.\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry,\nPeople will be like, \"Well, wait, how do I really know if you know anything about fashion if you’re a man?\"\nLike, you don’t really know what it’s like.\nLike these other guys.\nAnd so,\nDepending on the field of work you’re in,\nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of more difficult because society has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long way from the 1800s and leaps and bounds,\nBut change is really slow, so I feel that if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are ascending into higher positions and becoming CEOs and they’re getting more accepted in the business world, and it’s a slow process,\nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more.\nAnd just as men who are stay-at-home dads,\nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, \"Oh, wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working.\"\nAnd um\nThen for fashion people, they’ll be like, \"Oh, wait, maybe they’re listening to their female friends or wives and stuff.\"\nAnd so they do know where I’m coming from.\nSo, I guess you kinda have to promote it by showcasing the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotyped against without being too pushy,\nBut um, saying their qualities\nBecause if you force it, people are going to resist.\nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that.\nSo, I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast, it’s like people will resist.\nAnd we’ve come a long way, and change takes time.\nYes\nUm\nWell, I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or where you’re from,\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself\nLike you work your way up into a CEO job,\nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and\nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world,\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, \"Well, how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right?\"\nSo,\nYeah\nSo like sometimes, just where you’re from can discriminate against you,\nAnd like from gender to gender,\nAnd I don’t know,\nI guess that’d be another example.\nUm\nNot really.",
            "My understanding is that they didn't legalize it, they decriminalized it. This moved it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket. It's something you get cited for, instead of being arrested and brought in. If someone gets caught and cited, for job interviews and other things like that, the consequences which are usually the worst part of having a drug charge, don't necessarily go away when it's decriminalized. However, the argument is that it costs a lot to arrest people, bring them in, book them, house them, and go through the court process. This includes paying for public defenders, judges, and the state attorney's office. So, when looking at financially troubled municipalities, many aren't willing to make this kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. However, in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more open-minded, it makes sense. The municipality now has more money to spend on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. It's important because you don't want marijuana to be everywhere, all over the streets. There are other reasons why it shouldn't necessarily be legalized. For example, if it were completely legalized, it could be sold in gas stations, and people would be smoking it everywhere. That could lead to a lot of people smoking and driving, which is still taboo in many places. I also feel that it would be awkward for people. In terms of their effects, alcohol has more debilitating effects on motor skills, but marijuana has a more adverse effect on one's lifestyle. Both have their adverse effects, and no two people react the same way. Some people exercise moderation, while others don't. It makes it hard to generalize about the substance because people react differently. However, I definitely think they both have their own adverse effects.",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nWell\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nWell\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\n\nAnd\nWell\nIt’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nWell\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless",
            "I don’t have a clear opinion on this issue yet, so I can’t say if one side is right or wrong. However, I believe this is the most complicated topic we’re facing today. Something so close to the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage, is very tricky.\n\nI don’t know, I think that all civil unions, I don’t know whether marriage should be viewed in the same way, and defined by the government, seeing as it’s considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn’t get tax breaks or be treated differently by the government if they were baptized. So, if you’re married, I think they should just view it as a civil union, because that’s what it is. It’s two people united together. So, and the fact that gay marriage, I mean, it’s just that two people have a civil union.\n\nWell, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It’s not a big enough cause to amend the constitution. It’s just not important enough to amend the constitution to define or ban gay marriage. Simply put.\n\nUh, no.",
            "I was raised in a Christian household, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don’t necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe it should be legalized. I don’t think it should be a national issue, but rather something that each state decides on its own. The president shouldn’t decide for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. You chose to live there, so you shouldn’t disagree with that decision if the state decides to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state. I don’t think the president should decide for the entire country. I don’t agree with his ban on it. He doesn’t live in every state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he’ll be out of office in a couple of years. If a democratic president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. It should be up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t think so\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr for others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first, I was all for it because I was affected by 9/11 personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much chaos as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think our being over there is gonna do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso, I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said, I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are outdated and not accepting of many things, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adapt to more modern thinking, it would likely not worry about losing its following. I've heard that some people are starting to turn away from the Church due to its views on these issues. Many people disagree with the Church's positions on certain topics. For example, if someone supports abortion, they may feel uncomfortable in a community where it is considered completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in and wants to pursue gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't support it. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the problems that arose. The Church may have done things differently if they were allowed more freedom, but it's hard to say for sure. I don't understand why priests can't be married, as everyone else has jobs and family lives, and it wouldn't prevent them from being devoted to their work and God.",

            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn’t a compelling reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples threaten the heterosexual family, but that's a simplistic view. Same-sex relationships are fundamentally different and have various aspects that make them distinct. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads won't ever be tails, but they're essentially the same. Many civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, are intertwined with marriage. For instance, if you're part of a same-sex couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be your next of kin because they're not legally considered family. This seems unfair if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Numerous studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The key issue is that same-sex couples are not asking for the right to marry in a church; they want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there's no church involvement, this shouldn't be a problem. I can't understand why people, like Catholics, refuse to acknowledge this. If you allow same-sex couples civil unions, why not allow them marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways, like relationship dynamics. Adoption and community issues are also concerns, but children of same-sex couples will grow up with the same parenting skills and potential for societal acceptance as children of heterosexual couples. I believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage across all states. I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the issue, as his views appear to be influenced by his religious beliefs, much like his views on abortion and stem cell research. The main reason I've heard against same-sex marriage is moral opposition, but morality can differ greatly among individuals and groups. It's unethical to ignore the cultural and moral perspectives of the majority of Americans while basing laws on the beliefs of a religious minority. Additionally, many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. We should rely on scientific institutions for information rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",

The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was all false. This rubbed the person the wrong way and they find the Iraq war very frustrating. They believe that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for this. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, which the person considers malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They believe that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th. The person thinks the Bush administration came into office with the intent to go to war. They remember a Treasury Secretary who made these allegations in his book after being forced out. The person thinks the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration and was trying to expand U.S. energy supply in the long term, which is seen as underhanded. They think the situation has gone on long enough, but they worry about the problems if the U.S. withdraws now as it could lead to civil war and more deaths. They think the alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, could also cause long-term problems because of sovereignty issues.

            "I feel really strongly that it’s not right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over this would go against what’s already been written in stone. I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church’s beliefs over another, since most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think it’s up to the government to decide what churches can and can’t do. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution and is fundamental to religious tolerance in the US. Making an amendment about this would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already been stated in the constitution. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t feel it’s right for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue. I don’t see why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anyone in government. There isn’t any reason backing it other than personal views. I don’t see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it could have a positive impact on society. I think I’ve pretty much said it all.",

the chaos that was going to occur\nUm\nAnd here\nAnd the government\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd uphold or implement\nImplement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd its\nAnd its\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t\nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nUm\nBecause there because there are there are\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting\nAn actual army\nYou’re fighting the citizens the\nSpecific citizens in the country and\nSo\nSo I think\nI think that the government\nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and\nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be\nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean worst\nAnd\nEither for what would\nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and\nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that\nThat that the US government in a way tried to\nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a\nA\nA short successful stay in Iraq and\nI mean we shouldn’t\nWe’re kinda\nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nLet’s see\nThe war in Iraq\n\nWell that’s\nNo that’s\nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election\nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and\nAnd so I mean once\nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and\nAnd\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(Coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see to its finish but again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to keep risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re\nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",

            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; they decriminalized it. This knocked it down from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than being arrested and brought in. And if someone gets caught and cited, for job interviews and other things like that, it can have those types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge. I mean, the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, at least for a marijuana charge, is that a lot of kids and people worry about the future ramifications. Those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But there’s an argument that, I mean, it costs a lot to arrest people, bring them in, book them, house them, and then let them go. It costs a lot to have them come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times. And then you have to appoint a public defender. And then you have to pay the judge. And then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, well, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine. And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Um, I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean, for a variety of reasons. But there’s this whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Well, no, I don’t know how I would feel about it. Well, because if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts. Uh, to smoke marijuana. So to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, the volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know. Um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they both have their adverse effects. And I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So it guesses that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",

            "I haven't really made up my mind on this issue yet. I can't say if either side is right or wrong, but I do believe this is the most challenging topic we're facing today. Something so close to the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage, is very tricky without offending anyone. I'm not sure what I think, but I believe that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government, seeing as it is considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized. So, if you're married, I think they should just view it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people getting a civil union. Well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution for something like this. It's just not large enough a cause to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends.

I don’t think it should be a national issue, but it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot are republican. Obviously democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage. If you’re living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. I don’t think you’re in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So, I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI kind of already answered that, but yeah, I don’t feel like Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t at all think so\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I figure it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut  Um\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails  Um\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it  Um\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd  Um\nThat’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd  Um\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut  Um\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr  Um\nOther officials such as the police to go on  Um\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though  Um\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a  Um\nA  Um\nTeacher of mine  Um\nI went to a public high school\nAnd  Um\nThey say  Um\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this  Um\nBecause  Um\nLike  Um\nWe would do like lock downs  Um\nAnd  Um\nStuff  Um\nAnd  Um\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks  Um\nUh  Um\nWe had to be safe about that  Um\nWe had like drill stuff  And\nUm  Um\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the  Um\nSchool shooting  Um\nBecause  Um\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess  Um\nSo we  Um\nYou know  Um\nWe did practice that stuff  Um\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd  Um\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case  Um\nThey were just making it a safer place  Um\nPreventing anything bad from happening  Like  Um\nColumbine or something like that  Um\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such a like emotional thing that happened\nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war if for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are outdated and not accepting of many things, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adapt to more modern thinking, it would likely not worry about losing its following. I've heard that some people are starting to turn away from the Church due to its views on these issues. Many people disagree with the Church's positions on certain topics. For example, if someone supports abortion, they may feel uncomfortable in a community where it is considered completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in and wants to pursue gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't support it. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the problems that arose. The Church may have done things differently if they were allowed more freedom, but it's hard to say for sure. I don't understand why priests can't be married, as everyone else has jobs and family lives, and it wouldn't prevent them from being devoted to their work and God.",

            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn’t a compelling reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples threaten the heterosexual family, but that's a simplistic view. Same-sex relationships are fundamentally different and have various aspects that make them distinct. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads won't ever be tails, but they're essentially the same. Many civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, are intertwined with marriage. For instance, if you're part of a same-sex couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be your next of kin because they're not legally considered family. This seems unfair if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Numerous studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The key issue is that same-sex couples are not asking for the right to marry in a church; they want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there's no church involvement, this shouldn't be a problem. I can't understand why people, like Catholics, refuse to acknowledge this. If you allow same-sex couples civil unions, why not allow them marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways, like relationship dynamics. Adoption and community issues are also concerns, but children of same-sex couples will grow up with the same parenting skills and potential for societal acceptance as children of heterosexual couples. I believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage across all states. I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the issue, as his views appear to be influenced by his religious beliefs, much like his views on abortion and stem cell research. The main reason I've heard against same-sex marriage is moral opposition, but morality can differ greatly among individuals and groups. It's unethical to ignore the cultural and moral perspectives of the majority of Americans while basing laws on the beliefs of a religious minority. Additionally, many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. We should rely on scientific institutions for information rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",

The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was all false. This rubbed the person the wrong way and they find the Iraq war very frustrating. They believe that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for this. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, which the person considers malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They believe that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th. The person thinks the Bush administration came into office with the intent to go to war. They remember a Treasury Secretary who made these allegations in his book after being forced out. The person thinks the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration and was trying to expand U.S. energy supply in the long term, which is seen as underhanded. They think the situation has gone on long enough, but they worry about the problems if the U.S. withdraws now as it could lead to civil war and more deaths. They think the alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, could also cause long-term problems because of sovereignty issues.

            "I feel really strongly that it’s not right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over this would go against what’s already been written in stone. I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church’s beliefs over another, since most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think it’s up to the government to decide what churches can and can’t do. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution and is fundamental to religious tolerance in the US. Making an amendment about this would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already been stated in the constitution. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t feel it’s right for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue. I don’t see why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anyone in government. There isn’t any reason backing it other than personal views. I don’t see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it could have a positive impact on society. I think I’ve pretty much said it all.",

the chaos that was going to occur\nUm\nAnd here\nAnd the government\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd uphold or implement\nImplement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd its\nAnd its\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t\nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nUm\nBecause there because there are there are\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting\nAn actual army\nYou’re fighting the citizens the\nSpecific citizens in the country and\nSo\nSo I think\nI think that the government\nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and\nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be\nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean worst\nAnd\nEither for what would\nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and\nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that\nThat that the US government in a way tried to\nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a\nA\nA short successful stay in Iraq and\nI mean we shouldn’t\nWe’re kinda\nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nLet’s see\nThe war in Iraq\n\nWell that’s\nNo that’s\nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election\nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and\nAnd so I mean once\nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and\nAnd\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(Coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see to its finish but again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to keep risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re\nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",

            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; they decriminalized it. This knocked it down from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than being arrested and brought in. And if someone gets caught and cited, for job interviews and other things like that, it can have those types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge. I mean, the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, at least for a marijuana charge, is that a lot of kids and people worry about the future ramifications. Those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But there’s an argument that, I mean, it costs a lot to arrest people, bring them in, book them, house them, and then let them go. It costs a lot to have them come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times. And then you have to appoint a public defender. And then you have to pay the judge. And then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, well, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine. And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Um, I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean, for a variety of reasons. But there’s this whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Well, no, I don’t know how I would feel about it. Well, because if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts. Uh, to smoke marijuana. So to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, the volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know. Um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they both have their adverse effects. And I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So it guesses that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",

            "I haven't really made up my mind on this issue yet. I can't say if either side is right or wrong, but I do believe this is the most challenging topic we're facing today. Something so close to the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage, is very tricky without offending anyone. I'm not sure what I think, but I believe that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government, seeing as it is considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized. So, if you're married, I think they should just view it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people getting a civil union. Well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution for something like this. It's just not large enough a cause to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends.

I don’t think it should be a national issue, but it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot are republican. Obviously democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage. If you’re living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. I don’t think you’re in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So, I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI kind of already answered that, but yeah, I don’t feel like Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t at all think so\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I figure it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut  Um\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails  Um\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it  Um\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd  Um\nThat’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd  Um\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut  Um\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr  Um\nOther officials such as the police to go on  Um\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though  Um\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a  Um\nA  Um\nTeacher of mine  Um\nI went to a public high school\nAnd  Um\nThey say  Um\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this  Um\nBecause  Um\nLike  Um\nWe would do like lock downs  Um\nAnd  Um\nStuff  Um\nAnd  Um\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks  Um\nUh  Um\nWe had to be safe about that  Um\nWe had like drill stuff  And\nUm  Um\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the  Um\nSchool shooting  Um\nBecause  Um\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess  Um\nSo we  Um\nYou know  Um\nWe did practice that stuff  Um\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd  Um\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case  Um\nThey were just making it a safer place  Um\nPreventing anything bad from happening  Like  Um\nColumbine or something like that  Um\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such a like emotional thing that happened\nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war if for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that in several ways, the Catholic Church needs to change. Their views are outdated and not accepting of many things, such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. If the Church were to adapt to more modern thinking, it would likely not worry about losing its following. I've heard that some people are starting to turn away from the Church due to its views on these issues. Many people disagree with the Church's positions on certain topics. For example, if someone supports abortion, they may feel uncomfortable in a community where it is considered completely wrong. Similarly, if someone believes in and wants to pursue gay marriage, they might not want to be part of a community that doesn't support it. I don't see any reason why the Church can't have female priests or allow priests to be married, but I'm not sure if that would have prevented the problems that arose. The Church may have done things differently if they were allowed more freedom, but it's hard to say for sure. I don't understand why priests can't be married, as everyone else has jobs and family lives, and it wouldn't prevent them from being devoted to their work and God.",

            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized. There isn’t a compelling reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples threaten the heterosexual family, but that's a simplistic view. Same-sex relationships are fundamentally different and have various aspects that make them distinct. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads won't ever be tails, but they're essentially the same. Many civil rights, such as property taxes and healthcare, are intertwined with marriage. For instance, if you're part of a same-sex couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or be your next of kin because they're not legally considered family. This seems unfair if you're spending the rest of your life with someone. Numerous studies have shown that same-sex couples have similar relationship satisfaction rates as heterosexual couples. The key issue is that same-sex couples are not asking for the right to marry in a church; they want a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government. If there's no church involvement, this shouldn't be a problem. I can't understand why people, like Catholics, refuse to acknowledge this. If you allow same-sex couples civil unions, why not allow them marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal. They're the same in many ways, like relationship dynamics. Adoption and community issues are also concerns, but children of same-sex couples will grow up with the same parenting skills and potential for societal acceptance as children of heterosexual couples. I believe the federal government should legalize same-sex marriage across all states. I'm uncertain about President Bush's stance on the issue, as his views appear to be influenced by his religious beliefs, much like his views on abortion and stem cell research. The main reason I've heard against same-sex marriage is moral opposition, but morality can differ greatly among individuals and groups. It's unethical to ignore the cultural and moral perspectives of the majority of Americans while basing laws on the beliefs of a religious minority. Additionally, many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that gay people are psychologically damaged, which is not backed by scientific evidence. The American Psychological Association has debunked this notion. We should rely on scientific institutions for information rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",

The Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama bin Laden and the September 11th attacks and claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which was all false. This rubbed the person the wrong way and they find the Iraq war very frustrating. They believe that the Bush administration lied to the American people and has not taken responsibility for this. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, admitted that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time, which the person considers malfeasance in office and an impeachable offense. They believe that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it since September 11th. The person thinks the Bush administration came into office with the intent to go to war. They remember a Treasury Secretary who made these allegations in his book after being forced out. The person thinks the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein because of his father's administration and was trying to expand U.S. energy supply in the long term, which is seen as underhanded. They think the situation has gone on long enough, but they worry about the problems if the U.S. withdraws now as it could lead to civil war and more deaths. They think the alternative, a coalition of nations from surrounding areas like Syria and Saudi Arabia, could also cause long-term problems because of sovereignty issues.

            "I feel really strongly that it’s not right for it to be made legal or for a state to even declare it as legal. I think it should be left to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. Trying to enforce any kind of power over this would go against what’s already been written in stone. I think those who are trying to make it illegal are choosing one church’s beliefs over another, since most Catholics and Christians are against it. I don’t think it’s up to the government to decide what churches can and can’t do. The separation of church and state has been a key aspect of the constitution and is fundamental to religious tolerance in the US. Making an amendment about this would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already been stated in the constitution. Plus, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict people rather than the government. I don’t feel it’s right for the federal government or any government to be involved in this issue. I don’t see why the president is pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. It should be up to the churches to decide this, not the president or anyone in government. There isn’t any reason backing it other than personal views. I don’t see how it will impact the economy or society. If anything, it could have a positive impact on society. I think I’ve pretty much said it all.",

the chaos that was going to occur\nUm\nAnd here\nAnd the government\nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam\nThey were trying to push out Communists\nAnd\nAnd uphold or implement\nImplement and uphold democracy\nAnd\nAnd its\nAnd its\nAnd the government\nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t\nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear\nI mean it was more of a\nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because\nBecause\nUm\nBecause there because there are there are\nNo matter how many people may have supported\nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting\nAn actual army\nYou’re fighting the citizens the\nSpecific citizens in the country and\nSo\nSo I think\nI think that the government\nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and\nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be\nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes\nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been\nI mean worst\nAnd\nEither for what would\nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and\nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still\nUm\nMany American troops are still dying and\nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi\nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that\nThat that the US government in a way tried to\nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a\nA\nA short successful stay in Iraq and\nI mean we shouldn’t\nWe’re kinda\nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful\nI mean in our own country\nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was\nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and\nUm\nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government\nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do\nAnd\nUm\nSo\nAnd so\nLet’s see\nThe war in Iraq\n\nWell that’s\nNo that’s\nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because\nThat was\nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election\nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of\nUm\nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and\nAnd so I mean once\nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long how can we abandon these people\nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and\nAnd\nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them now so\nSo it's probably something that we should\n(Coughs)\nExcuse me\nTry to see to its finish but again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and\nAnd\nAnd how\nAnd how much is too much to keep risking for\nFor a free democratic Iraq\nI mean\nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq\nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re\nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq\nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is\nIs the\nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not",

            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; they decriminalized it. This knocked it down from a criminal offense to a more minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. You know, something you just get cited for rather than being arrested and brought in. And if someone gets caught and cited, for job interviews and other things like that, it can have those types of ramifications, which are usually the worst of having a drug charge. I mean, the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, at least for a marijuana charge, is that a lot of kids and people worry about the future ramifications. Those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized. But there’s an argument that, I mean, it costs a lot to arrest people, bring them in, book them, house them, and then let them go. It costs a lot to have them come to court once, maybe twice, maybe three times. And then you have to appoint a public defender. And then you have to pay the judge. And then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges. I mean, all of that stuff costs a lot to do. And um, well, when you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them. Like a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that. But in a place like Denver, where people tend to be more on the kind of open, I have to use the word liberal, but you know what I mean, kind of thought track, then I think it’s totally fine. And I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. Um, I mean, so I think it’s important because marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere, all over the streets and stuff. Um, I mean, for a variety of reasons. But there’s this whole financial element to it as well. Other reasons like? Well, no, I don’t know how I would feel about it. Well, because if it were totally legalized, I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere. Then I mean, a lot of people would be like smoking and driving. And um, it still is like taboo in our society in a lot of places and a lot of contexts. Uh, to smoke marijuana. So to have it out in the open like that, I feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people. Um, the volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um, I don’t really know. Um, I think in general, alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um, but I think in general, marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision-making motor skills. I mean, but they both have their adverse effects. And I mean, I feel like when it comes to substances in general, no two people really react the same way. I mean, and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to the wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation, and then some people don’t. So it guesses that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react differently. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um, yeah, uh, no, I don’t.",

            "I haven't really made up my mind on this issue yet. I can't say if either side is right or wrong, but I do believe this is the most challenging topic we're facing today. Something so close to the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage, is very tricky without offending anyone. I'm not sure what I think, but I believe that all civil unions, I don't know whether marriage should be looked at and defined by the government, seeing as it is considered a sacrament. Well, people wouldn't get tax breaks or be looked at in any specific way by the government if they were baptized. So, if you're married, I think they should just view it as a civil union, because that's what it is - two people united together. And the fact that gay marriage, I mean, that would just be two people getting a civil union. Well, if all the states can come to a logical conclusion, then they should push to make it federal law, but a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous. It's not important enough to amend the constitution for something like this. It's just not large enough a cause to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. Simply put, no.",
            "I was actually raised in a Christian home, so like homosexuality is kind of a grey area for me. Because I have a lot of gay friends.

I don’t think it should be a national issue, but it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot are republican. Obviously democratic states are gonna push for gay marriage. If you’re living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. I don’t think you’re in a place to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage, because you kind of chose to live there. So, I think that homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, and it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI kind of already answered that, but yeah, I don’t feel like Bush should be allowed to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don’t agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don’t think that Bush doesn’t live in every single state, so he shouldn’t be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. Plus, he’s gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides to lift the ban on gay marriage, it’s just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they’re the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don’t.",
            "Um\nNo, I don’t at all think so\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I figure it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut  Um\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails  Um\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd  Um\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it  Um\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd  Um\nThat’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd  Um\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut  Um\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr  Um\nOther officials such as the police to go on  Um\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though  Um\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a  Um\nA  Um\nTeacher of mine  Um\nI went to a public high school\nAnd  Um\nThey say  Um\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this  Um\nBecause  Um\nLike  Um\nWe would do like lock downs  Um\nAnd  Um\nStuff  Um\nAnd  Um\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks  Um\nUh  Um\nWe had to be safe about that  Um\nWe had like drill stuff  And\nUm  Um\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the  Um\nSchool shooting  Um\nBecause  Um\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess  Um\nSo we  Um\nYou know  Um\nWe did practice that stuff  Um\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd  Um\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case  Um\nThey were just making it a safer place  Um\nPreventing anything bad from happening  Like  Um\nColumbine or something like that  Um\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such a like emotional thing that happened\nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war if for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone one definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change. Their views I think a lot of people have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things. Within the case of I know like gay marriages, within the case of abortion, within the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them which is fine but they have a little bit old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they wouldn’t be worried about losing their following. Well I’ve heard there’s a lot of people starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their way that they see these situations. And people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So I feel they feel that the Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things. Yeah I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion so if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and that you were going against it. Well I mean the same I guess with gay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about you might not want to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that. I don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married but I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean I don’t know if they might not have just done that if they had been allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it. Well I mean that was something they did and that was something that I don’t know that a whole that was something they did and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean if they were married would they have done it differently. It’s hard to really tell. Yeah well I don’t see why priests can’t be married I mean the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they’re devoted their complete life but I don’t see everyone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life and the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both.

            "I think that same-sex marriage should be legalized because there is no good reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but these couples are different; they have so many diverse aspects that they cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same, but they are similar. In addition, there are several civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare, where your partner cannot be with you when you're sick or cannot visit because they're not considered family. This seems silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just relationships, the same thing. People often get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to marry in a church, but they're asking for a legal marriage certificate, a document provided by the government. If there's no church involvement, then it shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why some people, like Catholics, would say it's against their religion or morally wrong, especially when they're not being forced to participate in a church ceremony. If you allow someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the relationship roles played by different partners. People also worry about adoption issues and how gay couples living in their community will affect it, and about the children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society. However, I think the main issue is how children are treated by their peers and adults in society. In New York City, for example, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they often get bullied in public schools. I believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state and that the amendment should be changed to allow it. President Bush has strong views on this issue, primarily based on his religious beliefs. His stance on this issue is similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard for opposition are moral reasons, and morality differs from person to person. It's unethical to embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. To create a law banning gay marriage based on the beliefs of religious groups is hypocritical, considering recent controversies like the \"under God\" pledge and the opposition to it. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's due to psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects. This is not accurate, according to the American Psychological Association. If people listened to institutions that research these topics instead of popular opinion, the world might be seen differently.",
            "First off, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, if we were to make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial at all. You get what I mean?\n\nYeah, I mean, there are plenty of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, stuff like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, then sure, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana is a tough one. I'd say, not to legalize it all at once, but gradually, because then it might get abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "Um\nI think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nUm\nIt’s not as strict as it used to be.\nI know, as I’ve grown up, when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday.\nAnd\nI would get cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nAnd\nThat was every time I went to a private school\nAnd\nI would see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe would just go\nBut\nNow as I’ve gotten older, they’ve made a teenager mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nAnd\nPeople dress a lot more casually\nDuring summer especially, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach.\nYou’d have families there that are just running in late.\nSo I think it has become more casual.\nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up,\nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis.\nWell, khakis are nice too,\nBut\nJust a lot more casual in comparison to that.\nAs for other things,\nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed,\nLike\nThat’s the church I know.\nI don’t know the politics of the church and whatnot.\nBut\nYeah\nThat’s it.\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm\nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided.\nBecause\nThere are men who are married\nAnd\nThey still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have\nUh\nAn attraction towards young kids.\nSo\nI think even if you got them married, it’s just the person; it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married.\nUm\nI think also when they’re becoming a priest, it’s their choice to become a priest.\nUm\nThere are religions where they’re allowed to get married, like in Seventh Heaven.

            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I believe that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war has always gotten under my skin.\n\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who came back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time. And to me, that’s just negligence in office; it’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11th. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nThe last part, I forget the name of the secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. But it seems like the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative the UN and the United States are moving to at this point is a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will become a major issue. It’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I’ve seen, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.

            "I feel like the war has gone on much longer than necessary. Initially, the purpose was clear: to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have since lost sight of that goal and are now engaged in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. It seems that the original motivations, including George Bush's father's past disagreements with Saddam Hussein, were questionable. If the aim was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would have been a justifiable cause. However, I do not believe personal matters were involved. I think our purpose was clear at the outset, but the war has dragged on far too long. The conflict has become a means in itself, and we are reluctant to end it without a decisive victory. It has gone on long enough, and it should stop. The Iraqi government will eventually have to stand on its own, and I believe that time has come. We are draining our own economy by spending billions on a war that has long lost its justification. While we struggle with issues like poverty and lack of infrastructure at home, we continue to pour resources into a war that should not be a long-term priority. Instead, we should be investing in our own citizens, improving our public roads, and ensuring access to healthcare.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUm, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was something like that.\n\nO, okay.\nUm.\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone’s profile.\nYou might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that.\nBut if that’s the case, you’ve accepted that person as your “friend,” so they can see it.\nYou’re giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum.\nUm.\nThat’s tough.\nBecause, I mean, obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.”\nUm.\nI mean, I don’t think it would really be right to go and have somebody’s job be to look at people’s profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation.\nLike, was someone just randomly looking at people’s profiles and just happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don’t really know.\n\nSure.\nUm.\nWell, um, like, I mean, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook.\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm.\nThis man was just trying to prove how easily he could get information.\nAnd he went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away.\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger in like, you know, less than a minute, and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it’s me.\nAnd it’s hard because you think they know your interests.\nThey know what you look like.\nSometimes, if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day.\nWho your friends are.\nThey pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don’t want to limit it too much.\nSo it’s a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo.\n\nHum.\nUh.\nWell.\nI heard my roommate saying that her high school had this whole issue where students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd that struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I think I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "I feel that there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It doesn't just affect women; it also depends on the specific field of work you're in. Overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling, where even if there is supposed to be equality, it's hard for many to work underneath a woman if they're a man, due to societal norms that have existed for so long. In the workplace, women often see jobs they can reach and have the qualifications for, but sometimes the board might not choose to promote them just because historically it hasn't been seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. The same goes for men, especially in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and often people look down on that because society thinks that men should be working and earning money for the family. It can be hard on men who have always dreamed of being with the children and helping to raise them, especially if the wife has a better job. In the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight because they have different lifestyles and people might question if they truly understand fashion for women. Depending on the field of work, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Changing it is difficult because society has a set mindset, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is very slow. However, it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. It's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads, as they realize that the woman might have the better job or wants to be the one working. In the fashion industry, people might think that men are listening to their female friends or wives and understand what they're talking about. So, you kind of have to promote the good qualities of those who are stereotypically against them, not by being too pushy, but by emphasizing their qualities. If you force it, people will resist, and we're already at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced. I don't think there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. We've come a long way, and change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; instead, they decriminalized it. This change knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic violation. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested and brought in. And if someone gets caught and cited, those consequences are usually less severe than a drug charge. For example, a marijuana charge can still have future implications, like when it comes to job interviews. While decriminalization doesn’t completely erase these worries, it can also be argued that it saves money on arrests, court appearances, and legal fees. Financial strain can sometimes lead municipalities to be unwilling to make such changes, especially in places where marijuana is widely opposed. However, in more open-minded communities like Denver, it’s generally accepted, and the municipality can then reallocate funds to education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. I don’t think marijuana should be legal and easily accessible everywhere, as it could lead to excessive use and driving under the influence, which is still widely frowned upon. Additionally, I believe alcohol has a more pronounced effect on motor skills, but marijuana can significantly impact one’s lifestyle. Each person reacts differently to substances, and some people tend to moderate their use while others do not. Therefore, it’s challenging to make generalizations about the effects of substances. However, I do believe that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects.",

However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides for itself rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot of states are republican. Obviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage because you kind of chose to live there. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals and I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI kind of already answered that, but...

            "Um\nNo, I don’t at all\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I figure it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd  I don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened\nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change. Their views I think a lot of people have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things. Within the case of I know like gay marriages, within the case of abortion, within the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them which is fine but they have a little bit old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they wouldn’t be worried about losing their following. Well I’ve heard there’s a lot of people starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their way that they see these situations. And people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So I feel they feel that the Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things. Yeah I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion so if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and that you were going against it. Well I mean the same I guess with gay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about you might not want to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that. I don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married but I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean I don’t know if they might not have just done that if they had been allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it. Well I mean that was something they did and that was something that I don’t know that a whole that was something they did and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean if they were married would they have done it differently. It’s hard to really tell. Yeah well I don’t see why priests can’t be married I mean the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they’re devoted their complete life but I don’t see everyone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life and the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both.

            "I think that same-sex marriage should be legalized because there is no good reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but these couples are different; they have so many diverse aspects that they cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same, but they are similar. In addition, there are several civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare, where your partner cannot be with you when you're sick or cannot visit because they're not considered family. This seems silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just relationships, the same thing. People often get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to marry in a church, but they're asking for a legal marriage certificate, a document provided by the government. If there's no church involvement, then it shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why some people, like Catholics, would say it's against their religion or morally wrong, especially when they're not being forced to participate in a church ceremony. If you allow someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the relationship roles played by different partners. People also worry about adoption issues and how gay couples living in their community will affect it, and about the children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society. However, I think the main issue is how children are treated by their peers and adults in society. In New York City, for example, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they often get bullied in public schools. I believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state and that the amendment should be changed to allow it. President Bush has strong views on this issue, primarily based on his religious beliefs. His stance on this issue is similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard for opposition are moral reasons, and morality differs from person to person. It's unethical to embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. To create a law banning gay marriage based on the beliefs of religious groups is hypocritical, considering recent controversies like the \"under God\" pledge and the opposition to it. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's due to psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects. This is not accurate, according to the American Psychological Association. If people listened to institutions that research these topics instead of popular opinion, the world might be seen differently.",
            "First off, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, if we were to make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial at all. You get what I mean?\n\nYeah, I mean, there are plenty of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, stuff like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, then sure, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana is a tough one. I'd say, not to legalize it all at once, but gradually, because then it might get abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "Um\nI think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nUm\nIt’s not as strict as it used to be.\nI know, as I’ve grown up, when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday.\nAnd\nI would get cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nAnd\nThat was every time I went to a private school\nAnd\nI would see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe would just go\nBut\nNow as I’ve gotten older, they’ve made a teenager mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nAnd\nPeople dress a lot more casually\nDuring summer especially, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach.\nYou’d have families there that are just running in late.\nSo I think it has become more casual.\nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up,\nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis.\nWell, khakis are nice too,\nBut\nJust a lot more casual in comparison to that.\nAs for other things,\nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed,\nLike\nThat’s the church I know.\nI don’t know the politics of the church and whatnot.\nBut\nYeah\nThat’s it.\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm\nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided.\nBecause\nThere are men who are married\nAnd\nThey still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have\nUh\nAn attraction towards young kids.\nSo\nI think even if you got them married, it’s just the person; it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married.\nUm\nI think also when they’re becoming a priest, it’s their choice to become a priest.\nUm\nThere are religions where they’re allowed to get married, like in Seventh Heaven.

            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I believe that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war has always gotten under my skin.\n\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who came back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time. And to me, that’s just negligence in office; it’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11th. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nThe last part, I forget the name of the secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. But it seems like the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative the UN and the United States are moving to at this point is a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will become a major issue. It’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I’ve seen, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.

            "I feel like the war has gone on much longer than necessary. Initially, the purpose was clear: to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have since lost sight of that goal and are now engaged in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. It seems that the original motivations, including George Bush's father's past disagreements with Saddam Hussein, were questionable. If the aim was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would have been a justifiable cause. However, I do not believe personal matters were involved. I think our purpose was clear at the outset, but the war has dragged on far too long. The conflict has become a means in itself, and we are reluctant to end it without a decisive victory. It has gone on long enough, and it should stop. The Iraqi government will eventually have to stand on its own, and I believe that time has come. We are draining our own economy by spending billions on a war that has long lost its justification. While we struggle with issues like poverty and lack of infrastructure at home, we continue to pour resources into a war that should not be a long-term priority. Instead, we should be investing in our own citizens, improving our public roads, and ensuring access to healthcare.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUm, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was something like that.\n\nO, okay.\nUm.\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone’s profile.\nYou might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that.\nBut if that’s the case, you’ve accepted that person as your “friend,” so they can see it.\nYou’re giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum.\nUm.\nThat’s tough.\nBecause, I mean, obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.”\nUm.\nI mean, I don’t think it would really be right to go and have somebody’s job be to look at people’s profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation.\nLike, was someone just randomly looking at people’s profiles and just happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don’t really know.\n\nSure.\nUm.\nWell, um, like, I mean, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook.\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm.\nThis man was just trying to prove how easily he could get information.\nAnd he went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away.\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger in like, you know, less than a minute, and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it’s me.\nAnd it’s hard because you think they know your interests.\nThey know what you look like.\nSometimes, if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day.\nWho your friends are.\nThey pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don’t want to limit it too much.\nSo it’s a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo.\n\nHum.\nUh.\nWell.\nI heard my roommate saying that her high school had this whole issue where students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd that struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I think I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "I feel that there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It doesn't just affect women; it also depends on the specific field of work you're in. Overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling, where even if there is supposed to be equality, it's hard for many to work underneath a woman if they're a man, due to societal norms that have existed for so long. In the workplace, women often see jobs they can reach and have the qualifications for, but sometimes the board might not choose to promote them just because historically it hasn't been seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. The same goes for men, especially in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and often people look down on that because society thinks that men should be working and earning money for the family. It can be hard on men who have always dreamed of being with the children and helping to raise them, especially if the wife has a better job. In the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight because they have different lifestyles and people might question if they truly understand fashion for women. Depending on the field of work, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Changing it is difficult because society has a set mindset, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is very slow. However, it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. It's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads, as they realize that the woman might have the better job or wants to be the one working. In the fashion industry, people might think that men are listening to their female friends or wives and understand what they're talking about. So, you kind of have to promote the good qualities of those who are stereotypically against them, not by being too pushy, but by emphasizing their qualities. If you force it, people will resist, and we're already at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced. I don't think there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. We've come a long way, and change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; instead, they decriminalized it. This change knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic violation. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested and brought in. And if someone gets caught and cited, those consequences are usually less severe than a drug charge. For example, a marijuana charge can still have future implications, like when it comes to job interviews. While decriminalization doesn’t completely erase these worries, it can also be argued that it saves money on arrests, court appearances, and legal fees. Financial strain can sometimes lead municipalities to be unwilling to make such changes, especially in places where marijuana is widely opposed. However, in more open-minded communities like Denver, it’s generally accepted, and the municipality can then reallocate funds to education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. I don’t think marijuana should be legal and easily accessible everywhere, as it could lead to excessive use and driving under the influence, which is still widely frowned upon. Additionally, I believe alcohol has a more pronounced effect on motor skills, but marijuana can significantly impact one’s lifestyle. Each person reacts differently to substances, and some people tend to moderate their use while others do not. Therefore, it’s challenging to make generalizations about the effects of substances. However, I do believe that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects.",

However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides for itself rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot of states are republican. Obviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage because you kind of chose to live there. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals and I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI kind of already answered that, but...

            "Um\nNo, I don’t at all\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I figure it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd  I don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened\nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change. Their views I think a lot of people have been talking about how the Catholic Church is losing some of its following and I think it's because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things. Within the case of I know like gay marriages, within the case of abortion, within the case of birth control, things like that. I think the Catholic Church has very strong views on them which is fine but they have a little bit old-fashioned views in some ways. So I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they wouldn’t be worried about losing their following. Well I’ve heard there’s a lot of people starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their way that they see these situations. And people are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects. So I feel they feel that the Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things. Yeah I mean the Catholic Church is against abortion so if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong and that you were going against it. Well I mean the same I guess with gay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in and that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about you might not want to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that. I don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married but I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened. I mean I don’t know if they might not have just done that if they had been allowed to be married or if there were women priests. But I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it. Well I mean that was something they did and that was something that I don’t know that a whole that was something they did and it might not have really seemed to be affected. I mean if they were married would they have done it differently. It’s hard to really tell. Yeah well I don’t see why priests can’t be married I mean the Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God and they’re devoted their complete life but I don’t see everyone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life and the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both.

            "I think that same-sex marriage should be legalized because there is no good reason not to. Many people believe that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but these couples are different; they have so many diverse aspects that they cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin – heads and tails are not the same, but they are similar. In addition, there are several civil rights that come with marriage, such as property taxes and healthcare, where your partner cannot be with you when you're sick or cannot visit because they're not considered family. This seems silly if you're going to spend the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have the same success rates and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. They're just relationships, the same thing. People often get hung up on the idea that homosexuals are asking for the right to marry in a church, but they're asking for a legal marriage certificate, a document provided by the government. If there's no church involvement, then it shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why some people, like Catholics, would say it's against their religion or morally wrong, especially when they're not being forced to participate in a church ceremony. If you allow someone a civil union, why not allow them a marriage? It's like segregation – separate but unequal. They are the same in many ways, like the relationship roles played by different partners. People also worry about adoption issues and how gay couples living in their community will affect it, and about the children of gay couples and how they'll adjust to society. However, I think the main issue is how children are treated by their peers and adults in society. In New York City, for example, there are special schools for children of gay parents because they often get bullied in public schools. I believe the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state and that the amendment should be changed to allow it. President Bush has strong views on this issue, primarily based on his religious beliefs. His stance on this issue is similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard for opposition are moral reasons, and morality differs from person to person. It's unethical to embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest. To create a law banning gay marriage based on the beliefs of religious groups is hypocritical, considering recent controversies like the \"under God\" pledge and the opposition to it. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe it's due to psychological damage from childhood trauma or personality defects. This is not accurate, according to the American Psychological Association. If people listened to institutions that research these topics instead of popular opinion, the world might be seen differently.",
            "First off, I work at a hospital pharmacy during the summer, and let me tell you, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. I mean, if we were to make it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial at all. You get what I mean?\n\nYeah, I mean, there are plenty of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, stuff like that. Those are controlled substances, but we use them all the time because they're beneficial. If you deny those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don't think it's that similar to alcohol. If you abuse it, then sure, alcohol can lead to bad things. But marijuana is a tough one. I'd say, not to legalize it all at once, but gradually, because then it might get abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. People have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug, but it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. If we get rid of that image of marijuana as this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly, and certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "Um\nI think the church has already adapted to the twenty-first century.\nUm\nIt’s not as strict as it used to be.\nI know, as I’ve grown up, when I was younger, I would always go to church every Sunday.\nAnd\nI would get cute little dresses\nAnd\nMatching shoes\nAnd\nA matching purse\nAnd\nThat was every time I went to a private school\nAnd\nI would see all my friends there on the weekends\nAnd\nWe would just go\nBut\nNow as I’ve gotten older, they’ve made a teenager mass\nAnd\nThey cut it down to thirty minutes\nAnd\nPeople dress a lot more casually\nDuring summer especially, people would come in their beach clothes, straight from the beach.\nYou’d have families there that are just running in late.\nSo I think it has become more casual.\nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up,\nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis.\nWell, khakis are nice too,\nBut\nJust a lot more casual in comparison to that.\nAs for other things,\nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed,\nLike\nThat’s the church I know.\nI don’t know the politics of the church and whatnot.\nBut\nYeah\nThat’s it.\n[OK, regarding all the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed, for example, by allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm\nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided.\nBecause\nThere are men who are married\nAnd\nThey still become pedophiles\nAnd\nThey still have\nUh\nAn attraction towards young kids.\nSo\nI think even if you got them married, it’s just the person; it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married.\nUm\nI think also when they’re becoming a priest, it’s their choice to become a priest.\nUm\nThere are religions where they’re allowed to get married, like in Seventh Heaven.

            "(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I believe that everyone was still reeling from the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq under false pretenses. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq. Early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which has since proven false. This has always rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war has always gotten under my skin.\n\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration openly lied to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it. Even Colin Powell, who came back from his big presentation at the UN, now says he wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time. And to me, that’s just negligence in office; it’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that. I think the Bush administration has shown a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since September 11th. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nThe last part, I forget the name of the secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office. But it seems like the younger Bush kind of came in with a blood vengeance feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration, and I think in the long term, he was hoping to expand our energy supply, which is a very underhanded way to do things.\n\nWell, I do think it’s gone on long enough. I think there would be problems if we withdrew right now, though, because there’s a good chance the country would lapse into civil war, and even more people would die as a result. I think the alternative the UN and the United States are moving to at this point is a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to come in and try to restore order. But I don’t necessarily know that’s a good idea either, because I think in the long term, that will also cause more problems because Iraq’s sovereignty will become a major issue. It’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\n\nJust from the news reports I’ve seen, it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all. Oh, I can’t remember his name, but the Prime Minister really has no control over the political process or what’s happening. Even Muqtada al-Sadr, the guy we were fighting less than a year ago, his party now holds at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament, and we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements vying for control of the government.

            "I feel like the war has gone on much longer than necessary. Initially, the purpose was clear: to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have since lost sight of that goal and are now engaged in the conflict merely to demonstrate our power. It seems that the original motivations, including George Bush's father's past disagreements with Saddam Hussein, were questionable. If the aim was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would have been a justifiable cause. However, I do not believe personal matters were involved. I think our purpose was clear at the outset, but the war has dragged on far too long. The conflict has become a means in itself, and we are reluctant to end it without a decisive victory. It has gone on long enough, and it should stop. The Iraqi government will eventually have to stand on its own, and I believe that time has come. We are draining our own economy by spending billions on a war that has long lost its justification. While we struggle with issues like poverty and lack of infrastructure at home, we continue to pour resources into a war that should not be a long-term priority. Instead, we should be investing in our own citizens, improving our public roads, and ensuring access to healthcare.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nUm, it was prevented because someone went online and found out that there was something like that.\n\nO, okay.\nUm.\nNo, I don’t think that’s an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information online, it’s pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone’s profile.\nYou might need to, you know, be their friend or something like that.\nBut if that’s the case, you’ve accepted that person as your “friend,” so they can see it.\nYou’re giving them permission to see your profile.\nSo, I mean, anytime you put information online, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum.\nUm.\nThat’s tough.\nBecause, I mean, obviously you can’t have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody’s different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, “Let’s look at the bad kids and make sure they’re not up to anything.”\nUm.\nI mean, I don’t think it would really be right to go and have somebody’s job be to look at people’s profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation.\nLike, was someone just randomly looking at people’s profiles and just happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don’t really know.\n\nSure.\nUm.\nWell, um, like, I mean, I don’t have a Myspace personally, but I have a Facebook.\nI do.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm.\nThis man was just trying to prove how easily he could get information.\nAnd he went onto this girl’s profile and got her screen name right away.\nAnd was talking to her on instant messenger in like, you know, less than a minute, and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn’t meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don’t recognize their screen names but they IM me and they know it’s me.\nAnd it’s hard because you think they know your interests.\nThey know what you look like.\nSometimes, if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day.\nWho your friends are.\nThey pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point is I think the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don’t want to limit it too much.\nSo it’s a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo.\n\nHum.\nUh.\nWell.\nI heard my roommate saying that her high school had this whole issue where students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd that struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn’t sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren’t allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd I don’t know if that’s really a privacy issue, but I think I don’t really know how they had the right to tell people that.\n\nThat’s the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "I feel that there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It doesn't just affect women; it also depends on the specific field of work you're in. Overall, I think women have it harder because of the glass ceiling, where even if there is supposed to be equality, it's hard for many to work underneath a woman if they're a man, due to societal norms that have existed for so long. In the workplace, women often see jobs they can reach and have the qualifications for, but sometimes the board might not choose to promote them just because historically it hasn't been seen that women are usually in the upper echelons of the business world. The same goes for men, especially in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. It's really uncommon to have a male parent staying at home, and often people look down on that because society thinks that men should be working and earning money for the family. It can be hard on men who have always dreamed of being with the children and helping to raise them, especially if the wife has a better job. In the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight because they have different lifestyles and people might question if they truly understand fashion for women. Depending on the field of work, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. Changing it is difficult because society has a set mindset, and while we've come a long way from the 1800s, change is very slow. However, it's happening, and people are starting to accept it more. It's also becoming more acceptable for men to be stay-at-home dads, as they realize that the woman might have the better job or wants to be the one working. In the fashion industry, people might think that men are listening to their female friends or wives and understand what they're talking about. So, you kind of have to promote the good qualities of those who are stereotypically against them, not by being too pushy, but by emphasizing their qualities. If you force it, people will resist, and we're already at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced. I don't think there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist. We've come a long way, and change takes time.",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it; instead, they decriminalized it. This change knocked it down from a criminal offense to something more akin to a traffic violation. You know, something you get cited for rather than being booked and arrested and brought in. And if someone gets caught and cited, those consequences are usually less severe than a drug charge. For example, a marijuana charge can still have future implications, like when it comes to job interviews. While decriminalization doesn’t completely erase these worries, it can also be argued that it saves money on arrests, court appearances, and legal fees. Financial strain can sometimes lead municipalities to be unwilling to make such changes, especially in places where marijuana is widely opposed. However, in more open-minded communities like Denver, it’s generally accepted, and the municipality can then reallocate funds to education, social programs, and services for the elderly and homeless. I don’t think marijuana should be legal and easily accessible everywhere, as it could lead to excessive use and driving under the influence, which is still widely frowned upon. Additionally, I believe alcohol has a more pronounced effect on motor skills, but marijuana can significantly impact one’s lifestyle. Each person reacts differently to substances, and some people tend to moderate their use while others do not. Therefore, it’s challenging to make generalizations about the effects of substances. However, I do believe that both alcohol and marijuana have their own adverse effects.",

However, I feel as though it should be something that each state decides for itself rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nWell, like a lot of states are democratic and a lot of states are republican. Obviously democratic states are going to push for gay marriage, and if you’re living in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about that position. And I don’t think that you’re necessarily in a place to disagree with that decision if a state does decide to legalize gay marriage because you kind of chose to live there. So I think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals and I feel as though it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI kind of already answered that, but...

            "Um\nNo, I don’t at all\nUm\nLet’s see, I\nThe way I figure it\nMyspace is a public thing\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at that definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever you’re trying to get at\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it underneath the school’s name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on to the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd  I don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the school shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was all for it because I was affected by nine eleven personally\nUm\nI was all for going over there and pretty much creating as much havoc as they did over here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional thing that happened\nI think that we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long run\nAnd we kind of just went over there like unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was all for it\nBut now I’m very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other they can’t be fighting with us as well\nLike I don’t think us being over there is gonna do anything if they’re\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of nine eleven I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know like what we were gonna face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because war for them is very different than war for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that’s really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle and\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on definitely long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious choice. So I think people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like it's so much a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a personal choice. I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue either. Again, I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.\nBecause\nWell, basically, there’s not a good reason not to.\nUm\nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\nBut\nIt’s so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same.\nIt’s just\nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin.\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt’s like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don’t want to say next of kin\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is\nBut\nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick\nAnd\nCan’t visit\n‘Cause they’re not technically family\nAnd\nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days\nAnd\nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is\nUm\nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\nAnd\nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue\nBecause\nI can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal\nYeah\nThey are\nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they’ll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent’s\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt’s kind of hard to say\nI’m not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of gay parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt’s just a kid\nI mean\nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it’s just about personality choices\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking gay marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on gay marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI’m not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently\nNope",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties.

Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial.

But if you abuse alcohol too, that can also lead to bad things. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say not that you could integrate it, let it become legal gradually but not all at once.

            "English translation:\n(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war really gets under my skin.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration lied openly to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean I think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\nUm\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don’t feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don’t like keep up with it\nI don’t know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel it’s right\nTo legalize it or for a state to declare it as legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because the constitution says separation of church and state\nIt’s clearly stated\nClearly stated\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to control it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people trying to make it illegal\nI think that’s really choosing one church’s beliefs over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it\nAnd don’t support it except for in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to make illegal or legal\n\nUh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh, a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they might plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it wouldn’t have\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq, and I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war, especially for a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is like a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. They were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government, the American government, was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\n\nUm\nAnd the government, the United States, is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy.\n\nI think the government, the US government, should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear victory, like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because, um, because there are, there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army.\n\nYou’re fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and so I think, I think that the government, first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into this war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been.\n\nI mean, really not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still, um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn’t be naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today, and there was lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, let’s see.\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because, well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started. And so, I mean, once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? So it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish, but again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? And I think the big reason for that is the oil issue, and this is where we are getting our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources. I mean, before going into war, one of the predispositions was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet’s see.\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nAnd it\nNot only affects women, but also men, depending on the field of work they're in\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling where, even when equality is supposedly there, many people struggle to place someone under a woman if they're a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, many times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but the board might not elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not common for women to be in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd the same applies to men\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent\nIt's really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a stay-at-home parent who's a man\nAnd many people look down upon that because society thinks, well you're a man, you should be working and making money\nWhy are you staying at home?\nIt can be really hard for them because it might be their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople don't really take men seriously if they're straight\nUm\nBecause typically, men involved in fashion lead unconventional lifestyles\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man in the fashion industry, people might think, well how can I really trust you know what fashion is for women?\nLike you don't really know what we're about\nLike those other guys\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s, but change is really slow\nSo, I feel like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are moving into higher positions and becoming CEOs, and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as with stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working\nAnd um\nFor fashion people, they might be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nSo they do know what I'm talking about\nSo I guess you kinda have to promote it by highlighting the good qualities of people who are typically stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but rather saying their good qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it.\nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket.\nYou know something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that.\nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited then for job interviews and all sorts of things like that,\nThose types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be a concern.\nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge.\nAt least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.\nBut at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and then to house them and then to let them go.\nAnd then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times.\nAnd then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges.\nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do.\nAnd I mean so,\nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.\nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that.\nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more liberal, then I think it’s totally fine.\nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education.\nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people.\nUm so it’s important, cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere.\nAll over the streets and stuff.\nUm I mean for a variety of reasons,\nBut there’s this whole financial element to it as well.\nOther reasons like why it shouldn’t necessarily,\nWell no, I mean I I don’t know how I would feel about,\nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.\nThen I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving.\nAnd um, it still is like taboo in our society,\nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts,\nUh to smoke marijuana.\nSo to have it out in the open like that,\nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people.\nUm and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um I don’t really know. Um I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah. Uh no I don’t",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nUm\nI guess\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nUm\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nUm\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nUm\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless\n\nNope",
            "Um\nI don't\nI haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet\nSo\nI can't say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don't know, I think\nI think that all civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament, like considered\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nBe looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got united together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "**\nI was raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. Nevertheless, I believe it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Clearly, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. You know, because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI sort of already answered that, but\nYes, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to\nDecide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n**",
            "Um\nNo, I don't in the slightest\nUm\nLet's see\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever it is you're trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious choice. So I think people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like it's so much a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a personal choice. I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue either. Again, I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.\nBecause\nWell, basically, there’s not a good reason not to.\nUm\nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\nBut\nIt’s so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same.\nIt’s just\nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin.\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt’s like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don’t want to say next of kin\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is\nBut\nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick\nAnd\nCan’t visit\n‘Cause they’re not technically family\nAnd\nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days\nAnd\nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is\nUm\nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\nAnd\nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue\nBecause\nI can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal\nYeah\nThey are\nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they’ll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent’s\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt’s kind of hard to say\nI’m not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of gay parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt’s just a kid\nI mean\nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it’s just about personality choices\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking gay marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on gay marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI’m not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently\nNope",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. So, as far as making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But, if we're talking about using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. Because marijuana, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can also lead to bad things. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say not that you could integrate it, let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nUh, yeah. Um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Um, so, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope",

            "English translation:\n(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war really gets under my skin.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration lied openly to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean I think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\nUm\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don’t feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don’t like keep up with it\nI don’t know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel it’s right\nTo legalize it or for a state to declare it as legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because the constitution says separation of church and state\nIt’s clearly stated\nClearly stated\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to control it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people trying to make it illegal\nI think that’s really choosing one church’s beliefs over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it\nAnd don’t support it except for in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to make illegal or legal\n\nUh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh, a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they might plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it wouldn’t have\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq, and I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war, especially for a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is like a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. They were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government, the American government, was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\n\nUm\nAnd the government, the United States, is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy.\n\nI think the government, the US government, should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear victory, like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because, um, because there are, there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army.\n\nYou’re fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and so I think, I think that the government, first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into this war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been.\n\nI mean, really not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still, um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn’t be naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today, and there was lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, let’s see.\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because, well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started. And so, I mean, once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? So it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish, but again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? And I think the big reason for that is the oil issue, and this is where we are getting our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources. I mean, before going into war, one of the predispositions was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet’s see.\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nAnd it\nNot only affects women, but also men, depending on the field of work they're in\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling where, even when equality is supposedly there, many people struggle to place someone under a woman if they're a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, many times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but the board might not elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not common for women to be in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd the same applies to men\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent\nIt's really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a stay-at-home parent who's a man\nAnd many people look down upon that because society thinks, well you're a man, you should be working and making money\nWhy are you staying at home?\nIt can be really hard for them because it might be their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople don't really take men seriously if they're straight\nUm\nBecause typically, men involved in fashion lead unconventional lifestyles\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man in the fashion industry, people might think, well how can I really trust you know what fashion is for women?\nLike you don't really know what we're about\nLike those other guys\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s, but change is really slow\nSo, I feel like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are moving into higher positions and becoming CEOs, and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as with stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working\nAnd um\nFor fashion people, they might be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nSo they do know what I'm talking about\nSo I guess you kinda have to promote it by highlighting the good qualities of people who are typically stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but rather saying their good qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it.\nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket.\nYou know something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that.\nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited then for job interviews and all sorts of things like that,\nThose types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be a concern.\nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge.\nAt least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.\nBut at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and then to house them and then to let them go.\nAnd then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times.\nAnd then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges.\nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do.\nAnd I mean so,\nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.\nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that.\nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more liberal, then I think it’s totally fine.\nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education.\nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people.\nUm so it’s important, cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere.\nAll over the streets and stuff.\nUm I mean for a variety of reasons,\nBut there’s this whole financial element to it as well.\nOther reasons like why it shouldn’t necessarily,\nWell no, I mean I I don’t know how I would feel about,\nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.\nThen I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving.\nAnd um, it still is like taboo in our society,\nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts,\nUh to smoke marijuana.\nSo to have it out in the open like that,\nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people.\nUm and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um I don’t really know. Um I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah. Uh no I don’t",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nUm\nI guess\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nUm\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nUm\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nUm\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless\n\nNope",
            "Um\nI don't\nI haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet\nSo\nI can't say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don't know, I think\nI think that all civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament, like considered\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nBe looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got united together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "**\nI was raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. Nevertheless, I believe it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Clearly, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. You know, because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI sort of already answered that, but\nYes, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to\nDecide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n**",
            "Um\nNo, I don't in the slightest\nUm\nLet's see\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever it is you're trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious choice. So I think people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like it's so much a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a personal choice. I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue either. Again, I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.\nBecause\nWell, basically, there’s not a good reason not to.\nUm\nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\nBut\nIt’s so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same.\nIt’s just\nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin.\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt’s like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don’t want to say next of kin\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is\nBut\nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick\nAnd\nCan’t visit\n‘Cause they’re not technically family\nAnd\nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days\nAnd\nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is\nUm\nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\nAnd\nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue\nBecause\nI can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal\nYeah\nThey are\nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they’ll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent’s\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt’s kind of hard to say\nI’m not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of gay parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt’s just a kid\nI mean\nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it’s just about personality choices\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking gay marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on gay marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI’m not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently\nNope",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. So, as far as making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But, if we're talking about using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. Because marijuana, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can also lead to bad things. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say not that you could integrate it, let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nUh, yeah. Um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Um, so, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope",

            "English translation:\n(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war really gets under my skin.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration lied openly to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean I think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\nUm\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don’t feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don’t like keep up with it\nI don’t know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel it’s right\nTo legalize it or for a state to declare it as legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because the constitution says separation of church and state\nIt’s clearly stated\nClearly stated\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to control it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people trying to make it illegal\nI think that’s really choosing one church’s beliefs over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it\nAnd don’t support it except for in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to make illegal or legal\n\nUh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh, a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they might plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it wouldn’t have\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq, and I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war, especially for a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is like a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. They were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government, the American government, was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\n\nUm\nAnd the government, the United States, is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy.\n\nI think the government, the US government, should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear victory, like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because, um, because there are, there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army.\n\nYou’re fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and so I think, I think that the government, first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into this war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been.\n\nI mean, really not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still, um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn’t be naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today, and there was lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, let’s see.\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because, well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started. And so, I mean, once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? So it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish, but again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? And I think the big reason for that is the oil issue, and this is where we are getting our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources. I mean, before going into war, one of the predispositions was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet’s see.\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nAnd it\nNot only affects women, but also men, depending on the field of work they're in\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling where, even when equality is supposedly there, many people struggle to place someone under a woman if they're a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, many times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but the board might not elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not common for women to be in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd the same applies to men\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent\nIt's really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a stay-at-home parent who's a man\nAnd many people look down upon that because society thinks, well you're a man, you should be working and making money\nWhy are you staying at home?\nIt can be really hard for them because it might be their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople don't really take men seriously if they're straight\nUm\nBecause typically, men involved in fashion lead unconventional lifestyles\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man in the fashion industry, people might think, well how can I really trust you know what fashion is for women?\nLike you don't really know what we're about\nLike those other guys\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s, but change is really slow\nSo, I feel like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are moving into higher positions and becoming CEOs, and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as with stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working\nAnd um\nFor fashion people, they might be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nSo they do know what I'm talking about\nSo I guess you kinda have to promote it by highlighting the good qualities of people who are typically stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but rather saying their good qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it.\nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket.\nYou know something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that.\nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited then for job interviews and all sorts of things like that,\nThose types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be a concern.\nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge.\nAt least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.\nBut at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and then to house them and then to let them go.\nAnd then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times.\nAnd then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges.\nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do.\nAnd I mean so,\nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.\nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that.\nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more liberal, then I think it’s totally fine.\nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education.\nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people.\nUm so it’s important, cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere.\nAll over the streets and stuff.\nUm I mean for a variety of reasons,\nBut there’s this whole financial element to it as well.\nOther reasons like why it shouldn’t necessarily,\nWell no, I mean I I don’t know how I would feel about,\nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.\nThen I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving.\nAnd um, it still is like taboo in our society,\nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts,\nUh to smoke marijuana.\nSo to have it out in the open like that,\nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people.\nUm and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um I don’t really know. Um I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah. Uh no I don’t",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nUm\nI guess\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nUm\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nUm\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nUm\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless\n\nNope",
            "Um\nI don't\nI haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet\nSo\nI can't say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don't know, I think\nI think that all civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament, like considered\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nBe looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got united together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "**\nI was raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. Nevertheless, I believe it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Clearly, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. You know, because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI sort of already answered that, but\nYes, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to\nDecide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n**",
            "Um\nNo, I don't in the slightest\nUm\nLet's see\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever it is you're trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
