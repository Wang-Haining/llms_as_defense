            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there is no valid reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are so many factors to consider that it cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin - heads can never be tails, but they are essentially the same. There are various civil rights associated with this, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner cannot be present if you are sick, as they are not technically considered family. I think this is absurd if you are spending the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. What many people seem to get hung up on is that homosexuals are not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather a legal marriage certificate provided by the government. If there is no involvement with church and state, this shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why people like Catholics would object to this on religious grounds, as it is a legal matter. If you are allowing someone a civil union, why not also allow them a legal marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should reflect this. However, I think President Bush has strong views on this matter, and his stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard against it are moral, but morality differs from person to person. To embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while considering recent controversies such as the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but this is not a valid reason. The American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue. Institutions that actually do research should be listened to instead of popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties. So, I’d say no to making it available to the public. Absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I’d say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it’s beneficial; it’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial. And if you deny that, just because there’s a taboo around marijuana, then there’s no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things. It’s a tough one. I’d say you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused, but if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it’s an illegal drug. But I mean, it’s not that bad for you. It’s not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I remember growing up, I would always go to church every Sunday and wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there on the weekends. Now, as I've gotten older, they've started a teenager's mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during the summer. Families often come in late, so I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to get dressed up, people now wear jeans and khakis. I think the biggest change I've noticed is that the church I know doesn't involve me in its politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by changing policies like allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. It's the individual, not the policies. I think that if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should consider a different faith. The sexuality of these priests might be based on genetics, not how they were brought up. I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening if they didn't know about it and were trying to cover it up. Shame on them if they did know and didn't act. As for other thoughts, I don't have any.",
            "(laughs)\n\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still very much shaken by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq based on flimsy pretexts. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still upsets me. It seems to me that the Bush administration was very open about deceiving the American people and has yet to take responsibility. Even Colin Powell, who later admitted that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the UN, called it a mistake.\n\nThat’s an impeachable offense, in my opinion. The Bush administration has shown complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of office, but it seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his father’s administration. I think he also aimed to secure our energy supply, which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI think we should have pulled out a long time ago. Pulling out now could lead to a civil war, which would result in more deaths. The alternative proposed by the UN and the US, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the best idea because it could also lead to long-term issues regarding Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, and the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister lacks control, and radical elements are vying for power.",

Und ich denke, es war eher eine große Reaktion gegen den Irak, weil man annahm, dass er die USA angegriffen hat. Wie die Terroristen, die die Anschläge am 11. September verübt haben. Also, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak, also halte ich mich nicht auf dem Laufenden. Ich kenne die großen Details nicht, aber ich weiß, dass wir dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, die Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es so etwas wie die USA wird, und außerdem, um Öl und so weiter von ihnen zu bekommen. Aber das ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt. Also, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann müssen wir versuchen, die Demokratie zu schaffen, was sowieso ewig dauern wird, da man Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufbauen kann. Und wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen von vorne anfangen. Um, lass mich sehen, oh, das ist so schwer. Das ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß. Um, Krieg im Irak. Oh, das ist schwer. Uh. Mmm. Uhh, ich weiß nicht. Hast du noch etwas anderes, über das ich sprechen könnte? Ok. Danke. Um. Also, ich denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist. Ich denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen. Aber, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen, dass wir stark und Amerikaner sind und so weiter. Aber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund dafür gibt, es noch als Krieg zu bezeichnen, weil es sowieso nie erklärt wurde. Man muss den Krieg vom Kongress erklären, und dann ist es, dass ich denke, dass es das nicht mehr wert ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen. Aber es ist auch, als ob wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden. Und besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob er wie einer der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussieht, weil von dem, was es tut, und es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob. Und dann, erinnere dich an die ganze Vietnam-Sache, der Vietnam-Krieg war ein undeclared war und ist jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet. Und er wird wahrscheinlich so bezeichnet werden, als einer der Präsidenten, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg begann und so weiter. Also, huh, du musst eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? Uh, Ok ja, um, huh, ich schätze, du könntest auch sagen, dass es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden will, weil es so viele Familien gibt, die ich kenne, deren Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind, und es ist so, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, wegen der Tatsache, dass du weißt, dass du die Menschen dort leben lässt und wir haben sie zerstört, weil wir sie jetzt dort haben und ich denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr ein Schulgebäude, weil es so unsicher ist und all die kleinen Gruppen innerhalb von Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten, nur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben. Aber dann wieder ist es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, ich will sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie mehr und mehr zu uns zu formen, und es wird noch schlimmer für sie werden, und es wird so sein, dass ich denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegen die USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern, und sie haben so lange eine totalitäre Diktatur gehabt, dass ich denke, dass es uns am Ende schadet, wenn wir dort bleiben.

I feel that attempting to impose any kind of power over this issue would be against what has already been written in the constitution. I believe those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in areas like Boston. I don’t think it’s the government’s place to decide what churches can and can’t make illegal. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Even if an amendment were to be made, I think it would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. I really feel it’s up to the churches, not the president or anyone in government, to decide this. There isn’t a good reason for an amendment banning it, as I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society positively.",
            "Ok, the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government exploited the public's outrage against the attacks to push for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI myself am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, is reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the high number of American soldiers who died. They removed Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. The United States was attempting to install a democratic government, similar to their efforts in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and duration of the process.\n\nI believe the government was not adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We are still there, at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. The long process of training Iraqi troops and police forces is ongoing. The government may have tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. Implementing a new form of government takes years and is not an easy process, as seen in our own history.\n\nThe decision to go to war is difficult. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken away their government and way of life. However, we also need to consider the high risk and cost to American lives. Moreover, if the goal is to create a democratic nation, why just Iraq? The main reason is likely oil, as it's a significant source of our energy. The government's claims of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false, unlike in the case of North Korea, where we know they exist but have not attacked.\n\nI hope that this war ends soon and that there will be peace, but I doubt that will happen.",

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged for too long. Initially, the purpose was good, which was to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have lost sight of that purpose and are now fighting for the sake of proving our power. I think the original motivation had questionable aspects, such as George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be justifiable, but if personal matters were involved, it would not be fair. I believe the war has been prolonged too much. Initially, starting the war was a clear statement, but it has dragged on for over a year now. If our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I don't think our reason has remained consistent over time; it seems we are still at war just to be at war, and we don't want to leave without a decisive victory. I think the war has gone on long enough and should stop. There comes a point when the country's officials must fend for themselves. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions of dollars on this war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty. This war is a long-term drain on our economy. We should be spending that money on improving our own country, such as fixing roads and schools, and addressing healthcare issues. Right now, that money is being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it was reduced from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—something you might get cited for instead of being booked and arrested. When someone gets caught and cited for it, there are still potential ramifications, such as issues with job interviews and other formal situations, which are usually the worst effects of a drug charge. At least with a marijuana charge, people often worry about these long-term effects, even if it's decriminalized.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that arresting and processing people can be expensive. It involves costs for booking, housing, court proceedings, and legal representation. Municipalities facing financial difficulties might not be willing to take on these additional expenses, even if it could free up funding for other public needs. In a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might be accepted. Here, the city might have more money to spend on education, social programs, and food assistance for the homeless due to the financial benefits.\n\nI don't think everyone wants marijuana to be widely available and smoked everywhere, as it could be awkward and not socially accepted in many places. Additionally, it's hard to generalize about the effects of substances like marijuana and alcohol. They both have adverse effects on people, and individuals react differently based on their personal characteristics. Some people might use substances moderately, while others might not. Ultimately, both substances can have negative impacts, but how they affect each other can vary greatly from person to person.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of the things they do are very traditional. They've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. That’s not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So because it’s just a different realm. I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",

However, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel that it should be decided by each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you should disagree with a state's decision if they choose to legalize it, as you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel like it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI've already answered that. But I don't feel like Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush lives in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was in favor of going over there and creating as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was in favor of it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike I don’t think our presence over there is going to do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were going to face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because for them, war is very different than for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there is no valid reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are so many factors to consider that it cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin - heads can never be tails, but they are essentially the same. There are various civil rights associated with this, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner cannot be present if you are sick, as they are not technically considered family. I think this is absurd if you are spending the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. What many people seem to get hung up on is that homosexuals are not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather a legal marriage certificate provided by the government. If there is no involvement with church and state, this shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why people like Catholics would object to this on religious grounds, as it is a legal matter. If you are allowing someone a civil union, why not also allow them a legal marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should reflect this. However, I think President Bush has strong views on this matter, and his stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard against it are moral, but morality differs from person to person. To embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while considering recent controversies such as the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but this is not a valid reason. The American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue. Institutions that actually do research should be listened to instead of popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties. So, I’d say no to making it available to the public. Absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I’d say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it’s beneficial; it’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial. And if you deny that, just because there’s a taboo around marijuana, then there’s no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things. It’s a tough one. I’d say you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused, but if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it’s an illegal drug. But I mean, it’s not that bad for you. It’s not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I remember growing up, I would always go to church every Sunday and wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there on the weekends. Now, as I've gotten older, they've started a teenager's mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during the summer. Families often come in late, so I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to get dressed up, people now wear jeans and khakis. I think the biggest change I've noticed is that the church I know doesn't involve me in its politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by changing policies like allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. It's the individual, not the policies. I think that if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should consider a different faith. The sexuality of these priests might be based on genetics, not how they were brought up. I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening if they didn't know about it and were trying to cover it up. Shame on them if they did know and didn't act. As for other thoughts, I don't have any.",
            "(laughs)\n\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still very much shaken by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq based on flimsy pretexts. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still upsets me. It seems to me that the Bush administration was very open about deceiving the American people and has yet to take responsibility. Even Colin Powell, who later admitted that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the UN, called it a mistake.\n\nThat’s an impeachable offense, in my opinion. The Bush administration has shown complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of office, but it seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his father’s administration. I think he also aimed to secure our energy supply, which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI think we should have pulled out a long time ago. Pulling out now could lead to a civil war, which would result in more deaths. The alternative proposed by the UN and the US, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the best idea because it could also lead to long-term issues regarding Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, and the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister lacks control, and radical elements are vying for power.",

Tut mir leid\nOk\nWie ich über den Krieg im Irak denke\nLass mich sehen\nUm\nAn diesem Punkt fühle ich, dass es eher sinnlos ist, weil ich meine, es wurde ja gar nicht wirklich erklärt. Und ich denke, es war eher eine große Reaktion gegen den Irak, weil man annahm, dass er die USA angegriffen hat. Wie die Terroristen, die die Anschläge am 11. September verübt haben. Also, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak, also halte ich mich nicht auf dem Laufenden. Ich kenne die großen Details nicht, aber ich weiß, dass wir dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, die Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es so etwas wie die USA wird, und außerdem, um Öl und so weiter von ihnen zu bekommen. Aber das ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt. Also, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann müssen wir versuchen, die Demokratie zu schaffen, was sowieso ewig dauern wird, da man Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufbauen kann. Und wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen von vorne anfangen. Um, lass mich sehen, oh, das ist so schwer. Das ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß. Um, Krieg im Irak. Oh, das ist schwer. Uh. Mmm. Uhh, ich weiß nicht. Hast du noch etwas anderes, über das ich sprechen könnte? Ok. Danke. Um. Also, ich denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist. Ich denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen. Aber, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen, dass wir stark und Amerikaner sind und so weiter. Aber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund dafür gibt, es noch als Krieg zu bezeichnen, weil es sowieso nie erklärt wurde. Man muss den Krieg vom Kongress erklären, und dann ist es, dass ich denke, dass es das nicht mehr wert ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen. Aber es ist auch, als ob wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden. Und besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob er wie einer der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussieht, weil von dem, was es tut, und es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob. Und dann, erinnere dich an die ganze Vietnam-Sache, der Vietnam-Krieg war ein undeclared war und ist jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet. Und er wird wahrscheinlich so bezeichnet werden, als einer der Präsidenten, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg begann und so weiter. Also, huh, du musst eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? Uh, Ok ja, um, huh, ich schätze, du könntest auch sagen, dass es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden will, weil es so viele Familien gibt, die ich kenne, deren Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind, und es ist so, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, wegen der Tatsache, dass du weißt, dass du die Menschen dort leben lässt und wir haben sie zerstört, weil wir sie jetzt dort haben und ich denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr ein Schulgebäude, weil es so unsicher ist und all die kleinen Gruppen innerhalb von Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten, nur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben. Aber dann wieder ist es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, ich will sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie mehr und mehr zu uns zu formen, und es wird noch schlimmer für sie werden, und es wird so sein, dass ich denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegen die USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern, und sie haben so lange eine totalitäre Diktatur gehabt, dass ich denke, dass es uns am Ende schadet, wenn wir dort bleiben.

            "I really don’t feel that it’s appropriate to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. I think it’s up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I feel that attempting to impose any kind of power over this issue would be against what has already been written in the constitution. I believe those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in areas like Boston. I don’t think it’s the government’s place to decide what churches can and can’t make illegal. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Even if an amendment were to be made, I think it would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. I really feel it’s up to the churches, not the president or anyone in government, to decide this. There isn’t a good reason for an amendment banning it, as I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society positively.",
            "Ok, the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government exploited the public's outrage against the attacks to push for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI myself am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, is reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the high number of American soldiers who died. They removed Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. The United States was attempting to install a democratic government, similar to their efforts in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and duration of the process.\n\nI believe the government was not adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We are still there, at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. The long process of training Iraqi troops and police forces is ongoing. The government may have tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. Implementing a new form of government takes years and is not an easy process, as seen in our own history.\n\nThe decision to go to war is difficult. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken away their government and way of life. However, we also need to consider the high risk and cost to American lives. Moreover, if the goal is to create a democratic nation, why just Iraq? The main reason is likely oil, as it's a significant source of our energy. The government's claims of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false, unlike in the case of North Korea, where we know they exist but have not attacked.\n\nI hope that this war ends soon and that there will be peace, but I doubt that will happen.",

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged for too long. Initially, the purpose was good, which was to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have lost sight of that purpose and are now fighting for the sake of proving our power. I think the original motivation had questionable aspects, such as George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be justifiable, but if personal matters were involved, it would not be fair. I believe the war has been prolonged too much. Initially, starting the war was a clear statement, but it has dragged on for over a year now. If our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I don't think our reason has remained consistent over time; it seems we are still at war just to be at war, and we don't want to leave without a decisive victory. I think the war has gone on long enough and should stop. There comes a point when the country's officials must fend for themselves. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions of dollars on this war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty. This war is a long-term drain on our economy. We should be spending that money on improving our own country, such as fixing roads and schools, and addressing healthcare issues. Right now, that money is being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOk\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their friend or something like that.\nBut you've given them permission to see your profile.\nSo whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\nUm\nI mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation they came across.\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm\nThis man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily.\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me.\nAnd it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like.\nSometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don't want to limit it too much.\nSo it's a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo...\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think\nI don't really know how they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it was reduced from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—something you might get cited for instead of being booked and arrested. When someone gets caught and cited for it, there are still potential ramifications, such as issues with job interviews and other formal situations, which are usually the worst effects of a drug charge. At least with a marijuana charge, people often worry about these long-term effects, even if it's decriminalized.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that arresting and processing people can be expensive. It involves costs for booking, housing, court proceedings, and legal representation. Municipalities facing financial difficulties might not be willing to take on these additional expenses, even if it could free up funding for other public needs. In a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might be accepted. Here, the city might have more money to spend on education, social programs, and food assistance for the homeless due to the financial benefits.\n\nI don't think everyone wants marijuana to be widely available and smoked everywhere, as it could be awkward and not socially accepted in many places. Additionally, it's hard to generalize about the effects of substances like marijuana and alcohol. They both have adverse effects on people, and individuals react differently based on their personal characteristics. Some people might use substances moderately, while others might not. Ultimately, both substances can have negative impacts, but how they affect each other can vary greatly from person to person.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of the things they do are very traditional. They've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. That’s not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So because it’s just a different realm. I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",

            "I was raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel that it should be decided by each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you should disagree with a state's decision if they choose to legalize it, as you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel like it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI've already answered that. But I don't feel like Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush lives in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was in favor of going over there and creating as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was in favor of it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike I don’t think our presence over there is going to do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were going to face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because for them, war is very different than for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I believe that gay marriage should be legalized because there is no valid reason not to. Many people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the traditional family, but this is not the case. There are so many factors to consider that it cannot be considered the same. It's like two sides of the same coin - heads can never be tails, but they are essentially the same. There are various civil rights associated with this, such as property taxes and healthcare, where a partner cannot be present if you are sick, as they are not technically considered family. I think this is absurd if you are spending the rest of your life with someone. Many scientific studies have shown that homosexual couples have similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as heterosexual couples. It's just a relationship, and it's the same thing. What many people seem to get hung up on is that homosexuals are not asking for the right to get married in a church, but rather a legal marriage certificate provided by the government. If there is no involvement with church and state, this shouldn't be an issue. I can't understand why people like Catholics would object to this on religious grounds, as it is a legal matter. If you are allowing someone a civil union, why not also allow them a legal marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal. I think the federal government should legalize gay marriage in every state, and the amendment should reflect this. However, I think President Bush has strong views on this matter, and his stance on gay marriage aligns with his views on abortion and stem cell research. Most of the reasons I've heard against it are moral, but morality differs from person to person. To embrace the morality of one group while ignoring the rest is unethical. It's hypocritical for the government to create an amendment banning gay marriage while considering recent controversies such as the pledge of allegiance. Many people are against gay marriage because they believe gay people are psychologically damaged, but this is not a valid reason. The American Psychological Association has stated that this is untrue. Institutions that actually do research should be listened to instead of popular opinion or religious beliefs.",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. You know, just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties. So, I’d say no to making it available to the public. Absolutely no. But for medicinal purposes, I’d say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it’s beneficial; it’s not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal but pharmacies use, like oxycodone, Vicodin, Perocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they’re beneficial. And if you deny that, just because there’s a taboo around marijuana, then there’s no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol because if you abuse marijuana, although if you abuse alcohol too, that can lead to bad things. It’s a tough one. I’d say you could integrate it, like let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused, but if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly.\n\nYeah, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it’s an illegal drug. But I mean, it’s not that bad for you. It’s not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. So, I mean, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope.",
            "I think the church has already changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I remember growing up, I would always go to church every Sunday and wear cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I would see all my friends there on the weekends. Now, as I've gotten older, they've started a teenager's mass that's only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially during the summer. Families often come in late, so I think it has become more casual. Even at the morning masses where I used to get dressed up, people now wear jeans and khakis. I think the biggest change I've noticed is that the church I know doesn't involve me in its politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, I don't think these could have been prevented by changing policies like allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have an attraction towards young kids. It's the individual, not the policies. I think that if they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time, they should consider a different faith. The sexuality of these priests might be based on genetics, not how they were brought up. I don't think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening if they didn't know about it and were trying to cover it up. Shame on them if they did know and didn't act. As for other thoughts, I don't have any.",
            "(laughs)\n\nInitially, I was okay with the premise, but I think everyone was still very much shaken by the September 11th attacks, and I think we went into Iraq based on flimsy pretexts. Early on, the Bush administration linked the Iraq war to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be false.\n\nThat really rubbed me the wrong way, and the Iraq war still upsets me. It seems to me that the Bush administration was very open about deceiving the American people and has yet to take responsibility. Even Colin Powell, who later admitted that he wasn’t convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the UN, called it a mistake.\n\nThat’s an impeachable offense, in my opinion. The Bush administration has shown complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to undermine it since September 11th at least. I think they came into office with the intent to go to war.\n\nI can’t remember the name of the Secretary of the Treasury who made that allegation in his book after he was likely forced out of office, but it seems that the younger Bush had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, possibly due to his father’s administration. I think he also aimed to secure our energy supply, which is a very underhanded approach.\n\nI think we should have pulled out a long time ago. Pulling out now could lead to a civil war, which would result in more deaths. The alternative proposed by the UN and the US, a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, might not be the best idea because it could also lead to long-term issues regarding Iraq’s sovereignty. The interim government seems to be falling apart, and the Parliament isn’t very effective. The Prime Minister lacks control, and radical elements are vying for power.",

Tut mir leid\nOk\nWie ich über den Krieg im Irak denke\nLass mich sehen\nUm\nAn diesem Punkt fühle ich, dass es eher sinnlos ist, weil ich meine, es wurde ja gar nicht wirklich erklärt. Und ich denke, es war eher eine große Reaktion gegen den Irak, weil man annahm, dass er die USA angegriffen hat. Wie die Terroristen, die die Anschläge am 11. September verübt haben. Also, ich meine, ich bin kein großer Fan des Krieges im Irak, also halte ich mich nicht auf dem Laufenden. Ich kenne die großen Details nicht, aber ich weiß, dass wir dort bleiben, um zu versuchen, die Demokratie aufzubauen, damit es so etwas wie die USA wird, und außerdem, um Öl und so weiter von ihnen zu bekommen. Aber das ist kein Grund, dort zu bleiben, weil es alle aufregt. Also, wenn wir dort bleiben, dann müssen wir versuchen, die Demokratie zu schaffen, was sowieso ewig dauern wird, da man Demokratie nicht in einem Tag aufbauen kann. Und wenn wir dann gehen, werden sie wütend auf uns sein, weil wir alles durcheinandergebracht haben und sie müssen von vorne anfangen. Um, lass mich sehen, oh, das ist so schwer. Das ist das einzige Thema, über das ich nichts weiß. Um, Krieg im Irak. Oh, das ist schwer. Uh. Mmm. Uhh, ich weiß nicht. Hast du noch etwas anderes, über das ich sprechen könnte? Ok. Danke. Um. Also, ich denke, der Krieg sollte weitergehen, weil es nicht fair ist. Ich denke, wir sollten es nicht mehr als Krieg bezeichnen. Aber, ich denke, der einzige Grund, warum wir Waffen und so weiter verwenden, ist, um zu zeigen, dass wir stark und Amerikaner sind und so weiter. Aber ich fühle mich nicht so, als ob es einen großen Grund dafür gibt, es noch als Krieg zu bezeichnen, weil es sowieso nie erklärt wurde. Man muss den Krieg vom Kongress erklären, und dann ist es, dass ich denke, dass es das nicht mehr wert ist, dort zu bleiben und zu versuchen, ihnen zu helfen. Aber es ist auch, als ob wir unsere Ressourcen verschwenden. Und besonders jetzt fühle ich mich so schlecht für Bush, weil es so ist, als ob er wie einer der schlechtesten Präsidenten der USA aussieht, weil von dem, was es tut, und es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob, und weil es tut, als ob. Und dann, erinnere dich an die ganze Vietnam-Sache, der Vietnam-Krieg war ein undeclared war und ist jetzt als sinnloser Krieg bezeichnet. Und er wird wahrscheinlich so bezeichnet werden, als einer der Präsidenten, der diesen sinnlosen Krieg begann und so weiter. Also, huh, du musst eine halbe Stunde machen, oder? Uh, Ok ja, um, huh, ich schätze, du könntest auch sagen, dass es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, dass ich den Krieg beenden will, weil es so viele Familien gibt, die ich kenne, deren Söhne und Töchter in Irak sind, und es ist so, als ob ich will, dass er weitergeht, wegen der Tatsache, dass du weißt, dass du die Menschen dort leben lässt und wir haben sie zerstört, weil wir sie jetzt dort haben und ich denke, einige der Kinder haben nicht einmal mehr ein Schulgebäude, weil es so unsicher ist und all die kleinen Gruppen innerhalb von Irak, die sich gegenseitig töten, nur weil sie unterschiedliche Überzeugungen haben. Aber dann wieder ist es, dass es schwer ist zu sagen, ich will sie dort haben, aber sie haben eine so andere Kultur als wir, dass, wenn wir dort bleiben, werden wir versuchen, sie mehr und mehr zu uns zu formen, und es wird noch schlimmer für sie werden, und es wird so sein, dass ich denke, die ganze Al-Kaida-Sache wird nur noch wachsen und ihre Abneigung gegen die USA wird nur noch wachsen, weil wir jetzt versuchen, sie zu ändern, und sie haben so lange eine totalitäre Diktatur gehabt, dass ich denke, dass es uns am Ende schadet, wenn wir dort bleiben.

            "I really don’t feel that it’s appropriate to make it legal or for a state to declare it legal. I think it’s up to the churches, as the constitution clearly states the separation of church and state. I feel that attempting to impose any kind of power over this issue would be against what has already been written in the constitution. I believe those trying to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over others, as most Catholics and Christians are against it, except in areas like Boston. I don’t think it’s the government’s place to decide what churches can and can’t make illegal. The separation of church and state is a key aspect of the constitution, promoting religious tolerance in the United States. Even if an amendment were to be made, I think it would be wrong and contradictory to what’s already written. Plus, I believe it would be one of the few amendments used to restrict people rather than the government. I don’t think the federal government or any government should be involved in this issue. I don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment, except that it’s against his personal beliefs as a Catholic. His push for this amendment shows a preference for one religion over others. I really feel it’s up to the churches, not the president or anyone in government, to decide this. There isn’t a good reason for an amendment banning it, as I don’t see how it would impact the economy or society positively.",
            "Ok, the war in Iraq.\n\nWell, to start from the beginning, I don't think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war before invading Iraq. They tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which, in reality, had little to do with each other. The government exploited the public's outrage against the attacks to push for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nI myself am strongly against war, especially preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, is reminiscent of the Vietnam War. The government should have learned from past mistakes, such as the high number of American soldiers who died. They removed Iraq's government without being prepared for the aftermath, including the power vacuum and chaos that ensued. The United States was attempting to install a democratic government, similar to their efforts in Vietnam. However, the government underestimated the difficulty and duration of the process.\n\nI believe the government was not adequately prepared for what would happen after removing the Iraqi government. We are still there, at the end of 2006, and American troops are still dying. The long process of training Iraqi troops and police forces is ongoing. The government may have tried to deceive the American people into believing it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. Implementing a new form of government takes years and is not an easy process, as seen in our own history.\n\nThe decision to go to war is difficult. It's hard to abandon the people we've taken away their government and way of life. However, we also need to consider the high risk and cost to American lives. Moreover, if the goal is to create a democratic nation, why just Iraq? The main reason is likely oil, as it's a significant source of our energy. The government's claims of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction turned out to be false, unlike in the case of North Korea, where we know they exist but have not attacked.\n\nI hope that this war ends soon and that there will be peace, but I doubt that will happen.",

            "I feel like the war has been prolonged for too long. Initially, the purpose was good, which was to restore democracy in another country. However, I believe we have lost sight of that purpose and are now fighting for the sake of proving our power. I think the original motivation had questionable aspects, such as George Bush's father's previous disputes with Saddam Hussein. If the intention was to bring democracy to a country without a fair political system, that would be justifiable, but if personal matters were involved, it would not be fair. I believe the war has been prolonged too much. Initially, starting the war was a clear statement, but it has dragged on for over a year now. If our purpose was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a just cause for war. However, I don't think our reason has remained consistent over time; it seems we are still at war just to be at war, and we don't want to leave without a decisive victory. I think the war has gone on long enough and should stop. There comes a point when the country's officials must fend for themselves. We've been draining our own economy by spending billions of dollars on this war while facing our own domestic issues like poverty. This war is a long-term drain on our economy. We should be spending that money on improving our own country, such as fixing roads and schools, and addressing healthcare issues. Right now, that money is being spent to kill our own citizens in a war we've lost the cause for. I think that's it.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify that?\n\nUh, it was prevented because someone went online and found that there was like...\n\nOk\nUm\nNo, I don't think that's an invasion of privacy.\nOn sites like Myspace, if you post information on the internet, it's pretty much available for everyone to see.\nAnd I understand that on Myspace, you know, you have to have someone else be a member to see someone's profile, and you might need to be their friend or something like that.\nBut you've given them permission to see your profile.\nSo whenever you put information on the internet, you pretty much have to understand that a lot of people are going to see that.\nSo if I think that was actually good, that somebody saw that and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHum\nUm\nThat's tough because, I mean, obviously you can't have one person sitting around all day looking at everybody's different profiles of all the students in the school to prevent that.\nBut then it becomes some sort of discrimination if they think, \"Let's look at the bad kids and make sure they're not up to anything.\"\nUm\nI mean, I don't think it would really be right to have somebody's job be to look at people's profiles.\nBut I guess it all depends on the situation they came across.\nOr was someone just randomly looking at people's profiles and just randomly happened to see that?\nOr were they actually looking for some sort of evidence that the student was planning something?\nSo I don't really know.\n\nSure\nUm\nWell, like, I don't have a Myspace personally, but I do have a Facebook.\nIt bothers me that I know there are creepy people out there who can see things about me.\nAnd I saw something on TV once about this.\nUm\nThis man who just tried to prove how he can get information so easily.\nAnd he went onto this girl's profile and got her screen name right away and was talking to her on instant messenger in like less than a minute and got her to meet with him.\nAnd I mean, personally, I certainly wouldn't meet with someone.\nBut I have had people in my classes who I don't recognize their screen names, but they IM me and they know that it's me.\nAnd it's hard because you think they know your interests, they know what you look like.\nSometimes if you put your class schedule, they know where you are during the day, who your friends are, they pretty much know a lot about you.\nAll sorts of photos.\nAnd I tried to limit what I put up there, but at the same time, the whole point, I think, the reason I have one is so I can communicate with some of my friends.\nI don't want to limit it too much.\nSo it's a tricky issue.\nBecause I only accept people I know.\nI mean, you never know really who can look at what.\nSo...\n\nHum\nUh\nWell\nI heard\nMy roommate was telling me that in her high school, there was this whole issue about how students were banned from having Myspace by the school.\nAnd\nThat struck me as a little bit strange.\nLike, I wasn't sure how high school officials had the power to tell their students they weren't allowed to have a Myspace.\n\nAnd\nI don't know if that's really a privacy issue, but I think\nI don't really know how they had the right to tell people.\n\nThat's the only other thought I can think of.\n\nYes.",

            "My understanding is that they did not legalize it; they decriminalized it. This means it was reduced from a criminal offense to something more like a traffic ticket—something you might get cited for instead of being booked and arrested. When someone gets caught and cited for it, there are still potential ramifications, such as issues with job interviews and other formal situations, which are usually the worst effects of a drug charge. At least with a marijuana charge, people often worry about these long-term effects, even if it's decriminalized.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that arresting and processing people can be expensive. It involves costs for booking, housing, court proceedings, and legal representation. Municipalities facing financial difficulties might not be willing to take on these additional expenses, even if it could free up funding for other public needs. In a place like Denver, where people are more open-minded, it might be accepted. Here, the city might have more money to spend on education, social programs, and food assistance for the homeless due to the financial benefits.\n\nI don't think everyone wants marijuana to be widely available and smoked everywhere, as it could be awkward and not socially accepted in many places. Additionally, it's hard to generalize about the effects of substances like marijuana and alcohol. They both have adverse effects on people, and individuals react differently based on their personal characteristics. Some people might use substances moderately, while others might not. Ultimately, both substances can have negative impacts, but how they affect each other can vary greatly from person to person.",
            "I would say yes, because a lot of the things they do are very traditional. They've done the same things for long periods of time, and it's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to be adaptable to change. I guess a lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week, and they're very strict on how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the doctrine to a tee, and they don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics. They also don’t accept people of other religions. Like, for example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian, and they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad’s religion. That’s not really like being tolerant of other religions. We always learned to love others, that's a Catholic teaching, but it’s hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them in that way. So I feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things, but then the Catholic practice goes against it because it’s so outdated, but they continue to stick with it anyway. I don’t think that would necessarily influence it. I mean, I personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry, but I don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their pedophilic behavior. So because it’s just a different realm. I probably don’t think that that would be an issue. Well, I guess like, people who molest children probably would do that regardless of whether they had a spouse or not, because it’s a child which is different than a spouse. So if you’re going to do something like that, you’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married. Like, I don’t think allowing priests to be married would prevent those things from happening. I think that would probably happen regardless.",

            "I was raised in a Christian family, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me. I have many gay friends, but I don't necessarily agree with their lifestyle. However, I believe that it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. I feel that it should be decided by each state rather than the president deciding for the whole country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Democratic states will likely push for gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you should disagree with a state's decision if they choose to legalize it, as you chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel like it should be legalized based on each state's discretion.\n\nI've already answered that. But I don't feel like Bush should be able to decide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it. I don't think Bush lives in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state runs itself. I think some things should be left up to each individual state, as they're the ones who will have to live with the decision. Plus, he'll be out of office in two years.

            "Ok\nUm\nThe war\nUm\nAt first I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by 9/11\nUm\nI was in favor of going over there and creating as much chaos as they did here\nUm\nI do think that since it was such an emotional event\nI think we overlooked a lot of things and didn’t really think about the long-term consequences\nAnd we kind of just went over there unprepared without a plan\nAnd um\nI really think that it backfired on us\nUm\nI uh\nI was in favor of it\nBut now I'm very against it\nI don’t think it did anything\nUm\nI think the people over there\nAs long as they’re fighting with each other, they can’t be fighting with us too\nLike I don’t think our presence over there is going to do anything if they\nIf they can’t even get along with themselves\nSo um\nLike unfortunately because of 9/11, I’ve almost just\nI just don’t care about what goes on over there\nUm\nWith those people\nI just don’t care\nI just think\nI don’t think that\nSometimes I don’t think they’re human\nI don’t know\nLike they fight with each other and they can’t\nThey just can’t do anything themselves\nSo I really don’t care\nUm\nI don’t know\nWe definitely went over there just unprepared\nWe didn’t know what we were going to face over there\nUm\nAnd it’s also bad because for them, war is very different than for us\nThey’re just like savage people when it comes to war and I don’t think that they’re looking to better their country\nI just think they’re looking to get us out of there\nAnd I think that should be fine for us\nI think we should just leave and that's really it\nUm\nWe just\nI think we were just more like\nJust hyped up than anything\nI don’t think we were thinking rationally about like what this could lead to or how they would react if we went in there and tried to change their whole lifestyle\nUm\nI just\nWe pretty much just went over there looking for revenge I think and I think President Bush just went over there because pretty much the people wanted to go over there because of what happened\nAnd um\nAlso I think he kind of took it upon himself to just declare war on Iraq\nUm\nBut at the time I see where he was coming from\nWe really\nI don’t think we had a choice but to declare war on Iraq because they can’t just do that and then us just say ok let’s rebuild and that’s it\nSo\nUm\nI don’t think we could have let it go\nBut I think we could have just had a better plan of what we were gonna do\nI don’t think they were very clear on what we were supposed to do in terms of I guess like creating order\nAnd I don’t know\nI just think that they didn’t\nThere was no like unity\nThey didn’t know what they were going in there for\nSo I think that would have helped us out a lot more\nBut like I said I thought it was all emotion and anger that we went in there with\nSo that’s what we created in turn in there\nUm\nAnd\nHonestly I don’t\nI don’t think we’re the ones to change those people\nI honestly think they’re always going to be like that\nAnd um\nI don’t\nI really don’t have anything else to say\nIt’s gone on long enough\nUm\nI don’t think we’re making enough progress\nLike we’ve made progress\nBut not enough to stay in there\nAnd I think no matter how long we stay in there\nOnce we leave, it’s just gonna collapse\nAnd we can’t stay over there forever\nSo I think we’re just hurting ourselves by staying over there\nNo\nOk"
