            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious choice. So I think people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like it's so much a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a personal choice. I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue either. Again, I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.\nBecause\nWell, basically, there’s not a good reason not to.\nUm\nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\nBut\nIt’s so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same.\nIt’s just\nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin.\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt’s like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don’t want to say next of kin\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is\nBut\nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick\nAnd\nCan’t visit\n‘Cause they’re not technically family\nAnd\nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days\nAnd\nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is\nUm\nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\nAnd\nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue\nBecause\nI can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal\nYeah\nThey are\nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they’ll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent’s\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt’s kind of hard to say\nI’m not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of gay parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt’s just a kid\nI mean\nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it’s just about personality choices\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking gay marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on gay marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI’m not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently\nNope",

I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean I think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\nUm\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don’t feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don’t like keep up with it\nI don’t know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel it’s right\nTo legalize it or for a state to declare it as legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because the constitution says separation of church and state\nIt’s clearly stated\nClearly stated\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to control it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people trying to make it illegal\nI think that’s really choosing one church’s beliefs over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it\nAnd don’t support it except for in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to make illegal or legal\n\nUh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh, a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they might plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it wouldn’t have\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq, and I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war, especially for a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is like a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. They were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government, the American government, was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\n\nUm\nAnd the government, the United States, is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy.\n\nI think the government, the US government, should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear victory, like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because, um, because there are, there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army.\n\nYou’re fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and so I think, I think that the government, first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into this war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been.\n\nI mean, really not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still, um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn’t be naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today, and there was lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, let’s see.\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because, well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started. And so, I mean, once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? So it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish, but again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? And I think the big reason for that is the oil issue, and this is where we are getting our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources. I mean, before going into war, one of the predispositions was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet’s see.\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nAnd it\nNot only affects women, but also men, depending on the field of work they're in\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling where, even when equality is supposedly there, many people struggle to place someone under a woman if they're a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, many times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but the board might not elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not common for women to be in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd the same applies to men\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent\nIt's really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a stay-at-home parent who's a man\nAnd many people look down upon that because society thinks, well you're a man, you should be working and making money\nWhy are you staying at home?\nIt can be really hard for them because it might be their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople don't really take men seriously if they're straight\nUm\nBecause typically, men involved in fashion lead unconventional lifestyles\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man in the fashion industry, people might think, well how can I really trust you know what fashion is for women?\nLike you don't really know what we're about\nLike those other guys\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s, but change is really slow\nSo, I feel like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are moving into higher positions and becoming CEOs, and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as with stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working\nAnd um\nFor fashion people, they might be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nSo they do know what I'm talking about\nSo I guess you kinda have to promote it by highlighting the good qualities of people who are typically stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but rather saying their good qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it.\nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket.\nYou know something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that.\nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited then for job interviews and all sorts of things like that,\nThose types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be a concern.\nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge.\nAt least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.\nBut at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and then to house them and then to let them go.\nAnd then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times.\nAnd then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges.\nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do.\nAnd I mean so,\nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.\nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that.\nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more liberal, then I think it’s totally fine.\nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education.\nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people.\nUm so it’s important, cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere.\nAll over the streets and stuff.\nUm I mean for a variety of reasons,\nBut there’s this whole financial element to it as well.\nOther reasons like why it shouldn’t necessarily,\nWell no, I mean I I don’t know how I would feel about,\nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.\nThen I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving.\nAnd um, it still is like taboo in our society,\nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts,\nUh to smoke marijuana.\nSo to have it out in the open like that,\nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people.\nUm and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um I don’t really know. Um I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah. Uh no I don’t",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nUm\nI guess\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nUm\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nUm\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nUm\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless\n\nNope",
            "Um\nI don't\nI haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet\nSo\nI can't say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don't know, I think\nI think that all civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament, like considered\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nBe looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got united together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "**\nI was raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. Nevertheless, I believe it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Clearly, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. You know, because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI sort of already answered that, but\nYes, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to\nDecide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n**",
            "Um\nNo, I don't in the slightest\nUm\nLet's see\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever it is you're trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious choice. So I think people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like it's so much a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a personal choice. I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue either. Again, I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.\nBecause\nWell, basically, there’s not a good reason not to.\nUm\nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\nBut\nIt’s so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same.\nIt’s just\nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin.\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt’s like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don’t want to say next of kin\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is\nBut\nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick\nAnd\nCan’t visit\n‘Cause they’re not technically family\nAnd\nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days\nAnd\nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is\nUm\nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\nAnd\nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue\nBecause\nI can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal\nYeah\nThey are\nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they’ll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent’s\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt’s kind of hard to say\nI’m not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of gay parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt’s just a kid\nI mean\nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it’s just about personality choices\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking gay marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on gay marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI’m not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently\nNope",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. So, as far as making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But, if we're talking about using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. Because marijuana, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can also lead to bad things. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say not that you could integrate it, let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nUh, yeah. Um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Um, so, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope",

            "English translation:\n(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war really gets under my skin.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration lied openly to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean I think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\nUm\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don’t feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don’t like keep up with it\nI don’t know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel it’s right\nTo legalize it or for a state to declare it as legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because the constitution says separation of church and state\nIt’s clearly stated\nClearly stated\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to control it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people trying to make it illegal\nI think that’s really choosing one church’s beliefs over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it\nAnd don’t support it except for in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to make illegal or legal\n\nUh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh, a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they might plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it wouldn’t have\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq, and I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war, especially for a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is like a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. They were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government, the American government, was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\n\nUm\nAnd the government, the United States, is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy.\n\nI think the government, the US government, should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear victory, like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because, um, because there are, there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army.\n\nYou’re fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and so I think, I think that the government, first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into this war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been.\n\nI mean, really not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still, um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn’t be naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today, and there was lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, let’s see.\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because, well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started. And so, I mean, once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? So it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish, but again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? And I think the big reason for that is the oil issue, and this is where we are getting our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources. I mean, before going into war, one of the predispositions was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet’s see.\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nAnd it\nNot only affects women, but also men, depending on the field of work they're in\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling where, even when equality is supposedly there, many people struggle to place someone under a woman if they're a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, many times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but the board might not elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not common for women to be in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd the same applies to men\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent\nIt's really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a stay-at-home parent who's a man\nAnd many people look down upon that because society thinks, well you're a man, you should be working and making money\nWhy are you staying at home?\nIt can be really hard for them because it might be their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople don't really take men seriously if they're straight\nUm\nBecause typically, men involved in fashion lead unconventional lifestyles\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man in the fashion industry, people might think, well how can I really trust you know what fashion is for women?\nLike you don't really know what we're about\nLike those other guys\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s, but change is really slow\nSo, I feel like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are moving into higher positions and becoming CEOs, and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as with stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working\nAnd um\nFor fashion people, they might be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nSo they do know what I'm talking about\nSo I guess you kinda have to promote it by highlighting the good qualities of people who are typically stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but rather saying their good qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it.\nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket.\nYou know something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that.\nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited then for job interviews and all sorts of things like that,\nThose types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be a concern.\nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge.\nAt least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.\nBut at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and then to house them and then to let them go.\nAnd then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times.\nAnd then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges.\nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do.\nAnd I mean so,\nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.\nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that.\nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more liberal, then I think it’s totally fine.\nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education.\nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people.\nUm so it’s important, cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere.\nAll over the streets and stuff.\nUm I mean for a variety of reasons,\nBut there’s this whole financial element to it as well.\nOther reasons like why it shouldn’t necessarily,\nWell no, I mean I I don’t know how I would feel about,\nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.\nThen I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving.\nAnd um, it still is like taboo in our society,\nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts,\nUh to smoke marijuana.\nSo to have it out in the open like that,\nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people.\nUm and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um I don’t really know. Um I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah. Uh no I don’t",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nUm\nI guess\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nUm\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nUm\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nUm\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless\n\nNope",
            "Um\nI don't\nI haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet\nSo\nI can't say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don't know, I think\nI think that all civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament, like considered\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nBe looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got united together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "**\nI was raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. Nevertheless, I believe it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Clearly, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. You know, because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI sort of already answered that, but\nYes, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to\nDecide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n**",
            "Um\nNo, I don't in the slightest\nUm\nLet's see\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever it is you're trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I'm not opposed to gay marriage. I think whether you're born that way or whatever, I don't think it's a conscious choice. So I think people shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it's wrong to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex can't. I haven't really put a lot of thought into the topic, but I would definitely say it's wrong for them to say that. It doesn't seem like it's so much a choice, like they don't really have a choice on how they are. I mean, I was born straight and another person is born gay, it doesn't seem like it's a conscious choice that they should be held responsible for. I don't think the federal government should be involved because it's more of a personal choice. I don't think it's a legal issue. I don't know if I want to call it a moral issue either. Again, I don't think these gay people should be put on a stage like they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever. So I don't think the federal government really has any say. It's hard.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized.\nBecause\nWell, basically, there’s not a good reason not to.\nUm\nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family.\nBut\nIt’s so different\nAnd\nThere are so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same.\nIt’s just\nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin.\nUm\nHeads will never be tails\nBut\nIt’s like the same thing\nAnd\nUm\nWell, there are a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it\nLike\nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where\nUm\nYour primary or your\nI don’t want to say next of kin\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is\nBut\nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick\nAnd\nCan’t visit\n‘Cause they’re not technically family\nAnd\nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone\nAnd\nA lot of scientific studies have been done\nBecause\nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days\nAnd\nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success\nThey have the same\nUm\nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing\nAnd\nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is\nUm\nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church\nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate\nA legal document provided by the government\nAnd\nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue\nBecause\nI can’t understand where people like Catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing\nBut\nIn a legal sense\nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal\nYeah\nThey are\nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that\nAnd\nPeople worry about like adoption issues\nAnd\nCommunity issues\nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community\nAnd\nEspecially about\nUm\nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society\nAnd\nWhether or not they’ll\nUm\nBe influenced by their parent’s\nUm\nSexual orientation choices or not\nBut\nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff\nBut\nIt’s kind of hard to say\nI’m not sure about the children aspect\nAbout adoption\nBecause\nI think the main drawback to that is\nUm\nHow children get treated by their peers\nAnd\nBy other adults in society\nLike in New York City I know they\nUm\nThey have special schools for children of gay parents\nBecause\nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up\nAnd\nStuff like that\nParents protest to get the child removed from their school\nAnd\nIt’s just a kid\nI mean\nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples\nAnd\nSo\nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to\nI mean it’s just about personality choices\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue\nMaking gay marriage legal in every state\nI think the amendment should just be the opposite\nBut\nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion\nWell\nHis um\nHis take on gay marriage actually um\nI think it goes along with his take on abortion\nAnd\nStem cell research which\nUm\nI think most of the reasons\nI’m not sure about this\nBecause\nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot\nBut\nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons\nAnd\nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable\nBut\nIt definitely differs from person to person\nAnd\nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and\nUm\nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical\nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account\nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy\nConsidering I mean about\nUm\nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance\nAnd\nHow people are so opposed to that\nBut\nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country\nUm\nJust one\nLots of people are anti-gay and anti-gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged\nAnd\nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents\nOr\nJust a personality defect\nAnd\nThat is also not a good reason\nBecause\nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is\nAnd\nIf people listened to\nUm\nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends\nAnd\nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church\nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently\nNope",
            "First off, I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. I mean, just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it has beneficial properties. So, as far as making it available to the public, I'd say no, absolutely no. But, if we're talking about using it for medicinal purposes, I'd say yes. Because just because a drug is illegal doesn't mean it's beneficial. It's not beneficial. You know what I mean?\n\nYeah, um, I mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use, like oxycotton, Vicodin, Percocets, that kind of thing. And those are controlled substances. But we use them all the time because they're beneficial. And if you deny that those benefits just because there's a taboo around marijuana, then there's no point in doing that for me. You should embrace its beneficial properties, I think.\n\nUm, I don't think it's that similar to alcohol. Because marijuana, if you abuse it, that can lead to bad things. But if you abuse alcohol too, that can also lead to bad things. Um, it's a tough one. I'd say not that you could integrate it, let it become legal gradually but not all at once. Because then it would be abused. But if you just remove that taboo around marijuana first, then people might use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nUh, yeah. Um, people have such a bad image of marijuana because it's an illegal drug. But I mean it's not that bad for you. It's not like heroin or cocaine or something like that. Um, so, if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing, then people might be able to use it responsibly. And certainly for medical purposes.\n\nNope",

            "English translation:\n(laughs)\nInitially, I was okay with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much affected by the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went into Iraq as a pretext. There were pretexts that led us into Iraq.\nI think that early on, the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, all of which has since proven false.\nAnd that really rubbed me the wrong way, and in general, the Iraq war really gets under my skin.\nUm\nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration lied openly to the American people and has yet to take responsibility for it.\nEven Colin Powell, coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN, now says that he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it.\nAnd to me, that's just malfeasance in office. I think that's an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that.\nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since.\nWell, since September 11th at least, I mean I think that they came into office with the intent to go to war.\nUm\nThat last part, I forget the name of the Secretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office.\nUm\nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad's administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too.\nWhich is also a very underhanded way to do things.\nWell\nI do think it's gone on long enough.\nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there's a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result.\nUm\nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like a coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order.\nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because\nUm\nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue, a major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point.\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all.\nThat um\nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happening and even Muqtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting\nI guess it was less then a year ago\nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government.\nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that.\nUm\nNone that I can articulate in polite company",
            "I did\nMmhmm\nJust talk into it?\nOk\nOk cool\nUh huh\nUh\nOk I’m sorry\nOk\nHow I feel about the War in Iraq\nLet me see\nUm\nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually\nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S.\nLike who did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven\nSo I don’t feel like\nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq\nSo I don’t like keep up with it\nI don’t know the big details of it\nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing\nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them\nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset\nSo\nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day\nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves\nUm\nLet me see\nOhh this is so hard\nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about\nUm\nWar in Iraq\nOh this hard\nUh\nMmm\nUhh I don’t know\nDo you have anything else I can go off of?\nOk\nThank you\nUm\nWell um\nActually I think\nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair\nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore\nBut because I don’t think that\nYou know\nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that\nYou know\nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns\nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore\nBecause like we didn’t even call it\nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place\nBecause it never was declared a war by congress\nI think that’s how the whole thing works\nYou have to declare a war by congress\nAnd then it’s\nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try\nActually no\nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them\nBut it’s also like wasting our resources\nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like\nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now\nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like\nAnd what it’s doing to like\nCause remember\nI think with the whole Vietnam thing\nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war\nAnd he’s like saying\nHe’ll be called like that president forever\nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff\nSo\nHuh\nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you?\nUh\nOk yeah\nUm\nHuh\nI guess you could also say that it is\nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in\nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like\nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took\nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school\nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other\nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have\nBut then again\nIt’s like\nIt’s hard to say\nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States\nThat it’s going to be even worse for them\nAnd it’s going to be\nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them\nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like\nUm\nTotalitarian\nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that\nYou know\nI feel like it’s gonna\nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there\nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years\nHmm\nThat’s about it\nOk",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel it’s right\nTo legalize it or for a state to declare it as legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because the constitution says separation of church and state\nIt’s clearly stated\nClearly stated\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to control it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it\nWould be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution\nSo\nUh\nIn terms of the people trying to make it illegal\nI think that’s really choosing one church’s beliefs over another\nBecause, as we can see, most Catholics and Christians are against it\nAnd don’t support it except for in Boston and some of those areas\nBut um\nI don’t think it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to or not allowed to make illegal or legal\n\nUh\nWell, separation of church and state is pretty much\nUh, a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what really allows for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they might plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just contradictory to what’s already been said and written there\nAnd plus, I also think that it would be one of the only amendments\nProbably, I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s right at all\nIn that aspect\n\nUh\nNo, I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd as I said before, his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else\nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by\nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have a better impact on society\nSociety than it wouldn’t have\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all",
            "Ok\nThe war in Iraq\nWell\nTo start from the beginning, I don’t think the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for the war before invading Iraq, and I think they tried to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, which really had little to do with each other. The government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage over the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The invasion of Iraq started in 2003.\n\nUm\nI\nI myself and pretty much against war, especially for a preemptive strike. I was against that.\nUm\nAnd I think that the war in Iraq is like a repeat in many ways of the Vietnam War, and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made.\n\nI mean, a tremendous amount of American soldiers have died, and that’s horrible. They were removing the country’s government and I really don’t think the government, the American government, was prepared for the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur.\n\nUm\nAnd the government, the United States, is removing the Iraqi government and trying to implant a democratic government, which is kind of similar to what they were trying to do in Vietnam. They were trying to push out Communists and uphold democracy.\n\nI think the government, the US government, should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t going to be a clear victory, like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear victory in Vietnam because, um, because there are, there are a large number of insurgents and it’s hard to put them down when you’re not fighting an actual army.\n\nYou’re fighting the citizens, the specific citizens in the country, and so I think, I think that the government, first of all, I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into this war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases, and if you are going to go to war with a country, you need to plan for all possible outcomes. I think the government was not as prepared as it should have been.\n\nI mean, really not planning for what would happen once they removed the Iraqi government. We’re still there today, almost at the end of 2006, and we’re still, um, many American troops are still dying, and they’re still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country, and it’s a long process. I just think that the US government in a way tried to deceive the American people by making them think it would be a short, successful stay in Iraq. I mean, we shouldn’t be naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and for it to become successful. I mean, in our own country, democracy was a long struggle to get to the powerful government we are today, and there was lots of tension and civil war.\n\nSo, let’s see.\nThe war in Iraq\nWell, that’s a difficult decision to make because, well, that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election, like the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote, and one of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started. And so, I mean, once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so long, how can we abandon these people? I mean, we’re the ones that took away their government and their way of life, so how can we abandon them now? So it’s probably something that we should try to see to its finish, but again, there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and how much is too much to keep risking for a free democratic Iraq. I mean, going back to the whole reason for invading Iraq, I mean, if we’re invading Iraq and making it a democratic nation, why is it just Iraq? Why aren’t we doing this to all these other countries? And I think the big reason for that is the oil issue, and this is where we are getting our oil from, and it’s usually all about money and controlling resources. I mean, before going into war, one of the predispositions was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, and no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found. And yet places like North Korea, we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them. So, I don’t think the US government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making their decisions.\n\nLet’s see.\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon and there will be peace there soon, but probably not.",

            "I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States\nAnd it\nNot only affects women, but also men, depending on the field of work they're in\nUm\nI mean, overall, I feel that women have it tougher because there's this glass ceiling where, even when equality is supposedly there, many people struggle to place someone under a woman if they're a man\nJust because of how society has been raised for so long\nAnd so, many times in the workplace, women will see a job they can reach and have all the qualifications for, but the board might not elect to promote them to that position just because historically it's not common for women to be in the upper echelons of the business world\nAnd the same applies to men\nAnd in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent\nIt's really uncommon\nUm\nTo have a stay-at-home parent who's a man\nAnd many people look down upon that because society thinks, well you're a man, you should be working and making money\nWhy are you staying at home?\nIt can be really hard for them because it might be their dream to be with the children and help raise them, and maybe the wife has the better job\nBut society looks down upon that\nAnd in the fashion industry\nUm\nPeople don't really take men seriously if they're straight\nUm\nBecause typically, men involved in fashion lead unconventional lifestyles\nAnd so, if you have the typical lifestyle and you're a man in the fashion industry, people might think, well how can I really trust you know what fashion is for women?\nLike you don't really know what we're about\nLike those other guys\nSo, depending on what field of work you're in, I feel like there's definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\nUm\nTo change it is kind of difficult because society has a set mindset, and we've definitely come a long way from the 1800s, but change is really slow\nSo, I feel like if we continue working at the pace we are now, because women are moving into higher positions and becoming CEOs, and they're getting more accepted in the business world, it's a slow process\nBut it's happening and people are starting to accept it more\nAnd just as with stay-at-home dads, it's becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait, maybe the female has the better job or she wants to be the one working\nAnd um\nFor fashion people, they might be like, oh wait, maybe they're listening to their female friends or wives and stuff\nSo they do know what I'm talking about\nSo I guess you kinda have to promote it by highlighting the good qualities of people who are typically stereotyped against, not being too pushy, but rather saying their good qualities\nBecause if you force it, people will resist\nAnd I feel like we're at a good balance where it's starting to become enforced like that\nSo I don't really know if there's anything we can do right now that isn't already being done, because if you do it too fast, people will resist\nAnd we've come a long way, and change takes time\nYes\nUm\nWell, they're probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job they have or where they're from\nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar isn't the best, but you're extremely intelligent and work your way up to a CEO job, even though you might not have the best grammar in the world or even though you might be intelligent, but you don't have the best grammar in the world\nOther men might look down upon you and be like, well how do I know you're really what you're saying if you can't even put verbs and nouns together right\nSo\nYeah\nSo like sometimes just where you're from can discriminate against you\nAnd like from gender to gender\nAnd I don't know\nI guess that'd be another example\nUm\nNot really",
            "My understanding is that they didn’t legalize it, they decriminalized it.\nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to more of a traffic ticket.\nYou know something you get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that.\nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited then for job interviews and all sorts of things like that,\nThose types of ramifications which are usually the worst of having a drug charge, would still be a concern.\nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge, well, depending on the charge.\nAt least for a marijuana charge, one thing that a lot of kids worry about, a lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized.\nBut at the same time, there is an argument that uh, I mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them and then to house them and then to let them go.\nAnd then it costs a lot, you know, to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times.\nAnd then appoint a public defender and then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges.\nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do.\nAnd I mean so,\nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble, I mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession, even if it would free up a lot of money for them.\nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that.\nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more liberal, then I think it’s totally fine.\nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education.\nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on food programs for the homeless people.\nUm so it’s important, cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere.\nAll over the streets and stuff.\nUm I mean for a variety of reasons,\nBut there’s this whole financial element to it as well.\nOther reasons like why it shouldn’t necessarily,\nWell no, I mean I I don’t know how I would feel about,\nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere.\nThen I mean a lot of people would be like smoking and driving.\nAnd um, it still is like taboo in our society,\nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts,\nUh to smoke marijuana.\nSo to have it out in the open like that,\nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people.\nUm and sorry what? The volume on the microphone is kind of low. Um I don’t really know. Um I think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills. Um but I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle as opposed to just their decision making motor skills. I mean but they they both have their adverse effects. And I mean they I feel like when it comes to substances in general, like no two people really react the same way. I mean and then people, some people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have. And then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t. So it makes it really hard to generalize about the substance when people react different ways. But I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects. Um yeah. Uh no I don’t",
            "I would say yes\nBecause\nUm\nA lot of the things they do are very traditional\nLike they’ve done the same things for a long time\nAnd\nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition\nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change\nUm\nI guess\nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week\nAnd\nUm\nThey’re very strict on how things are done\nAnd\nSometimes\nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee\nAnd\nUm\nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics\nAnd\nThey also don’t accept people of other religions\nUm\nLike\nFor example\nMy mom was an Episcopalian\nNo\nI’m sorry\nMy dad was an Episcopalian\nMy mom was a Catholic\nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church\nBecause of my dad’s religion\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s not really\nLike\nBeing tolerant of other religions\nUm\nWe always learned to\nYou know\nLove others\nThat’s a Catholic teaching\nBut\nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them\nIn a way like that\nSo\nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things\nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it\nBecause it’s so outdated\nBut they continue to stick with it anyway\n\nUm\nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it\nI mean\nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry\nBut\nAs\nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their\nLike\nPedophilic behavior\nSo\nBecause it’s just a different realm\nUm\nIt might\nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue\n\nUm\nWell\nI guess\nLike\nPeople who molest children\nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a\nA spouse or not\nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse\nSo if you’re going to do something like that\nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married\nLike\nI don’t think\nAllowing priests to be married would prevent\nUm\nThose things from happening\nI think that would probably happen regardless\n\nNope",
            "Um\nI don't\nI haven't really made up my mind about this issue yet\nSo\nI can't say if either side is right or wrong\nBut\nI do believe this is the trickiest topic we're facing today\nBecause\nSomething so close to the separation of church and state\nAnd\nHow to define marriage is something that is very tricky to do without offending anyone\nSo\nI don't know, I think\nI think that all civil unions\nI don't know whether marriage should be looked at\nAnd\nLike\nDefined by the government\nSeeing as it is a sacrament, like considered\nWell people wouldn't get tax breaks\nOr\nBe looked at any specific way by the government if they were baptized\nAnd\nSo\nIf you're married I think they should just look at it as a civil union\nBecause\nThat's what it is\nIt's two people\nThey shouldn't have separation of church and state\nThey shouldn't look into like well what kind of marriage was it\nTwo people got united together\nSo\nAnd\nThe fact that gay marriage\nI mean\nThat would just\nOh two people you got a civil union\n\nUm\nWell if all the states can come to a like logical conclusion then they should push to make it federal law\nBut\nA constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is just ridiculous\nIt is\nSomething like the constitution shouldn't just be amended for something\nI mean it is a very big cause for certain people\nBut\nIt’s not large enough that it should be a constitutional amendment\n\nIt’s just not important enough to amend the constitution\nTo define\nTo ban gay marriage\nSimply put\n\nUh\nNo",
            "**\nI was raised in a Christian home, so homosexuality is a bit of a grey area for me because I have many gay friends. I don't necessarily agree with that lifestyle. However, I think it should be legalized. I don't think it should be a national issue. Nevertheless, I believe it should be something that each state decides on their own rather than the president deciding for the entire country.\n\nMany states are democratic, and many are republican. Clearly, democratic states will push for gay marriage. And if you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I don't think you're necessarily in a position to disagree with that decision if a state decides to legalize gay marriage. You know, because you chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals, so I feel that it should be legalized based on the discretion of each state.\n\nI sort of already answered that, but\nYes, I don't think that Bush should be allowed to\nDecide that the whole country should be against gay marriage. I think it should be up to the individual states as to whether they want to legalize it. I don't agree with his ban on it.\n\nI just don't think that Bush doesn't live in every single state, so he shouldn't be able to decide how each state wants to run itself. I think that some things should be left up to each individual state. Plus, he's gonna be out of office in like what two years, and if a democratic president decides that he wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it's just going to go back and forth. It should just be up to each individual state because they're the ones that are gonna have to live with that decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n**",
            "Um\nNo, I don't in the slightest\nUm\nLet's see\nThe way I see it\nMyspace is a public platform\nAnd\nA bulletin\nYou know\nIf you look at the definition\nUm\nThen\nYou know\nThat’s basically to post for the public to see\nOr others to see\nUm\nWhatever it is you're trying to convey\nAnd\nNow if you post that on the internet\nUm\nYou know\nYou have to realize that people will be seeing that\nWhether it be school officials or not\nUm\nSo in my opinion, I feel as though the school officials seeing that\nThey had every right to see it\nBecause\nEven if they weren’t doing it under the school's name\nThey could have still accessed that\nUh\nThrough their homes\nUm\nBut uh\nYeah, with something preventing a school shooting\nYou know\nAs long as it saves the lives of\nUh\nStudents\nWhich is a responsibility of the school system\nI think that\nUh\nThat’s perfectly fine\nUm\nLet me see here\nLike\nUm\nYou know\nIf they go on the internet like on Myspace just to see if\nYou know\nStudents are drinking or smoking or doing stuff that they’re not supposed to be doing\nThey go on there just specifically to catch students\nAnd\nTo get them in trouble\nAnd\nI feel as though that is an invasion of privacy\nBut\nUm\nI feel as though\nYou know\nAs long as they save\nYou know\nSave lives or make the school a better and safer place\nI don’t think that that’s an invasion at all\nUm\nShould I elaborate more on that\n\nYeah um\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nHmm\nIt’s a lot easier to\nUh\nExpress yourself\nUm\nA lot longer when you’re writing\nBut\n\nAlright\nWell\nUm\nLike what I was saying\nIt is a public thing\nUm\nAnd with a student posting something on Myspace\nAnd\nNot expecting to get in trouble\nThat’s ridiculous\nUm\nEverything\nLike I’m\nUh\nWorried to post stuff like even through emails\nUm\nLike if I have something not good about somebody to say I don’t ever say that on an email\nBecause\nI’m afraid somebody somehow will pick that up\nAnd\nYou know\nEverything like\nEverything nowadays comes back\nAnd\nYou know\nBites you in the butt I guess you could say\n\nUm\nLike\nYou know\nIf you do something while you’re a college student then you grow up to be some important guy they will like find an email that you sent somehow\nAnd\nLike\nOnce it’s on the internet it’s always on the internet\nAnd\nUm\nYou know\nIf you do something like that there’s no way of getting out of it\nYou will get in trouble\nAnd\nI don’t\nIt wasn’t an invasion at all of privacy\nBecause\nYou know\nLike I said before\nAnd\nWell that’s basically all I’ve been saying was it’s a public thing\nAnd\nUm\nI don’t know\nLet’s see here\n\nUm\nLike I had said before I don’t feel as though they should go on the internet just to catch students\nBut\nIf they have something that leads them to the point where they would be making the school system a safer place\nUm\nThen I feel as though that’s perfectly fine for them\nOr\nUm\nOther officials such as the police to go on\nUm\nYou know\nWhen parents drop their students off at school they feel as though\nYou know\nThey’re dropping them off at a safe place\nI’ve actually discussed that with a\nUm\nA\nUh\nTeacher of mine\nI went to a public high school\nAnd\nUm\nThey say\nYou know\nWe have to ensure stuff like this\nBecause\nLike\nWe would do like lock downs\nAnd\nStuff\nAnd\nUm\nThat’s like in reference to the terrorist attacks\nUh\nWe had to be safe about that\nWe had like drill stuff\nAnd\nEven though that doesn’t have anything to do with the\nWell I mean it kind of does have something to do with the\nSchool shooting\nBecause\nUm\nThat was incase people would come into the building I guess\nUm\nSo we\nYou know\nWe did practice that stuff\nUm\nIn order to make the school a safer place\nAnd\nThat’s just what the school officials were doing in this case\nThey were just making it a safer place\nUm\nPreventing anything bad from happening\nLike\nColumbine or something like that\nUm\nYeah that’s basically all I can come up with\n\nUh no that’s about it",
